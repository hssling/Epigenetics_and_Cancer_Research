TITLE: Could GSTP1, PTEN and NKX3.1 gene expression be novel markers in the relationship between prostate cancer and epigenetics?
ABSTRACT: Although numerous treatment modalities exist for Prostate Cancer (PCa) with a complex pathophysiology, a significant worldwide health concern for males, early identification remains the paramount factor influencing disease prognosis. Proposed new biomarkers, including GSTP1, PTEN, and NKX3.1, may provide predictive and prognostic functions, hence enhancing the efficacy of PSA in diagnosing prostate cancer. Epigenetic variables associated with nutrition influence the blood gene expression levels of the new biomarkers GSTP1, PTEN, and NKX3.1. This study aimed to elucidate the correlation between nutrition-related epigenetic variables and the expression of the tumor suppressor genes GSTP1, PTEN, and NKX3.1 in benign prostate and prostate cancer patients.This study was conducted with 41 newly diagnosed prostate cancer and 42 benign prostate patients, all aged 40 years and older. Participants had specific anthropometric measurements taken, and seven-day food records were kept. Serum levels of novel biochemical markers GSTP1, PTEN, and NKX3.1 were measured using an Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) method. Expression analyses of tumor-protective GSTP1, PTEN, and NKX3.1 genes were performed on prostate tissues obtained from fresh prostate biopsies taken from the groups and were associated with nutritional status.A significant relationship was found between the serum levels of GSTP1, PTEN, and NKX3.1, which are important in the formation and treatment of prostate cancer, and Gleason grade, tumor stage, and surgical margin status (p < 0.05). However, significant relationships were found between many macro and micronutrients obtained from the dietary pattern and effective in epigenetic pathways and GSTP1, PTEN, and NKX3.1 gene expressions (p < 0.05).The findings of this investigation corroborated the notion that prospective novel markers, including GSTP1, PTEN, and NKX3.1, may serve predictive and prognostic functions in prostate cancer, hence enhancing the efficacy of PSA in its diagnosis. Dietary trends may influence the optimization of many epigenetic processes. Targeted therapeutic nutritional interventions designed to enhance gene expression will facilitate the formulation of prostate cancer prevention methods.© 2025. The Author(s).

TITLE: Nutrition, Environment, and Genetics in Colorectal Cancer. Epigenetics and Possible Future Perspective.
ABSTRACT: This review provides an overview of the relationship among nutritional, environmental, and genetic factors in the development of the chronic inflammatory state, starting from the inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) up to the onset of Colorectal Cancer (CRC). Finally, it also examines potential prospects and future topics of research taking into account the relation between nutrition and epigenetic factors.Evidence indicates that genetic and lifestyle-related factors play a crucial role in CRC etiology. Dietary intake may induce epigenetic alterations which in turn, result in carcinogenesis. Several bioactive components can modify epigenetic mechanisms, required for gene activation or silencing, thus, representing a potential way of preventing CRC. The gene-diet interaction analysis suggested some functions and pathways that may affect the CRC development. In this view, personalized nutrition, which is an approach that combines with new omics technologies, could represent a new possible key for personalized prevention and treatment in association with other cancer prevention and chemotherapeutic therapies.© 2025.

TITLE: Vitamin D as an Epigenetic Regulator: A Hypothetical Mechanism for Cancer Prevention via Inhibition of Oncogenic lncRNA HOTAIR.
ABSTRACT: Cancer remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide, arising from a complex interplay of genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors. Although the role of micronutrients in cancer development has received limited attention, growing evidence suggests that vitamins, particularly vitamin D, may influence oncogenic pathways. This hypothesis manuscript explores the potential interaction between vitamin D and the oncogenic long non-coding RNA HOTAIR, providing a novel mechanistic explanation for the inverse correlation between vitamin D status and cancer risk. We support our hypothesis with in silico docking evidence, suggesting that vitamin D binds to bioactive domains within the structured regions of HOTAIR, potentially disrupting its interaction with chromatin regulators such as PRC2. This concept may offer a novel approach to cancer prevention and therapy.

TITLE: The Exposome Perspective: Environmental and Infectious Agents as Drivers of Cancer Disparities in Low- and Middle-Income Countries.
ABSTRACT: Cancer disparities in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) arise from multifaceted interactions between environmental exposures, infectious agents, and systemic inequities, such as limited access to care. The exposome, a framework encompassing the totality of non-genetic exposures throughout life, offers a powerful lens for understanding these disparities. In LMICs, populations are disproportionately affected by air and water pollution, occupational hazards, and oncogenic infections, including human papillomavirus (HPV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and neglected tropical diseases, such as schistosomiasis. These infectious agents contribute to increased cancer susceptibility and poor outcomes, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. Moreover, climate change, food insecurity, and barriers to healthcare access exacerbate these risks. This review adopts a population-level exposome approach to explore how environmental and infectious exposures intersect with genetic, epigenetic, and immune mechanisms to influence cancer incidence and progression in LMICs. We highlight the critical pathways linking chronic exposure and inflammation to tumor development and evaluate strategies such as HPV and HBV vaccination, antiretroviral therapy, and environmental regulation. Special attention is given to tools such as exposome-wide association studies (ExWASs), which offer promise for exposure surveillance, early detection, and public health policy. By integrating exposomic insights into national health systems, especially in regions such as sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and South Asia, LMICs can advance equitable cancer prevention and control strategies. A holistic, exposome-informed strategy is essential for reducing global cancer disparities and improving outcomes in vulnerable populations.

TITLE: Epi-nutrients for cancer prevention: Molecular mechanisms and emerging insights.
ABSTRACT: The burgeoning field of epigenetics holds considerable potential in cancer prevention and management, as it targets mechanisms essential to regulating gene expression without altering DNA sequences. Epigenetic processes like DNA methylation, histone modifications, non-coding RNAs, and nucleosome remodelling-play an essential role in cellular differentiation and development, with dysfunction in these pathways often leading to malignancy. Targeting epigenetic regulators, including DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs), can suppress cancer cell proliferation, making epigenetics a promising therapeutic frontier. Phytochemicals, natural bioactive compounds predominantly found in vegetables, fruits, and seeds, offer a complementary approach to traditional cancer therapies through their epigenetic influence. These compounds exhibit anti-inflammatory, anti-angiogenic, and antioxidant properties, which modulate pathways and proteins involved in chromatin remodeling and may influence the mammalian epigenome. A diverse spectrum of bioactive dietary ingredients, including curcumin, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), genistein, quercetin, resveratrol, and sulforaphane, has gained significant interest for their ability to modulate gene expression and chromatin structure via epigenetic mechanisms. Their potential implications for cancer prevention and their role in regulating key epigenetic genes have been described in numerous investigations. This comprehensive review explores the molecular mechanisms by which dietary bioactive molecules may reverse epigenetic aberrations in cancer cells. It examines the influence of these compounds on DNA methylation, ten-eleven translocation (TET) enzymes, and histone modifications, while discussing their specific molecular targets in various cancer types. Additionally, we highlight the pathways through which these epi-nutrients may impact gene expression and enzyme activities associated with epigenetic regulation, which leads to innovative, diet-based anticancer strategies. Clinical trial number: not applicable.© 2025. The Author(s).

TITLE: The role of physical activity and epigenetic changes in colorectal cancer prevention.
ABSTRACT: Regular and consistent physical activity significantly reduces the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) by approximately 24% in men and 23% in women. There are several mechanisms through which exercise can help protect against CRC. For example, it can reduce chronic inflammation, boost the immune system, and cause positive epigenetic changes like DNA methylation and histone modifications. It increases the activity of immune cells like natural killer cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes, shifts macrophages to an anti-tumor state, and promotes a tumor-suppressive microenvironment. Exercise also positively affects the gut microbiome, increasing beneficial bacteria that produce anti-inflammatory short-chain fatty acids like butyrate, which strengthen gut health and support epigenetic regulation. Additionally, physical activity lowers oxidative stress, enhances DNA repair, and regulates hormones like insulin and IGF-1, which are associated with cancer progression. Although exercise benefits vary among individuals, especially between genders, it is still a powerful preventive and therapeutic tool for CRC. For patients and survivors, personalized exercise programs improve physical function, decrease fatigue, and improve overall quality of life. Overall, exercise offers a multifaceted approach to CRC prevention and management by targeting inflammation, immunity, epigenetics, and gut health, as this review explores.

TITLE: [Mechanisms and perspectives of B vitamins associated one carbon metabolism on colorectal cancer risk].
ABSTRACT: Colorectal cancer (CRC) represents a significant global health challenge as a common malignancy of the digestive tract. The involvement of B vitamins-specifically folic acid (B9), riboflavin (B2), pyridoxine (B6), and cobalamin (B12)-is crucial in metabolic processes by mediating the transfer of one-carbon (1C) units, which plays a fundamental role in cellular functions and tumor growth. 1C metabolism is involved in synthesis of proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, and other cofactors. 1C metabolism, intertwined with the metabolism of other nutrients, forms complex pathways where B vitamins act as precursors or coenzymes, influencing the production of various intermediates. These vitamins, as essential nutrients, are implicated to varying the pathogenesis and progression of colorectal cancer such as epigenetics. Furthermore, 1C metabolism affects tumor cell fate through multiple aspects including nucleotide synthesis, redox homeostasis, and the interaction with gut microbiota. Given these roles, understanding and monitoring B vitamin levels and their metabolic pathways are essential for colorectal cancer prevention and management. This approach not only helps in reducing tumor-related mortality but also opens new avenues for research into CRC mechanisms and potential therapeutic strategies.

TITLE: Epigenetics of Dietary Phytochemicals in Cancer Prevention: Fact or Fiction.
ABSTRACT: Cancer development takes 10 to 50 years, and epigenetics plays an important role. Recent evidence suggests that ~80% of human cancers are linked to environmental factors impinging upon genetics/epigenetics. Because advanced metastasized cancers are resistant to radiation/chemotherapeutic drugs, cancer prevention by relatively nontoxic "epigenetic modifiers" will be logical. Many dietary phytochemicals possess powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that are hallmarks of cancer prevention. Dietary phytochemicals can regulate gene expression of the cellular genome via epigenetic mechanisms. In this review, we will summarize preclinical studies that demonstrate epigenetic mechanisms of dietary phytochemicals in skin, colorectal, and prostate cancer prevention. Key examples of the importance of epigenetic regulation in carcinogenesis include hypermethylation of the NRF2 promoter region in cancer cells, resulting in inhibition of NRF2-ARE signaling. Many dietary phytochemicals demethylate NRF2 promoter region and restore NRF2 signaling. Phytochemicals can also inhibit inflammatory responses via hypermethylation of inflammation-relevant genes to block gene expression. Altogether, dietary phytochemicals are excellent candidates for cancer prevention due to their low toxicity, potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, and powerful epigenetic effects in reversing procarcinogenic events.Copyright © 2024 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.
