BackgroundMelanoma represents one of the most aggressive skin cancers, 
responsible for over 75% of skin cancer-related deaths despite comprising only 
5% of cases. Despite therapeutic advances, patient responses remain variable and 
unpredicv. The Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule (SLAM) family regulates 
immune cell communication, with SLAMF8 being predominantly expressed on myeloid 
cells. However, SLAMF8's specific role in melanoma pathogenesis remains largely 
unexplored.MethodsIn this retrospective integrative study, we systematically 
investigated SLAMF8's role in melanoma through multi-omics analyses using TIMER, 
GEPIA, and UALCAN databases, following the STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting 
of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) guidelines for observational data 
reporting. Functional studies were conducted in A-375 and SK-MEL-28 melanoma 
cell lines using siRNA-mediated knockdown, followed by migration, invasion, and 
proliferation assays. DNA methylation patterns were analyzed via the SMART 
database, while mutation profiles were examined using cBioPortal and COSMIC. 
Immune infiltration analysis was performed through TIMER, and pathway 
associations were investigated using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis and 
protein-protein interaction networks. Finally, two-sample Mendelian 
Randomization analysis assessed the causal relationship between SLAMF8 
expression and melanoma susceptibility.ResultsSLAMF8 expression was 
significantly higher in metastatic melanoma compared to primary tumors, with 
expression patterns varying across disease stages and between sexes. Higher 
SLAMF8 expression correlated with improved disease-free and overall survival. 
Functional studies demonstrated that SLAMF8 knockdown significantly enhanced 
melanoma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. DNA methylation analysis 
revealed significant negative correlations between methylation at specific CpG 
sites and SLAMF8 expression, with hypermethylation associated with worse 
survival outcomes. Mutation analysis identified alterations in 10.21% of 
melanoma patients. Immune infiltration studies demonstrated strong correlations 
between SLAMF8 expression and enhanced immune cell presence. GSEA linked SLAMF8 
to critical immune pathways including allograft rejection, inflammatory 
response, and interferon signaling. Mendelian Randomization analysis established 
a protective causal relationship between SLAMF8 and melanoma risk (OR = 0.39, 
95% CI = 0.21-0.74, p = 3.34e-03).ConclusionOur study demonstrates that SLAMF8 
plays a critical role in melanoma by suppressing tumor progression and 
modulating the immune microenvironment. Elevated SLAMF8 expression in metastatic 
melanoma is associated with improved patient survival, suggesting its utility as 
a prognostic biomarker. Furthermore, its tumor-suppressive effects and 
immune-regulatory functions highlight SLAMF8 as a promising therapeutic target 
for melanoma treatment strategies.

BACKGROUND: While DNA methylation profiling from peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells (PBMCs) has demonstrated utility in cancer risk prediction, notably for 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), its prognostic value for survival 
stratification in Chinese lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients remains 
unestablished. This study addresses whether PBMC-derived methylation signatures 
can discriminate clinical outcomes in EGFR-mutation LUAD subgroups.
METHODS: We performed genome-wide methylation analysis of PBMCs from LUAD 
patients using the Infinium Methylation EPIC 850 K array. Clinical 
characteristics were associated with overall survival (OS) through Cox 
regression. Prognostic differentially methylated positions (DMPs) were 
identified via Lasso regression, followed by the construction of risk-score 
models. Functional enrichment (KEGG/GO) and tissue microarray-based 
immunohistochemistry (IHC) for FKBP4 expression (n = 90 LUAD samples) were 
conducted. Analyses were conducted in R 4.4.1 with curated Bioconductor 
packages.
RESULTS: In the retrospective cohort of 174 Chinese LUAD patients (April 
2014-September 2019), PBMC analysis of 128 cases revealed 12 hypomethylated DMPs 
were associated with OS. EGFR-mutant patients (n = 66) showed 325 significant 
DMPs (|Δβ|≥ 0.06, P ≤ 0.01), with four DMPs (cg05802998, cg19313959, cg00685115, 
cg15224444) independently predicting OS. The cg19313959 located in the TSS1500 
region of FKBP4 gene (Δβ = 0.21) demonstrated the strongest methylation shift. 
Reduced FKBP4 protein expression was associated with improved survival 
(HR = 0.42, 95%CI 0.24-0.72). In EGFR-wildtype patients (n = 51), three 
prognostic DMPs emerged from 2,531 candidates. EGFR mutation-specific prognostic 
scoring models were established successfully, while pathway analyses revealed 
divergent biological processes between EGFR subgroups.
CONCLUSION: In this epigenome-wide study based on PBMCs in Chinese patients with 
LUAD, methylation signatures dependent on EGFR mutations and predictive of 
survival were identified.

BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies have shown a small but significantly 
increased risk of leukemia in children conceived by in vitro fertilization. 
Atypical DNA methylation patterns observed in pediatric cancers are suspected to 
occur in utero, and it is known that periconceptional conditions linked to 
assisted reproductive technologies (ART) are responsible for DNA methylation 
modifications.
RESULTS: Using databases and systematic literature screens, we derived a list of 
cancer/leukemia genes (n = 1246 and n = 532 genes, respectively, corresponding 
to 1466 individual genes) and of differentially methylated genes (DMG) in 
leukemia (n = 2642) and pre-leukemia (n = 381). These lists were 
cross-referenced with DMG (n = 93) curated from 18 ART Epigenome-Wide 
Association Studies (EWAS) (2369 samples). Among the ART DMG, more than 
one-third (n = 33) were leukemia, and six were pre-leukemia DMG, all 
representing a significant enrichment. Seven of the enriched genes (NTM, PRSS16, 
SCAND3, SYCP1, TP73, ZNF184, and ISL1-DT) showed concordant methylation between 
ART and leukemia/pre-leukemia. Moreover, five of the ART DMG are known targets 
for somatic/germline alterations in leukemia: ATP10A, CHD2, FBRSL1, FGFR2, and 
SORCS1. The ART DMG were not significantly enriched in cancer genes, supporting 
the hypothesis that ART may not link broadly to any cancer type but rather to 
leukemia.
CONCLUSION: This study indicates that relatively few genes that are known 
targets for somatic/germline mutation in cancer experience DNA methylation 
changes in individuals conceived through ART. By contrast, DNA methylation 
disturbances reported in leukemia represent more than one-third of those 
associated with ART conception, thus raising the question of their role in 
leukemia risk in ART-conceived individuals. Among them, a few critical genes 
such as TP73, a tumor suppressor, were shown to be targeted for 
hypermethylation, both in ART and leukemia, warranting further investigation.

BACKGROUND: Endocrine science remains underrepresented in European Union 
research programs despite the fundamental role of hormone health in human 
wellbeing. Analysis of the CORDIS database reveals a persistent gap between the 
societal impact of endocrine disorders and their research prioritization. At 
national funding level, endocrine societies report limited or little attention 
of national research funding toward endocrinology. The EndoCompass project-a 
joint initiative between the European Society of Endocrinology and the European 
Society of Paediatric Endocrinology, aimed to identify and promote strategic 
research priorities in endocrine science to address critical hormone-related 
health challenges.
METHODS: Research priorities were established through comprehensive analysis of 
the EU CORDIS database covering the Horizon 2020 framework period (2014-2020). 
Expert consultation in pituitary and neuroendocrine tumor endocrinology was 
conducted to identify key research priorities, followed by broader stakeholder 
engagement including society members and patient advocacy groups.
RESULTS: Research priorities encompass congenital and acquired disorders, tumor 
development and progression, and neuroendocrine neoplasms. Key areas include 
genetic/epigenetic factors, tumor microenvironment, personalized treatment 
approaches, developing preclinical models, and implementing artificial 
intelligence. Special emphasis is placed on aggressive tumors, hypothalamic 
syndromes, and establishing pan-European biobanks and databases.
CONCLUSIONS: This component of the EndoCompass project provides an 
evidence-based roadmap for strategic research investment. This framework 
identifies crucial investigation areas into pituitary-neuroendocrine disease 
pathophysiology, prevention, and treatment strategies, ultimately aimed at 
reducing the burden of these disorders on individuals and society. The findings 
support the broader EndoCompass objective of aligning research funding with 
areas of highest potential impact in endocrine health.

BACKGROUND: The trace elements (TEs) selenium, zinc, copper, manganese, iodine 
and iron are essential micronutrients that support essential metabolic 
functions. Imbalance in their homeostasis might contribute to the pathogenesis 
of major age-related chronic diseases including type 2 diabetes (T2D) and 
cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Emerging evidence suggests that TEs may affect 
health outcomes via epigenetic changes. However, few epigenome-wide association 
studies (EWAS) have explored TE-associated DNA methylation markers and their 
links to chronic disease outcomes.
METHODS: We conducted TE-specific exploratory EWAS using a random subcohort 
(n = 1030) from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition 
(EPIC)-Potsdam cohort. The association between identified CpG sites and incident 
chronic diseases was evaluated using a case-cohort design comprising random 
subcohort participants and incident cases of T2D (n = 654) and CVD (n = 334). 
DNA methylation was measured with the MethylationEPIC BeadChip array. We used 
Prentice-weighted Cox proportional hazards regression models to estimate 
multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) 
for the associations of TE-associated CpG sites with each incident chronic 
disease.
RESULTS: In the copper EWAS, we identified six CpG sites (cg00398673, 
cg03957124, cg05736499, cg07573872, cg11503550, and cg18513344) that were 
significantly associated with serum copper concentrations with a False Discovery 
Rate < 0.05. All associated CpG sites showed lower methylation levels in 
association with higher serum copper levels. Higher methylation levels of 
cg00398673 (HR per SD: 0.74, 95% CI 0.63-0.88), cg03957124 (HR per SD: 0.52, 95% 
CI 0.41-0.66), cg05736499 (HR Q5 vs Q1: 0.25, 95% CI 0.14-0.47), and cg18513344 
(HR Q5 vs Q1: 0.37, 95% CI 0.24-0.57) were associated with decreased risk of 
developing T2D, and higher methylation levels of cg07573872 were associated with 
decreased risk of developing CVD (HR per SD: 0.85, 95% CI 0.72-0.99). We did not 
observe any CpG sites that were significantly associated with other TEs.
CONCLUSIONS: Serum copper levels are inversely associated with a number of CpG 
sites. Methylation levels at these CpG sites were inversely associated with 
developing T2D and CVD. These findings may provide new insights on understanding 
the increased risk of T2D and CVD with elevated blood copper levels.

Although generally unknown, the age of a newly diagnosed tumor encodes valuable 
etiologic and prognostic information. Here, we estimate the age of breast 
cancers, defined as the time from the start of growth to detection, using a 
measure of epigenetic entropy derived from genome-wide methylation arrays. Based 
on an ensemble of neutrally fluctuating CpG (fCpG) sites, this stochastic 
epigenetic clock differs from conventional clocks that measure age-related 
increases in methylation. We show that younger tumors exhibit hallmarks of 
aggressiveness, such as increased proliferation and genomic instability, whereas 
older tumors are characterized by elevated immune infiltration, indicative of 
enhanced immune surveillance. These findings suggest that the clock captures a 
tumor's effective growth rate resulting from the evolutionary-ecological 
competition between intrinsic growth potential and external systemic pressures. 
Because of the clock's ability to differentiate old and stable from young and 
aggressive tumors, it has potential applications in risk stratification of 
early-stage breast cancers and guiding early detection efforts.

Primary prostate cancer presents with multifocal lesions and unpredictable 
clinical behavior, posing significant challenges for effective prognosis. To 
address this, we investigate the epigenomic landscape of prostate tumor biopsies 
from 25 treatment-naïve male patients by analyzing chromatin 
compartmentalization patterns. Our analysis reveals two distinct molecular 
subtypes: one with a Low Degree of Decompartmentalization (LDD) and another with 
a High Degree of Decompartmentalization (HDD). Here we show that the HDD 
subgroup exhibits extensive chromatin reorganization associated with diminished 
oncogenic potential. This subtype shows repression of molecular pathways 
involved in extracellular matrix remodeling and cellular plasticity. From this 
distinction, we derive an 18-gene transcriptional signature capable of 
differentiating HDD from LDD cases. Importantly, we validate the prognostic 
relevance of this signature in multiple independent cohorts totaling over 900 
patients. Our findings suggest that epigenetic-derived signature at the time of 
diagnostic biopsy can offer a powerful tool for risk stratification in prostate 
cancer.

INTRODUCTION: TEA domain transcription factor 4 (TEAD4), a key effector of the 
Hippo signaling pathway, has been increasingly associated with tumorigenesis and 
cancer progression. Despite its recognized role, comprehensive pan-cancer 
analyses of TEAD4 expression patterns, prognostic significance, and therapeutic 
implications remain scarce.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic evaluation of TEAD4 across diverse tumor 
types using publicly available datasets, including TCGA. Analyses included gene 
expression profiling, prognostic correlation, functional enrichment, and drug 
sensitivity assessments. Additionally, in vitro assays were performed to 
validate the functional roles of TEAD4 in cancer cell behavior.
RESULTS: TEAD4 was significantly overexpressed in multiple cancers and 
associated with unfavorable prognosis. Functional enrichment analyses implicated 
TEAD4 in oncogenic processes such as proliferation, metastasis, stemness 
maintenance, and immune regulation. In vitro experiments confirmed that TEAD4 
promotes cancer cell proliferation, migration, and stem cell-like properties, 
while TEAD4 knockdown reversed these phenotypes. TEAD4 expression correlated 
with genomic instability, epigenetic alterations, and remodeling of the tumor 
microenvironment. Drug sensitivity analysis indicated that elevated TEAD4 levels 
were linked to resistance against several chemotherapeutic agents. Furthermore, 
a prognostic model based on TEAD4 target gene expression successfully stratified 
patients by survival risk.
DISCUSSION: Our findings highlight the multifaceted roles of TEAD4 in cancer 
biology, emphasizing its contribution to tumor progression, therapy resistance, 
and patient outcomes. The evidence supports TEAD4 as a promising prognostic 
biomarker and therapeutic target, offering new avenues for translational cancer 
research.

BACKGROUND: Bladder cancer (BC) is the ninth most prevalent cancer globally, 
with approximately 75% of cases classified as non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer 
(NMIBC). Although transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) is the 
standard treatment for NMIBC, there remains a considerable risk of postoperative 
residual tumors. Accurately identifying patients who require repeat 
transurethral resection of bladder tumor (Re-TURBT) remains a significant 
clinical challenge. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exhibits high accuracy in 
detecting residual tumors after TURBT, aiding clinical decision-making. However, 
its relatively low specificity limits its clinical applicability. Urinary 
methylation markers, particularly those associated with H4 cluster protein 6 
(H4C6) and Twist Family BHLH Transcription Factor 1 (TWIST1), have demonstrated 
high sensitivity and specificity in detecting bladder cancer, showing promising 
clinical performance. The combined detection of H4C6 and TWIST1 gene methylation 
provides a more reliable method for identifying residual tumors post-TURBT. 
Integrating the VI-RADS score with urine gene methylation analysis could 
complement each other, improving the accuracy of residual tumor detection and 
enhancing clinical applicability.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the predictive value of 
clinical/pathological factors, urinary H4C6 and TWIST1 gene methylation, and 
their combined performance in identifying postoperative residual tumors in NMIBC 
patients.
METHODS: Morning urine samples from NMIBC patients at Zhongshan City People's 
Hospital (June 2022-August 2024) were analyzed for H4C6 and TWIST1 methylation 
levels. Patients underwent MRI and Re-TURBT. Logistic regression was used to 
identify predictors of residual tumors, and a nomogram was developed. Model 
performance was evaluated using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves 
and decision curve analysis (DCA).
RESULTS: Among the 55 patients included in the study, the area under the ROC 
curve (AUC) for urinary H4C6 methylation was 0.698, whereas TWIST1 methylation 
had an AUC of 0.758. Combined dual-gene methylation yielded an AUC of 0.764. The 
AUC for VI-RADS scoring was 0.888. When dual-gene methylation and hematuria were 
combined with VI-RADS scores, the prediction model achieved an AUC of 0.972. DCA 
demonstrated that the prediction model offers substantial clinical benefit 
across a broad range of threshold probabilities. The combined prediction model 
of dual-gene methylation, hematuria, and VI-RADS scores offers a powerful 
non-invasive method to assist clinicians in identifying high-risk patients with 
residual tumors after TURBT, thereby reducing unnecessary Re-TURBT and improving 
patient management.
CONCLUSION: Urinary H4C6 and TWIST1 gene methylation, along with VI-RADS 
scoring, show high diagnostic performance in predicting residual tumors 
following TURBT in NMIBC patients. A combined prediction model incorporating 
dual-gene methylation, hematuria, and VI-RADS scores achieves superior 
discrimination, excellent calibration, and strong clinical utility.

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) exhibits complex epigenetic dysregulation 
that impacts treatment response and prognosis, yet comprehensive analysis 
linking epigenetic signatures to clinical outcomes remains limited. We 
integrated single-cell RNA sequencing data from 42 NSCLC and 11 normal samples 
with bulk transcriptomics from multiple cohorts (TCGA-NSCLC [n = 993], GSE13213 
[n = 110], GSE42127 [n = 176]). Cell types were annotated using scMayoMap and 
validated through marker gene analysis. Epigenetic patterns across 15 cell types 
were characterized using single-sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA). 
Through weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), we identified key 
epigenetic regulatory modules and their associated genes. We systematically 
evaluated 111 machine learning algorithms to develop an epigenetic-based risk 
stratification model, with Random Survival Forest (RSF) emerging as the optimal 
approach. Experimental validation confirmed significant upregulation of key 
model genes at both mRNA (qRT-PCR: SLC2A1, LAD1, LYPD3; all p < 0.01) and 
protein levels (immunohistochemistry) in tumor tissues compared to adjacent 
normal tissues. Furthermore, functional experiments demonstrated that 
overexpression of LYPD3 significantly promoted NSCLC cell proliferation, 
migration, and invasion in vitro, corroborating computational findings and 
providing strong mechanistic validation of the model. Drug sensitivity analysis 
revealed differential therapeutic vulnerabilities, with high-risk patients 
showing increased sensitivity to EGFR-TKIs, including Gefitinib (p < 0.001). The 
model demonstrated significant prognostic value in kidney chromophobe 
(p = 0.040), kidney clear cell carcinoma (p < 0.001), and cervical squamous cell 
carcinoma (p = 0.004). Our study establishes a robust epigenetic-based 
prognostic model for NSCLC and identifies LYPD3 as a novel oncogenic driver, 
providing insights into tumor biology and treatment response, offering potential 
clinical utility for personalized therapeutic strategies.

Autologous hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) transplantation is 
performed after myeloablation in cancer treatment to restore blood cell 
production and support immune recovery. Despite its success in achieving 
survivorship, many recipients later suffer from recurrent infections and 
pulmonary complications. The mechanisms driving the complications after HSPC 
transplantation later in life are unknown. However, the induction and/or 
maintenance therapeutics might be driving the negative outcomes in treated 
patients. We investigated the effects of the cancer therapeutics topotecan and 
13-cis-retinoic acid (13cisRA) on cell phenotype and functions of HSPCs isolated 
from cord blood and primary monocytes from adult donors. In HSPCs, 13cisRA 
reduced autophagy and lysosomal activity, triggered a DNA damage response 
through increased γH2A.X and CDKN2 expression (including the spliced p14ARF 
isoform), and upregulated the epigenetic regulator SIRT3. 13cisRA also activated 
primary monocytes, inducing CXCL8 and CCL2 production. By contrast, topotecan 
had no effects on mature monocytes but induced DNA damage, metabolic remodeling, 
and epigenetic alterations in HSPCs. These changes included increased CDKN1A 
expression, higher γH2A.X-positive cell frequency, autophagy activation, and 
SIRT1 upregulation. The differential effects of 13cisRA and topotecan on HSPCs 
and monocytes might underlie the long-term complications of autologous HSPC 
transplantation. By modulating DNA damage, autophagy, and epigenetic pathways, 
these therapies could influence hematopoietic recovery and immune 
reconstitution, offering insights for improving transplantation outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer (CC), primarily linked to persistent HPV infection, 
arises from complex genetic and epigenetic alterations. The early detection of 
cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) allows for CC prevention. Recent data 
highlights the importance of epigenetic biomarkers, including non-coding RNAs 
such as miR-21 and miR-34a. Our aim was to investigate the interplay between 
Ki-67 and p53 expression and their epigenetic regulation by miR-21 and miR-34a 
to better predict the course of CIN.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tumor biopsies from 50 patients with CIN 1-3/HSIL were 
analyzed. We performed immunohistochemical analysis of Ki-67 and p53 expression 
and qRT-PCR for the analysis of miRNA expression.
RESULTS: The average miR-21 and miR-34a levels were 5.8 ± 2.8 and 1.42 ± 0.85 
(a.u.), respectively, while Ki-67 and p53 averaged 136.9 ± 79.9 and 93.15 ± 49.5 
H-score points. Positive correlations were found between miR-21 and Ki-67 (r = 
0.76) and miR-34a and p53 expressions (r = 0.65). Tumors with low Ki-67 showed 
2.48-fold lower miR-21 levels, and low p53 tumors showed 4.2-fold lower miR-34a 
levels. While no correlation with age or menstrual status was found, miR-21 (r = 
0.78), Ki-67 (r = 0.68), and miR-34a (r = -0.59) correlated with CIN grading (p 
< 0.05). The miR-21 and Ki-67 levels increased in CIN 2 and CIN 3 compared to 
CIN 1 in both HPV-positive and HPV-negative samples. The miR-34a levels were the 
lowest in CIN 3 HPV-negative samples and significantly decreased with CIN 
progression in HPV-positive samples. The p53 levels were significantly higher in 
CIN 3 cases of both the HPV-positive and HPV-negative groups.
CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that the miR‑21, miR-34a, Ki-67, and p53 
expression levels are significantly correlated with each other and are 
distinctly associated with the progression of CIN grades and HPV status, 
highlighting their potential as crucial CC biomarkers.

Tumor heterogeneity has been recognized as a critical characteristic of Ovarian 
Cancer (OC), significantly influencing chemotherapeutic response and overall 
patient survival. The VEGF/VEGFR2 signaling pathway genes serve as risk factor 
for metastasis and are associated with poor prognosis in many cancers including 
OC. DNA methylation of VEGF-A, VEGF-C and VEGFR2 genes contributing to their 
genetic changes based on histological sub-types has not been thoroughly explored 
in OC. Thus, the study aimed to determine the DNA methylation status of these 
genes in relation to their expression in tumor tissues and associated peritoneal 
fluid samples to evaluate usefulness of methylation as a prognostic indicator in 
ovarian carcinoma for future targeted therapies. Bisulfite-modified DNA 
methylation was assessed via Methylation-Specific Polymerase chain reaction 
(MSP) and mRNA expression was examined via quantitative reverse transcription 
PCR (RT-PCR), respectively. Gene expression and promoter methylation were 
examined in relation with clinical parameters in 100 OC samples. The methylation 
frequency of VEGF-A, VEGF-C and VEGFR2 promoters was higher in tumor tissues and 
matched Peritoneal Fluid (PF) compared to normal samples, while VEGF-A, VEGF-C 
and VEGFR2 mRNA expression levels were significantly elevated. Promoter 
methylation levels for VEGF-A (82%), VEGF-C (76%) and VEGFR2 (82%) showed 
significantly higher levels compared to benign cystadenomas, whereas amounts of 
VEGF-A and VEGFR2 were significantly higher than benign samples (p = 0.0003 and 
0.001). Expression and promoter methylation for VEGF-A (p = 0.0004, 0.0001) and 
VEGFR2 (p = 0.005, 0.001) significantly correlated with differences in 
histological sub-types in OC samples. No significant correlation was observed 
between promoter methylation and expression levels for VEGF-A, VEGF-C and VEGFR2 
genes. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis predicts poor prognosis for concurrent 
high expression and methylation of VEGF-A and VEGFR2 significantly correlated 
with advanced stage (log-rank p = 0.03, 0.01) and tumor histology (log rank 
p = 0.02, 0.01 respectively) in OC patients. Promoter methylation status of the 
VEGF-A and VEGFR2 genes could serve as valuable prognostic indicator in 
predicting poor prognosis in OC patients based on tumor histological sub-types.

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection mediates activation of oncogenes and 
inhibition of tumor suppressor genes through aberrant DNA methylation, which is 
the predominant risk factor for gastric tumorigenesis. Here, by integrating 
transcriptome and epigenetic multi-omics analyses of gastric tissues and mouse 
models, we identified that inhibitor of differentiation 4 (ID4) was 
downregulated in H. pylori-infected gastric tissues and associated with 
prognosis of gastric cancer (GC). H. pylori infection remarkably increased the 
methylation level of the ID4 promoter region in the GC patients and mouse 
models. ID4 served as a tumor suppressor gene in GC and was required for H. 
pylori-mediated tumorigenic activities in vitro cellular and in vivo 
tumor-bearing mouse models. Moreover, H. pylori infection induced DNMT3B 
upregulation through recruiting KLF5 to its promoter and further promoted ID4 
DNA methylation modification. Notably, ID4 formed heterodimers with the basic 
HLH transcription factors DEC1 to inhibit its transcriptional activity; 
therefore, downregulation of ID4 promoted SHH/GLI1 signaling through a DEC1 
dependent transcriptional modulation. Collectively, our findings indicate H. 
pylori infection depends on DNMT3B to induce ID4 DNA methylation and ID4 
promoter hypermethylation status is a potential biomarker to identify GC. Loss 
of ID4 could be a key component of H. pylori-mediated gastric tumorigenesis 
through dysregulation of DEC1/SHH/GLI1 axis, which provides potential 
therapeutic targets in GC.

Histone acetylation, a fundamental component of epigenetic modification, plays a 
pivotal role in the progression, treatment, and prognosis of numerous cancers. 
In this study, we systematically investigated, for the first time, the clinical 
value of histone acetylation (HAT) modification in the prognostic assessment of 
cervical cancer. Utilizing the GSE44001 and The Cancer Genome Atlas-CESC 
databases, a HAT-associated prognostic model comprising 7 pivotal genes was 
formulated through Lasso-Cox regression analysis. The integration of multiple 
bioinformatics algorithms (including Cibersort, ESTIMATE, ssGSEA, and TIDE) has 
enabled the profound delineation of immune microenvironmental characteristics 
among disparate risk groups. Utilizing molecular docking technology, we 
conducted a screening process that identified 2 potential target drugs. The 
prognostic model's predictive efficacy was successfully validated in an 
independent cohort. The analysis has revealed that the high-risk group exhibits 
a pronounced immunosuppressive phenotype. The study identified 2 additional 
factors that contribute to the prognosis of cervical cancer: CPE and PGK1. These 
factors have been shown to be significantly associated with poor clinical 
outcomes. In addition, we have identified 2 drugs that may target CPE and PGK1, 
namely Z-LLNle-CHO and OSU-03-012. The discovery of these drugs has opened up a 
new potential pathway for overcoming resistance to immunotherapy. This study 
addresses a significant research gap concerning HAT in the prognostic assessment 
of cervical cancer. Furthermore, it offers a crucial molecular basis for 
clinical decisions regarding individualized therapeutic interventions.

BACKGROUND: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains a leading cause of 
cancer-related mortality worldwide. Despite advancements in treatment, drug 
resistance and limited therapeutic efficacy persist, underscoring the urgent 
need for novel and mechanistically informed therapeutic strategies. Identifying 
genetically supported drug targets may accelerate the development of precision 
therapies in NSCLC.
METHODS: We implemented an integrative multi-omics framework combining 
single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), genome-wide association studies (GWAS), 
and molecular quantitative trait locus (QTL) datasets including expression 
(eQTL), protein (pQTL), and DNA methylation (mQTL) QTLs. Druggable candidates 
were systematically evaluated using a suite of Mendelian randomization (MR) 
approaches-including summary data-based MR (SMR), generalized SMR (GSMR), and 
genetic risk score (GRS) analysis. Epigenetic regulation and downstream 
signaling were further explored through mediation MR analysis.
RESULTS: C4BPA, a complement-regulatory macromolecule, emerged as a risk factor 
for NSCLC across multiple MR models, with consistent findings validated at both 
transcriptomic and proteomic levels. Epigenetic activation of C4BPA via DNA 
methylation was observed, and C4BPA expression was shown to promote NSCLC 
progression through the inflammatory chemokine CCL8 signaling axis. Sensitivity 
analyses confirmed the robustness of association inference.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings identify C4BPA as a genetically validated and 
biologically plausible therapeutic target for NSCLC. This study demonstrates the 
power of integrating single-cell transcriptomics with population-scale omics and 
association inference to uncover actionable targets, offering a scalable 
framework for advancing precision oncology in lung cancer.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths and obesity 
is a known risk factor for its development and poor prognosis. Adipose tissue 
(AT) actively contributes to CRC progression and cachexia. Here, we investigated 
molecular crosstalk between tumor cells and different visceral AT depots 
(normal, intra- and peri-tumoral), focusing on metabolic and (epi)genetic 
alterations. Using WGS analysis, we explored VAT role in CRC progression, 
demonstrating how its proximity to the tumor impacts metabolic and phenotypic 
changes. Intra-VAT (within 5 cm of lesion), closest to the tumor, underwent 
significant metabolic remodeling, characterized by upregulation of markers of 
the white-brown AT transition (UCP-1, TMEM26), lipid metabolism (PON3) and a 
reduction in adipocyte turnover (Pref-1, adiponectin). Peri-VAT (within 15 cm) 
and HVAT (over 15 cm) exhibited progressively fewer alterations, suggesting a 
gradient effect of tumor on surrounding AT. Intra-VAT displayed increased 
fibrosis (TGF-β, collagen) and cachexia-related markers (IL-8), and mutations in 
key oncogenes (KRAS, HLA, MET), highlighting a direct interaction between tumor 
cells and AT driving CRC progression. Mutations in genes such as KRAS, HLA, and 
PIK3CA were shared between CRC and its Intra-VAT, indicating potential 
biomarkers for tumor progression and immune evasion. miRNA analysis revealed 
upregulation of miR-21 and miR-92a in Intra-VAT, with circulating miR-92a 
correlating with increased body fat and decreased lean mass in CRC patients, 
suggesting their involvement in both local metabolic remodeling and systemic 
changes. Altered PON3 DNA methylation patterns were also observed, correlating 
with metabolic parameters. Our findings underscore AT's critical role in the CRC 
microenvironment as an active player in CRC progression and cachexia. Metabolic 
and genetic alterations decreased in VAT with increasing distance from the 
tumor. Intra-VAT may serve as a critical therapeutic target and biomarker for 
CRC progression, impacting surgical and postoperative strategies. Future studies 
should focus on targeting tumor-adipose crosstalk to improve treatment outcomes, 
including experimental validation of the identified genetic alterations and 
investigation of their functional roles in tumor progression and immune evasion.

Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is a rare pediatric 
myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by distinct epigenetic 
signatures that facilitate molecular classification. This study aimed to 
evaluate the diagnostic utility of locus-specific DNA methylation in the bone 
morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) gene as a single predictor of disease outcomes in 
a cohort of 111 children diagnosed with JMML, alongside 9 healthy controls. 
Methylation levels of BMP4, assessed through targeted bisulfite next-generation 
sequencing (bs-NGS), were heterogeneous within the JMML cohort and were 
significantly associated with clinical risk factors, such as patient age, and 
fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels. A comparative analysis of BMP4 bs-NGS and 
genome-wide methylation array data revealed a strong positive correlation 
(p < 0.001). The sensitivity and specificity of BMP4 bs-NGS for classifying 
high-methylation cases were 0.612 and 0.887, respectively. For PTPN11-mutant 
patients (N = 40), the sensitivity was 0.667 and the specificity was 0.842. 
Survival analysis indicated that patients with high BMP4 methylation (BMP4h) had 
lower 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rates than those with normal BMP4 
methylation (BMP4n). Specifically, the 20% of patients with highest BMP4 
methylation had a 5-year DFS of 0.38, in contrast to 0.62 for the lowest 20% 
(p = 0.007). These findings highlight the potential of BMP4 methylation analysis 
as a complementary biomarker for JMML risk stratification, mirroring genome-wide 
methylation profiles known to associate with prognostic subgroups.

BACKGROUND: The expression of imprinted genes, which depends on their gamete of 
origin, is regulated by DNA sequences characterized by differential methylation 
between the maternal and paternal alleles (also known as germline differentially 
methylated regions or gDMRs). The most common molecular defect associated with 
Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS), a condition linked to overgrowth and tumours, 
is the loss of methylation of the KCNQ1OT1-TSS gDMR located on chromosome 
11p15.5 (also known as IC2 LoM). Approximately one-third of BWS patients with 
IC2 LoM exhibit multi-locus imprinting disturbances (MLID). While 
maternal-effect variants in proteins of the oocyte subcortical maternal complex 
(SCMC) have been linked to MLID, the underlying mechanisms and health impact of 
this epigenetic disturbance remain unclear.
RESULTS: We used the Infinium EPIC methylation array to investigate whole-genome 
CpG methylation in 64 BWS patients with IC2 LoM and 37 control subjects. We 
distinguished two patient groups, one with a variable methylation level of 24 
gDMRs and the other with single-locus IC2 LoM. We observed that the mothers of 
the former patient group carried more variants in maternal-effect genes than 
those of the latter group, and 50% of them, but none of the latter group had 
variants in the SCMC genes. Additionally, in the former group, the mothers were 
older at the time of pregnancy, and the patients showed higher variation in 
methylation levels of thousands of CpGs located in non-imprinted loci, including 
protochaderins and cancer-associated genes. We found no differences in clinical 
features or in the incidence of assisted reproductive technology between the two 
patient groups. However, multiple affected siblings and recurrent miscarriages 
were observed only among cases with biallelic maternal-effect SCMC gene 
variants.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the BWS patients with MLID exhibit 
highly variable methylation changes that affect both imprinted and non-imprinted 
loci in a seemingly stochastic manner throughout the genome. These findings 
support the hypothesis that MLID results from the interaction of maternal-effect 
genes and environmental factors in aged oocytes, leading to disordered DNA 
methylation in the whole genome. Future research should investigate whether and 
how these epimutations impact the health of affected individuals, particularly 
in adulthood.

OBJECTIVE: Increasing evidence indicated substantial involvement of 
non-Helicobacter pylori microbiota in gastric tumorigenesis. We aimed to 
elucidate detailed relationship of microbiome dynamics between two different 
steps in gastric cancer (GC) such as cancer initiation and progression, and 
assessed their associations with clinicopathological and molecular changes.
METHODS: We systemically characterized gastric microbiome during GC initiation 
and progression using 944 biopsies from primary GC, non-cancerous gastric mucosa 
from both GC and non-cancer subjects. The association between specific microbial 
characteristics and GC risk, prognosis and molecular changes such as TP53 
mutation, DNA methylation and telomere shortening were also evaluated.
RESULTS: Microbial α-diversity in the gastric mucosa was decreased in relation 
to the GC occurrence, while it increased in primary GC tissue. Such paradoxical 
change was also observed in specific groups of bacteria during GC occurrence and 
its progression. GC risk-related microbiome was associated with differentiated 
GC, severe intestinal metaplasia, associated DNA methylation and telomere 
shortening, while GC tissue-specific microbiome was associated with more 
aggressive features of GC and TP53 mutation status.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggested the different role of non-Helicobacter 
pylori microbiota in GC initiation and progression steps.

BACKGROUND: Endometrial clear cell carcinoma (ECCC) is a rare and highly 
aggressive histological subtype of endometrial cancer with marked metastatic 
potential. The molecular characteristics and underlying mechanisms governing its 
metastatic behaviour remain poorly understood. This study aimed to delineate 
molecular distinctions between metastatic (Pm) and non-metastatic (Pn) primary 
ECCC tumours, elucidate DNA methylation-mediated regulatory mechanisms driving 
metastasis, and identify potential epigenetic biomarkers and therapeutic 
targets.
METHODS: This multicentre study involved 51 individuals diagnosed with ECCC, 
leading to the establishment of two independent cohorts: a sequencing cohort (n 
= 35) for integrated whole-genome methylation and transcriptomic analysis, and a 
tissue microarray (TMA) cohort (n = 16) to validate key findings.
FINDINGS: Tumours exhibiting metastasis were found to possess a profoundly 
immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment (TME), evidenced by reduced density of 
tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), especially within subsets of anti-tumour 
immune cells. Further analysis highlighted differential hypermethylation events 
in Pm tumours that acted as crucial epigenetic switches regulating immune 
responses. Specifically, methylation at ETS1-binding sites influenced ETS1 
regulon activity, thus broadly regulating immune response processes. Epigenetic 
silencing of key genes in the T cell receptor (TCR) signalling pathway, such as 
LCK, CD3E, and ZAP70, impaired T cell activation and inhibited the activity of 
interacting immune pathways. Additionally, we developed a Lasso-derived 
metastatic risk score model, incorporating TME features (TIL density) and 
epigenetic predictors (LCK methylation), which demonstrated strong predictive 
performance (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.859).
INTERPRETATION: This study illuminated the ""epigenetic-immune axis"" as a central 
regulatory mechanism driving ECCC metastasis. DNA methylation systematically 
silenced immune response genes by targeting ETS1-binding sites and TCR 
signalling components, thus reconstructing the immunosuppressive TME to 
facilitate metastasis. The development of the metastatic risk score model and 
identification of LCK as a potential therapeutic target provide valuable 
strategies for precision treatment decisions and advancing targeted 
epigenetic-immune therapies in ECCC.

Aging is a complex biological process, and some individuals are aging faster or 
slower than expected. This phenomenon of aging acceleration occurs when 
biological age exceeds chronological age and can be assessed by epigenetic clock 
estimation. As aging acceleration is known to occur in response to some 
environmental exposures as well as trauma, we hypothesized that World Trade 
Center (WTC) exposures may have led to epigenetic aging acceleration. 
WTC-exposed women were selected from the World Trade Center Environmental Health 
Center (WTC EHC) clinic, with peripheral blood collected during routine clinical 
monitoring visits. The reference group was selected from the NYU Women's Health 
Study (NYUWHS), a prospective cohort study that collected blood samples before 
9/11/2001. Epigenomes of WTC-exposed vs. unexposed women were profiled using the 
Infinium MethylationEPIC array. DNA-based epigenetic aging was estimated using 
Hannum, Horvath, PhenoAge and GrimAge epigenetic clocks. Age acceleration was 
defined as the residual from regressing estimated epigenetic age on 
chronological age. Ordinary least squares regression was used to investigate the 
relationship between WTC exposure and accelerated aging. After adjustment for 
race/ethnicity, smoking status, Body Mass Index (BMI), batch and cell type 
composition, WTC exposure was associated with epigenetic aging acceleration 
using the Hannum epigenetic clock (βWTC Exposed vs. Unexposed: 3.789; p-value: 
<0.001). WTC exposure was also associated with epigenetic aging acceleration 
when using other epigenetic clock types (Horvath and PhenoAge, but not GrimAge), 
and when stratifying by breast cancer case (βWTC Exposed vs. Unexposed: 3.473; 
p-value: <0.001) or cancer-free participant (βWTC Exposed vs. Unexposed: 4.369; 
p-value: 0.001) status. Among all participants, having a breast cancer diagnosis 
was statistically significantly associated with accelerated aging (βCancer vs. 
cancer-free: 1.658; p-value: 0.021). WTC exposure is statistically significantly 
associated with epigenetic aging acceleration. This was true even after 
stratifying on cancer status. WTC exposure was positively associated with 
epigenetic aging acceleration in the overall cohort, among only those women who 
were cancer-free, and among breast cancer cases.

Arsenic, a common environmental pollutant, causes skin damage with long-term 
exposure. Although its pathogenic mechanism remains unclear, skin cell 
senescence creates a microenvironment that promotes cancer development, with the 
mechanisms accelerating disease progression in arsenic-induced skin damage 
attracting significant attention. This study utilised previously collected skin 
samples to evaluate the associations between skin senescence and damage 
indicators. According to the presence or absence of arsenic exposure, 
participants were divided into a reference group and an arsenic exposure group. 
Additionally, the arsenic exposure group was further divided into a common 
pathological changes group, a hyperkeratosis group, and a skin cancer group, 
based on skin histopathological examination. Compared with the reference group, 
the arsenic exposure group exhibited increased expression of 
senescence-associated secretory phenotypes (IL-6 and IL-17) and shortened 
relative telomere length (RTL). With increasing severity of skin damage, IL-6 
and IL-17 levels progressively increased, while RTL progressively decreased. 
Examination of representative indicators of arsenic-induced skin damage 
(epithelial-mesenchymal transition [EMT] indicators) revealed decreased 
E-cadherin expression and increased vimentin expression. With increasing 
severity of skin damage, E-cadherin expression progressively decreased, while 
vimentin expression progressively increased. Moreover, clear correlations were 
observed between senescence-related markers (IL-6, IL-17, and RTL) and 
arsenic-induced skin damage markers (E-cadherin, vimentin) in the human samples. 
In vitro experiments demonstrated that arsenic induced lower expression of the 
telomere-related gene PARP1, reducing its binding to TERF2 and weakening its 
recruitment of BLM, thereby causing telomere dysfunction, promoting the 
senescence of HaCaT cells, and resulting in EMT. Additionally, arsenic exposure 
induced high expression of DNMT3, which mediated PARP1 hypermethylation and low 
expression. Treatment with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 
5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine restored PARP1 expression in arsenic-treated HaCaT cells, 
regulated telomere dysfunction, improved cellular senescence, and alleviated 
EMT. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying 
arsenic-induced skin damage from an epigenetic and genetic perspective.

The function of the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (referred hereafter 
as TERT) in the synthesis and maintenance of chromosome ends, or telomeres, is 
widely understood. Whether and how telomeres, on the other hand, influence TERT 
regulation is relatively less studied. We found TERT was transcriptionally 
altered depending on telomere length (TL). This resulted from TL-dependent 
binding of TRF2 between telomeres and the TERT promoter. TERT promoter-bound 
TRF2 was non-telomeric and did not involve the looping of telomeres to the TERT 
promoter. Cell lines from different tissue types fibrosarcoma (HT1080), colon 
cancer (HCT116), and breast cancer (MDA-MB-231), engineered for either telomere 
elongation/shortening, gave an increase/decrease in TERT, respectively. 
Mechanistically, we show TERT promoter-bound non-telomeric TRF2 recruits the 
canonical PRC2-complex, inducing repressor histone H3K27-trimethylation in a 
TL-dependent fashion. This was further supported by TL-dependent promoter 
activity from an exogenously inserted TERT reporter. Increase in TL over days 
followed by a gradual decline, resulted in activation followed by repression of 
TERT in a concerted manner, further implicating TL as a key factor for TERT 
regulation. Notably, on reprogramming primary fibroblasts to induced pluripotent 
stem cells (iPSCs), TRF2 loss from the TERT promoter was evident along with 
telomere elongation and TERT upregulation. Conversely, on telomere shortening in 
iPSCs, TERT promoter-bound TRF2 was restored with a marked reduction in TERT, 
further supporting the causal role of TL in TERT transcription. Mechanisms of 
tight control of TERT by TL shown here are likely to have major implications in 
telomere-related physiologies, particularly, cancer, ageing, and pluripotency.

Plain Language Summary: Human cells typically have 23 pairs of structures known 
as chromosomes, each containing a unique set of genes that provides the 
instructions needed to make proteins and other essential molecules found in the 
body. At the end of each chromosome lies a region of repetitive DNA sequences, 
known as the telomere, which protects the chromosome strands from damage or 
tangling. Every time a cell divides, some of the telomere repeats are cut off, 
causing the telomeres to shorten. Specific enzymes known as telomerases can add 
these repeats back on so that the telomeres do not become too short. As we age, 
telomeres naturally shorten in length, but certain lifestyle factors can 
accelerate this process, leading to programmed cell death and contributing to 
various diseases, including cancers. In 2018, researchers showed that TRF2, a 
key telomere protein, helps relay information about telomere length to various 
regulatory genes. However, it remained unclear whether TRF2 could directly 
communicate this information to the telomerase itself. Sengupta et al. – 
including several of the researchers from the 2018 study – set out to answer 
this question by studying multiple human cancer cell lines with different 
telomere lengths. They discovered that TRF2 acts like a messenger that interacts 
with the telomerase gene TERT, in a length-dependent manner. When telomeres were 
long, most TRF2 remained bound at the telomeres and did not interact with TERT, 
allowing continued telomerase activity and telomere elongation. By contrast, 
when telomeres were short, TRF2 was released from the telomeres and bound 
directly to the TERT promoter. There, together with a DNA structure called the 
G-quadruplex, TRF2 suppressed TERT expression and thereby limited further 
telomere extension. In other words, shortened telomeres repressed TERT 
expression, while elongated ones increased it. In this positive feedback–like 
reinforcement system, telomere length is signaled by the amount of free TRF2 
protein. When TERT expression is high and telomeres are long, less TRF2 is 
available to bind the TERT promoter, reducing repression and thereby maintaining 
its expression. Conversely, when TERT expression is low and telomeres are short, 
more TRF2 is available, reinforcing repression and sustaining the low-expression 
state. Regulating telomere length is essential for healthy cell function, and 
its dysregulation is a hallmark of cancer. Sengupta et al. demonstrated that 
TRF2 plays a critical role in this process by feeding back information about 
telomere length directly to the TERT gene. By further dissecting this feedback 
system and refining experimental tools, researchers may gain new insights into 
telomere regulation in cancer and related diseases.

We identified new diagnostic markers for ovarian cancer based on the analysis of 
aberrant methylation in a group of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) genes. Using 
quantitative methyl-specific PCR with the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test, a 
significant (p < 0.01) increase in the methylation levels of three lncRNA genes 
(KCNK15-AS1, MAGI2-AS3, SSTR5-AS1) was demonstrated in a representative cohort 
of 56 clinical ovarian cancer samples. Using quantitative reverse transcription 
PCR on the same sample set, a significant decrease in the expression of these 
three lncRNA genes (p < 0.01) and a statistically significant inverse 
correlation between changes in methylation and expression levels (r < -0.5) were 
demonstrated, which confirms the functional role of methylation in suppressing 
their expression in tumor tissues. ROC analysis was used to assess the 
diagnostic potential of these genes. It was shown that the detection of 
methylation in at least one of the three genes in tissue DNA samples allows for 
identification of ovarian cancer with 98% sensitivity and 100% specificity (test 
> 0, AUC = 0.989). The developed marker panel may be of interest for the 
molecular assessment of at-risk patients when determining a preliminary 
diagnosis. However, the method requires validation on a larger, more 
representative sample set.

Insights into variation in monocyte context-specific splicing and transcript 
usage are limited. Here, we perform paired gene and transcript QTL mapping 
across distinct immune states using RNA sequencing data of monocytes isolated 
from a cohort of 185 healthy Europeans incubated alone or in the presence of 
interferon gamma (IFN-γ) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We identify regulatory 
variants for 5749 genes and 8727 transcripts, with 291 context-specific 
transcript QTL colocalizing with GWAS loci. Notable disease relevant 
associations include IFN-γ specific transcript QTL at COVID-19 severity locus 
rs10735079, where allelic variation modulates context-specific splicing of OAS1, 
and at rs4072037, a risk allele for gastro-esophageal cancer, which associates 
with context-specific splicing of MUC1. We use DNA methylation data from the 
same cells to demonstrate overlap between methylation QTL and causal 
context-specific expression QTL, permitting inference of the direction of 
effect. Finally, we identify a subset of expression QTL that uncouple genes from 
proximally acting regulatory networks, creating 'co-expression QTL' with 
different allele-specific correlation networks. Our findings highlight the 
interplay between context and genetics in the regulation of the monocyte gene 
expression and splicing, revealing putative mechanisms of diverse disease risk 
alleles including for COVID-19 and cancer.

Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), a potent dietary carcinogen, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), 
an oncogenic virus, are both implicated in cancer development, particularly in 
endemic regions. However, the combined effects of AFB1 exposure and EBV 
infection on the epigenetic landscape remain poorly understood. This study 
investigates the impact of AFB1 and EBV on histone post-translational 
modifications (hPTMs) in Burkitt lymphoma (BL) cells through an integrative 
approach combining untargeted mass spectrometry-based profiling and a time-lapse 
experimental design. Our results reveal subtle, yet reproducible and dynamic 
alterations in histone methylation and acetylation patterns over time in all 
cells. Specifically, AFB1 exposure induced an increase in H3K27me3 levels, which 
in the case of EBV infected cells, counteracts the decrease observed at baseline 
compared to uninfected cells. Additionally, changes in acetylation patterns of 
H4 N-tail residues and key regulatory proteins suggest potential disruptions in 
chromatin accessibility and transcriptional regulation. Our correlation and 
network-based analyses further highlight coordinated epigenetic shifts in 
response to AFB1, with key acetylation hubs emerging within the histone PTM 
profile. Despite subtle differences, no significant divergence in overall hPTM 
responses was detected between EBV-infected and uninfected cells, emphasizing 
the subtlety of the EBV effect on AFB1 exposure. Future research should explore 
locus-specific epigenetic changes and therapeutic interventions targeting hPTMs 
to mitigate cancer risk associated with AFB1 exposure and EBV infection.

BACKGROUND: Ovarian cancer remains the deadliest gynecological malignancy with 
5-year survival rates below 40% due to frequent recurrence and chemoresistance. 
Aberrant crotonylation, a type of epigenetic modification, has been implicated 
in the proliferation, metastasis, and immune evasion of various cancers. 
However, its role in the ovarian cancer microenvironment and clinical outcomes 
remains unexplored. The aim of this study was to develop a prognostic model for 
ovarian cancer on the basis of crotonylation and to investigate the underlying 
mechanisms and potential of crotonylation for targeted therapy.
METHODS: We systematically analyzed single-cell RNA-seq and bulk transcriptomic 
datasets from ovarian cancer patients. Cellular crotonylation activity was 
quantified using AUCell algorithm. Potential prognostic genes were identified 
through DEG analysis and Weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA), and 
the associated molecular mechanisms were elucidated via Gene set enrichment 
analysis (GSEA). An ovarian cancer prognosis model were constructed by 
integrating machine learning algorithms. Immune microenvironment features were 
assessed using CIBERSORT, ESTIMATE and TIDE algorithms, with drug sensitivity 
predicted via genomics of drug sensitivity in cancer.
RESULTS: The ovarian cancer microenvironment is characterized by abundant immune 
cell infiltration, with significant differences in crotonylation levels among 7 
cell subtypes. We identified 451 key crotonylation-related genes. The 
crotonylation risk score (RS) model demonstrated robust prognostic performance. 
High-RS groups showed immunosuppressive characteristics: decreased follicular 
helper T cells and activated NK cells, concomitant with M2 macrophage 
enrichment. Elevated RS was associated with increased stromal activation, as 
indicated by a higher ESTIMATE score, and enhanced immune evasion potential, 
reflected by an elevated TIDE score. Notably, high-RS patients exhibited 
upregulated PDL1 and CD40, suggesting increased immunotherapy susceptibility. 
Pharmacogenomic analysis identified vinblastine with differential sensitivity, 
providing actionable targets for RS-stratified therapy.
CONCLUSION: We elucidated the significant impact of crotonylation on the ovarian 
cancer microenvironment and prognosis. We developed and validated a novel 
prognostic model for ovarian cancer that can serve as a tool for predicting 
patient outcomes and characterizing the immune microenvironment. These findings 
enhance our understanding of the role of crotonylation in ovarian cancer and 
establish a robust framework for developing therapeutic strategies targeting 
crotonylation.

INTRODUCTION: Heredity and epigenetic factors contribute to the pathogenesis of 
neutrophil-cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV). Cytotoxic T 
lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), an inhibitory receptor regulating 
T-cell homeostasis and maintaining self-tolerance, has emerged as a key target 
for immune screening and therapeutics in autoimmunity and cancer. CTLA-4 is 
associated with various autoimmune diseases; however, the relationship between 
CTLA-4 polymorphisms and AAV in the Guangxi population of China remains 
underexplored. In the present case-control study, we evaluated the effects of 
CTLA-4 polymorphisms on AAV susceptibility in the Guangxi population of China.
METHODS: A total of 343 patients with AAV and 343 healthy controls were 
recruited. High-throughput sequencing was used to genotype CTLA4 variants, and 
logistic regression analysis was used to assess their association with AAV risk. 
The relationship between the haplotypes of CTLA4 single-nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs) and AAV risk was assessed using the SHEsis platform.
RESULTS: Three CTLA4 SNPs- rs62182595, rs16840252, and rs5742909- showed 
significant association with AAV susceptibility. The ATT and GCC haplotypes, 
comprising these loci, were also associated with an increased risk of AAV.
DISCUSSION: These findings suggest that CTLA4 polymorphisms (rs62182595, 
rs16840252, and rs5742909) may contribute to AAV susceptibility in the Guangxi 
population and offer preliminary markers for risk assessment, early diagnosis, 
and personalized management of AAV.

Objective. To improve survival prediction for HER2-positive breast cancer by 
integrating histopathological, molecular, and clinical data using a multimodal 
transformer framework.Approach. We propose a multimodal transformer framework 
for breast cancer survival prediction using HER2 stratified (SurvMBC), a 
foundation model-enhanced architecture that fuses three data modalities: 
whole-slide images, clinical narratives, and molecular features. Tumor 
microenvironment features are extracted using a pathology language and image 
pre-training (PLIP), clinical narratives are processed with BioBERT, and miRNA 
expression plus DNA methylation data are embedded using Gen2Vec. These 
representations are integrated through a cross-modal transformer with attention 
mechanisms for survival prediction.Main results. The model was evaluated on 
1,095 HER2-positive breast cancer patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas. SurvMBC 
achieved a concordance index (C-index) of 0.857 (95% CI: 0.834, 0.880), a low 
integrated Brier score, and a strong inverse negative binomial log-likelihood. 
Risk stratification based on model outputs significantly separated high- and 
low-risk groups (log-rankp< 0.01) and showed strong associations with tumor 
stage, grade, and hormone receptor status (allp< 0.05).Significance. SurvMBC 
demonstrates the effectiveness of multimodal fusion in addressing tumor 
heterogeneity and improving prognostic accuracy. The attention-based integration 
enables context-aware learning of survival-relevant features across modalities, 
supporting individualized risk stratification and risk-adaptive treatment 
planning for HER2 stratified breast cancer patients.

BACKGROUND: French and International anal cancer screening recommendations for 
at-risk populations, published in 2024, are based on cytology and/or high-risk 
human papillomavirus (HPV) detection on anal smears. Biological markers to 
triage the patients most at-risk for anal cancer are crucial in prioritising 
patients needing high-resolution anoscopy consultations, which are frequently 
overwhelmed.
METHODS: The AIN3 cohort is a French national multicenter study including 
patients with a history of high-grade anal lesions (AIN3). Patients were 
followed-up for at least 3 years, with anal smears and clinical examinations 
performed yearly. Levels of ZNF582 and ASCL1 gene methylation were quantified 
using real-time PCR on anal smears collected at the time of inclusion.
FINDINGS: Overall, 514 anal smears were contributive for host-cell DNA 
methylation analysis. Patients' mean age was 50.8 years and 40% were women. 
Among the 41% who were living with HIV, 91% were men. Median follow-up duration 
was 48 months, and 22 patients (4%) developed anal cancer during follow-up. 
Higher methylation levels of ZNF582 and ASCL1 were significantly associated with 
high-grade squamous cell intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) cytology, p16-Ki67 
dual-staining positivity, and high-risk HPV and HPV16 positivity on the same 
anal smear. Both methylation markers showed an AUC of 0.72 for discrimination 
between HSIL and non-HSIL cytology on the same anal smear. Higher methylation 
levels of both markers were significantly associated with evolution to anal 
cancer in univariate and multivariable analyses adjusted for age and HIV status 
(p < 0.001). When assessing the AUC over 1 and 3 years of follow-up, methylation 
markers demonstrated superior predictive value for anal cancer compared to other 
markers.
INTERPRETATION: We have demonstrated the predictive value of host-cell DNA 
methylation marker levels in anal smears with regard to evolution to anal cancer 
in a very high-risk population.

BackgroundEuchromatic histone-lysine N-methyltransferase 2 (EHMT2), a 
neuroinflammatory histone methyltransferase, has been proposed as a therapeutic 
target for Alzheimer's disease (AD), potentially via modulation of gut 
microbiota. However, causality remains unclear due to confounding in 
observational studies and lack of human genetic evidence.ObjectiveTo address 
this, we conducted a Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using genome-wide 
association data exclusively from individuals of European ancestry.MethodsWe 
obtained genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics for EHMT2 
expression, AD (n = 39,106), 211 gut microbiota taxa, and colorectal cancer 
(CRC; n = 6847) from the IEU OpenGWAS and FinnGen databases. MR was used to 
evaluate the causal effects, with CRC as a positive control. Five regression 
models were utilized to evaluate the causal effects, and two-step MR assessed 
the mediating role of gut microbiota. Sensitivity analyses tested result 
robustness.ResultsInverse-variance weighted (IVW) analyses showed that EHMT2 
inhibition was associated with reduced risks of CRC [odds ratio (OR) = 0.7850, 
95% CI: 0.6782-0.9086, p = 0.0012], and AD (OR = 0.8585, 95% CI: 0.8056-0.9148, 
p < 0.0001). EHMT2 inhibition also influenced the abundance of 67 gut microbiota 
taxa. Among them, 17 taxa were linked to AD risk, with four showing shared 
causal associations. Notably, three of them (family Lactobacillaceae id.1836, 
genus Dialister id.2183, and unknown genus id.959) had positive mediating 
effects.ConclusionsEHMT2 inhibition may play protective roles in AD via 
modulating specific gut microbiota, particularly three key taxa. These findings 
highlight a potential microbiota-mediated epigenetic mechanism in AD 
pathogenesis, warranting further mechanistic and translational studies.

INTRODUCTION: Chronic caregiving stress accelerates biological aging, reflecting 
disease risk and mortality; however, the underlying mechanisms are poorly 
understood. Epigenetic clocks, which can be estimated from levels of DNA 
methylation in a subset of cytosine-phosphate-guanine loci in the genome, have 
been proposed as a promising biological age estimator. The objectives of this 
scoping review are to systematically scope the literature on the effects of 
stress on biological ageing measured by epigenetic clocks in family caregivers 
of patients diagnosed with cancer.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This review will be conducted following Joanna Briggs 
Institute methodology based on Arksey and O'Malley's and Levac et al's framework 
and reported using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for scoping reviews. Studies will be included 
if (1) the studies focus on unpaid family caregivers of patients diagnosed with 
cancer; (2) caregivers are adults (≥18 years of age) and (3) the study measured 
epigenetic clocks. The search will encompass literature and peer-reviewed 
literature in PubMed/MEDLINE (National Library of Medicine), Embase (Elsevier), 
Cochrane CENTRAL (Wiley & Sons), Web of Science: Core Collection (Clarivate 
Analytics), CINAHL (EBSCOhost) and PsycInfo (American Psychological 
Association).
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Since the scoping review methodology focuses on 
published literature, this study does not require ethical approval. We will 
publish our findings in a peer-reviewed journal and plan to disseminate our work 
in conferences and scientific meetings.

The cellular plasticity of neuroblastoma is defined by a mixture of two major 
cell states, adrenergic and mesenchymal, which may contribute to therapy 
resistance. However, how neuroblastoma cells switch cellular states during 
therapy remains largely unknown, and how to eradicate neuroblastoma regardless 
of its cell state is a clinical challenge. To better understand the cellular 
plasticity of neuroblastoma in chemoresistance, we define the transcriptomic and 
epigenetic map of adrenergic and mesenchymal types of neuroblastomas using human 
and murine models treated with indisulam, a selective RBM39 degrader. We show 
that cancer cells not only undergo a bidirectional switch between adrenergic and 
mesenchymal states, but also acquire additional cellular states, reminiscent of 
the developmental pliancy of neural crest cells. These cell state alterations 
are coupled with epigenetic reprogramming and dependency switching of cell 
state-specific transcription factors, epigenetic modifiers, and targetable 
kinases. Through targeting RNA splicing, indisulam induces an inflammatory tumor 
microenvironment and enhances the anticancer activity of natural killer cells. 
The combination of indisulam with anti-GD2 immunotherapy results in a durable, 
complete response in high-risk transgenic neuroblastoma models, providing an 
innovative, rational therapeutic approach to eradicate tumor cells regardless of 
their potential to switch cell states.

Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) is the primary type of liver malignancy, which 
stands as the third leading contributor to cancer-related death worldwide. Its 
development is associated with multifactors, which include viral hepatitis, 
metabolic syndrome, lifestyle factors, and dysregulation of many genetic and 
epigenetic signalling pathways. MicroRNAs play the main role in gene regulation 
in eukaryotic cells, which functions primarily through RISC, and their 
dysregulations with enhanced expression of RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) 
activity contribute to HCC pathogenesis. Staphylococcal nuclease 
domain-containing protein 1 (SND1), a core component of the RISC machinery, acts 
as an oncogene promoting tumor growth, invasion, and angiogenesis in HCC. 
Furthermore, aberrant telomerase activation, largely attributed to elevated 
expression of its catalytic subunit of human telomerase reverse transcriptase 
(hTERT), is a hallmark of approximately 90 % of cancers. Short-chain fatty acid 
(SCFA), Sodium Butyrate (NaBu), are gut microbiota-derived metabolites with 
emerging anti-cancer properties. NaBu acts as an HDAC inhibitor, exhibiting 
anti-proliferative, pro-apoptotic, and anti-inflammatory effects in various 
cancer models. In this study, we investigate the novel molecular mechanism by 
which NaBu regulates SND1 meditated hTERT expression in HCC and assess its 
anti-tumor efficacy through in-vitro cellular models.

Colon cancer remains a major cause of global cancer mortality, characterized by 
complex interactions between genetic, epigenetic, and immune factors. This study 
investigates the prognostic value of efferocytosis-related genes and their role 
in colon cancer progression and immune modulation. A prognostic signature relied 
on efferocytosis-related genes was developed using univariate Cox and least 
absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analyses. Immune 
infiltration, immune checkpoint expression, and tumor microenvironment 
characteristics were analyzed using single-sample gene set enrichment analysis 
(ssGSEA), ESTIMATE, and tumor immunophenotype (TIP) frameworks. S1PR5 was 
knocked down in SW1116 and SW620 cells. The effect of S1PR5 on colon cancer 
growth and macrophage regulation in vivo and in vitro. Colon cancer patients 
were stratified into high- and low-risk groups, with high-risk patients 
demonstrating significantly worse survival outcomes. S1PR5, a key gene in the 
model, was markedly overexpressed in colon cancer tumors and correlated with 
advanced clinical stages, poor survival outcomes, and diminished responses to 
immunotherapy. Furthermore, S1PR5 knockdown could inhibit colon cancer cell 
activity and increase macrophage polarization from M0 to M1. Our research 
developed an efferocytosis-related gene prognostic model and identified S1PR5 as 
a key biomarker. S1PR5 showed significant associations with advanced clinical 
stages, immunosuppressive microenvironments, and unfavorable survival outcomes, 
underscoring its potential as both a prognostic marker and a therapeutic target 
in colon cancer.

Cell-free DNA (cfDNA), shed by malignant tumor cells into extracellular fluid, 
provides valuable epigenetic information indicative of cancer status. Nipple 
aspirate fluid (NAF), a noninvasive liquid biopsy from at-risk women, contains 
nucleic acid and protein biomarkers from adjacent cancer cells, showing promise 
for breast cancer (BrC) detection. However, despite its potential, the 
application of cfDNA in NAF for BrC screening is still underexplored. Here, we 
report a proof-of-concept study for using cfDNA bisulfite sequencing (cfBS) to 
assess tumor DNA methylation signatures from NAF samples. For four healthy 
individuals and three BrC patients, cfBS achieved greater than 20× sequencing 
depth with an average coverage of 26.5× on the genome. A total of 7471 
differentially methylated regions were identified, with significant 
hypermethylation in BrC samples compared to healthy controls. Gene set 
enrichment analysis indicated that the differentially methylated genes (DMGs) 
were significantly associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). By 
developing a novel EMT scoring metric, we found that BrC samples had more of a 
mesenchymal phenotype than samples from healthy individuals. CDH1, WNT2, and 
TRIM29 were hypermethylated near the promoter region, while COL5A2 was 
hypermethylated in the coding region. The DNA methylation and EMT changes were 
validated through The Cancer Genome Atlas Breast Invasive Carcinoma study, which 
confirmed that DMGs were associated with gene expression change and that our 
methylation-based EMT score reliably distinguished tumors from healthy controls. 
Our findings support the utilization of the NAF cfDNA cfBS methylation profile 
for noninvasive BrC screening and pave the way for enhanced early detection of 
this disease.

Our study aims to systematically investigate the potential carcinogenic 
mechanisms of bisphenol A (BPA) in three gastrointestinal tumors: intrahepatic 
cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), colorectal cancer (CRC), and esophageal cancer. By 
systematically integrating multi-omics databases, including transcriptomics and 
single-cell transcriptomics, we identified overlapping targets between 
BPA-associated molecules and tumor-related genes. Functional enrichment revealed 
that these targets converge on key oncogenic pathways, includingcellular 
metabolic reprogramming (particularly glycolysis), tumor microenvironment 
remodeling via cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) activation, and dysregulation 
of cell cycle progression. Molecular docking verified strong binding affinity 
between BPA and key targets. Survival analysis linked GAPDH and HSP90AA1 in ICC, 
CDKN1A, CEBPB, and EGR1 in CRC, and DCN and CXCL12 in esophageal cancer to poor 
survival rates, highlighting their potential as prognostic biomarkers. Our 
findings demonstrate that BPA promotes gastrointestinal carcinogenesisthrough 
disrupting energy metabolism, activating CAFs to remodel the tumor 
microenvironment, and enhancing cancer cell proliferation. This multi-level 
evidence advances the risk assessment of BPA and identifies potential targets 
for prevention and therapy of BPA-linked gastrointestinal cancers. Environmental 
Implication. In addition to well-documented role in promoting endocrine-related 
diseases, the mechanisms by which hazardous compound bisphenol A (BPA) 
contributes to other pathological conditions must not be overlooked. Through 
systematic integration of biological evidence chains, this study revealed BPA's 
triple carcinogenic mechanism involving interference with cell cycle 
checkpoints, remodeling of tumor microenvironment stroma, and disruption of 
epigenetic regulation, thereby providing a novel target system for preventing 
environmental toxicant-induced gastrointestinal tumors.

BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease with high morbidity 
and mortality rates. Despite the availability of various treatments, a 
significant number of patients still face a high probability of recurrence or 
metastasis, which severely impacts their survival status. Traditional prognostic 
methods based on single-modality data and machine learning algorithms often fail 
to adequately capture the complex biological relationships and heterogeneous 
characteristics of breast cancer, leading to suboptimal prognostic performance. 
Therefore, there is an urgent need for a more accurate and effective method to 
predict the risk of recurrence and metastasis in breast cancer prognosis.
METHODS: In this study, we propose a novel method termed PCGMMF for breast 
cancer prognostic analysis. This method integrates histopathological images, 
clinical data, gene expression data, and DNA methylation data through multimodal 
fusion. We leverage a pre-trained Vision-LSTM model based on transfer learning 
to extract features from histopathological images. Additionally, we design a 
comprehensive feature selection strategy that includes support vector machine 
(SVM), Mantel test, and correlation analysis to filter features from gene 
expression data and DNA methylation data. Furthermore, to address the high 
heterogeneity of breast cancer and the independence and intersectionality of 
multimodal features, we propose a bidirectional attention and self-attention 
based enhanced multimodal feature fusion module called BSAMF.
RESULTS: Through a series of experiments, we evaluate the performance of PCGMMF. 
When predicting the recurrence and metastasis risk of breast cancer prognosis, 
PCGMMF achieves an accuracy of 0.903 and an AUC value of 0.924, outperforming 
other state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we provide an interpretability 
analysis of highly significant regions from histopathological images, which can 
serve as a reference for clinical practice.
CONCLUSION: PCGMMF offers a robust and innovative solution for breast cancer 
prognostic analysis by effectively integrating multimodal data and utilizing 
advanced deep learning techniques. It can effectively conduct breast cancer

INTRODUCTION: Epigenetic changes are important modulators of gene expression. 
The histone acetyltransferase gene non-derepressible 5 (Gcn5) is emerging as a 
pivotal epigenetic player in metabolism and cancer, yet its role in obesity and 
cardiovascular disease remains elusive.
AIMS: To investigate Gcn5 role in obesity-related endothelial dysfunction.
METHODS: Human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) were exposed to vehicle or 
palmitic acid (200 uM) in the presence or in the absence of the Gcn5 
pharmacological inhibitor CPTH2 or gene silencing. Ex-vivo inhibition of Gcn5 
was performed in aortic rings from diet-induced obese and control mice. 
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed to investigate the epigenetic 
regulation of Nox2 promoter. In parallel, Gcn5/Nox2 expression was assessed by 
real-time PCR in vascular specimens isolated from obese patients and age-matched 
healthy controls. Endothelial-dependent vasodilation was also assessed in human 
vessels.
RESULTS: PA increased Gcn5 gene expression in HAECs. Gcn5 upregulation was 
associated with increased expression of the pro-oxidant enzyme Nox2. 
Interestingly, either Gcn5 inhibition or gene silencing prevented PA-induced 
Nox2 upregulation and oxidative stress accumulation. ChiP assay showed increased 
Gcn5 occupancy and enhanced histone 3 acetylation of lysine 14 (H3K14ac) on Nox2 
promoter. In aortic rings from obese mice, pharmacological inhibition of Gcn5 by 
CPTH2 rescued endothelial-dependent vasorelaxation as compared to vehicle. 
Finally, Gcn5 was increased in vessels from obese patients and correlated with 
Nox2 expression and endothelial dysfunction.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings shed light on the importance of epigenetic regulation 
in obesity and pinpoint Gcn5 as a therapeutic target to prevent endothelial 
dysfunction in cardiometabolic disease.

BACKGROUND: Intestinal flora, or gut microbiota, has increasingly been 
recognized for its potential role in cancer development and progression. Beyond 
direct interactions with systemic organs, gut microbiota and its metabolites can 
modulate epigenetic processes such as DNA methylation, histone modification, and 
non-coding RNA regulation. This study aims to bridge this gap by conducting a 
bibliometric and visualization analysis of the scientific literature on cancer 
associated with intestinal flora.
METHODS: We utilized bibliometric software to examine publication trends, 
citation patterns, and collaborative networks within the field. Visualization 
techniques were applied to pinpoint influential authors, institutions, and 
countries. The analysis encompassed a comprehensive search of relevant databases 
to gather data on publications related to intestinal flora and cancer.
RESULTS: Our findings indicate a substantial rise in publications over recent 
decades, signifying an intensifying focus on the intestinal flora-cancer 
connection. Key research hotspots identified include the microbiota's role in 
colorectal cancer, the interplay between microbiota and the host immune system, 
the epigenetic impacts of gut microbiota on cancer development, and the promise 
of microbiota-targeted therapies for cancer treatment. The analysis also 
revealed a network of prominent researchers, leading institutions, and countries 
at the forefront of this research area.
CONCLUSIONS: This study offers a panoramic view of the current research on 
cancer associated with intestinal flora and underscores potential avenues for 
future exploration. The insights gleaned from our bibliometric and visualization 
analysis may guide the development of targeted strategies for cancer prevention 
and treatment, harnessing the power of the gut microbiota.

BACKGROUND: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most prevalent and fatal 
cancer affecting women worldwide. The SWI/SNF complexes exhibit the ability to 
selectively replace subunits, thereby enabling a wide range of epigenetic 
functions. As an accessory subunit of this complex, ARID1B is critically 
involved in modulating chromatin accessibility and transcriptional regulation. 
Nevertheless, its precise contribution to TNBC pathogenesis remains poorly 
understood.
METHODS: ARID1B expression levels in TNBC were detected using immunofluorescence 
and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). To investigate 
ARID1B's biological functions in TNBC, a series of in vitro assays were 
conducted, complemented by subcutaneous tumor xenograft models. Mass 
spectrometry analysis was employed to identify ARID1B-interacting proteins, 
while RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed to screen downstream target genes 
regulated by ARID1B. The transcriptional regulatory mechanism of ZNF382 mediated 
by ARID1B was further validated through dual-luciferase reporter assays and 
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR. To determine if ZNF382 knockdown 
could reverse the cellular effects of ARID1B, SMARCC2, and SMARCB1 inhibition, 
functional rescue experiments were conducted.
RESULTS: We identified ARID1B as a notable E3 ubiquitin ligase gene associated 
with breast cancer prognosis, particularly serving as a risk prognostic factor 
in TNBC. Contrary to its previously reported function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, 
we observed that ARID1B transcriptionally represses ZNF382 by forming a novel 
SWI/SNF complex with SMARCC2 and SMARCB1. This newly assembled complex promotes 
TNBC proliferation and migration, highlighting a previously unrecognized 
mechanism of ARID1B in cancer development.
CONCLUSIONS: This research enhances the understanding of the intricate roles 
played by SWI/SNF complex components in TNBC and bridges the gap between the 
structural specificity of SWI/SNF assembly and the progression of cancer. These 
findings could potentially unveil novel therapeutic targets for TNBC, thereby 
advancing the development of more efficacious treatment approaches for this 
highly aggressive malignancy.

One of the hallmarks of malignant neoplasms is their ability to sustain growth 
under hypoxic conditions resulting from insufficient oxygenation of tumor 
tissues. Prolonged hypoxia is associated with the gradual adaptation of tumor 
cells to low oxygen levels, leading to the enhanced survival, increased 
metastatic potential, and development of resistance to anticancer therapies. The 
aim of this study was to investigate the mechanisms underlying adaptation of 
breast cancer cell to prolonged hypoxia and maintenance of the hypoxia-tolerant 
phenotype. Using long-term culturing under low oxygen conditions (1% O2), we 
established hypoxia-adapted sublines of luminal (MCF-7) and triple-negative 
(MDA-MB-231) breast cancer cells, characterized by a stable growth in a hypoxic 
environment. The acquisition of hypoxia tolerance was accompanied by the 
activation of the HIF-1α-dependent transcription factor STAT3 and persistent 
overexpression of Snail, a key downstream effector of STAT3. The maintenance and 
stabilization of hypoxia-tolerant phenotype are mediated by miR-181a-2, which 
targets the STAT3/Snail signaling axis in the resistant cells. Analysis of DNA 
methylation status revealed no significant changes in the expression or activity 
of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) in the hypoxia-adapted cells. However, 
pharmacological inhibition of DNMTs using decitabine, as well as DNMT knockdown, 
increased cell sensitivity to hypoxia and partially reversed the 
hypoxia-resistant phenotype, which was accompanied by the activation of 
pro-apoptotic p53 signaling. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the 
acquired hypoxia tolerance in breast cancer cells is mediated, at least in part, 
by the activation of the miR-181a-2/STAT3/Snail signaling pathway. Furthermore, 
the use of demethylating agents may represent a promising therapeutic approach 
to targeting hypoxia-tolerant cancer cell populations.

Cancer remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide, arising from a complex 
interplay of genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors. Although the role 
of micronutrients in cancer development has received limited attention, growing 
evidence suggests that vitamins, particularly vitamin D, may influence oncogenic 
pathways. This hypothesis manuscript explores the potential interaction between 
vitamin D and the oncogenic long non-coding RNA HOTAIR, providing a novel 
mechanistic explanation for the inverse correlation between vitamin D status and 
cancer risk. We support our hypothesis with in silico docking evidence, 
suggesting that vitamin D binds to bioactive domains within the structured 
regions of HOTAIR, potentially disrupting its interaction with chromatin 
regulators such as PRC2. This concept may offer a novel approach to cancer 
prevention and therapy.

Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) confers high lifetime cancer risk due to germline 
TP53 pathogenic variants (PV). A comprehensive surveillance regimen termed the 
'Toronto Protocol', has been adopted for early tumor detection, demonstrating 
improved survival among TP53 PV carriers. However, the protocol's 
""one-size-fits-all"" approach fails to consider individual cancer risk. To 
personalize screening, we developed a support vector machine model to predict 
early onset of primary tumors (age < 6) using peripheral blood methylation data 
of TP53 PV carriers (n = 237). Validation (n = 64) and external testing (n = 79) 
showed AUROC = 0.928 [0.835-1.000], F1-score = 0.692 [0.435-0.867], and 
NPV = 0.984 [0.946-1.000]. The model achieved 91% accuracy, correctly 
classifying 90% of patients with cancer before the age of six and 87% of 
cancer-free individuals in the external test set. Our tool enables risk 
stratification for early-onset malignancies, to optimize clinical surveillance 
and improve patient outcomes.

Low-grade gliomas (LGGs) represent a complex and aggressive category of brain 
tumors. Despite recent advancements in molecular subtyping and characterization, 
the necessity to identify additional molecular subtypes and biomarkers remains. 
To delineate survival subtypes in LGG, we propose a deep learning (DL)-based 
multi-omics SurvivalNet (MOST) model. By integrating histological RNA-seq, 
miRNA-seq, and DNA methylation data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas 
(TCGA), we applied the MOST model to analyze data from 497 LGG patients. We 
employed consensus clustering to reveal heterogeneous subtypes, validated our 
findings using an internal validation set through a supervised classification 
algorithm, and further evaluated the robustness of our model in an independent 
external cohort. The DL-based MOST model identified two optimal patient subtypes 
with significant differences in survival (P = 3.07E - 16) and demonstrated a 
robust model fit (C = 0.92 ± 0.02). This multi-omics model was validated using 
external Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CCGA) datasets, including RNA-Seq 
(N = 497, C = 0.85), miRNA array (N = 89, C = 0.80), and DNA methylation 
(N = 89, C = 0.61). High-risk subcategories exhibited increased expression of 
the homeobox (HOX) family genes, regulation of cholesterol homeostasis, 
glycolysis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition pathway enrichment, and a high 
density of M2 macrophages. Our study utilized deep learning to identify 
multi-omics features associated with differential survival outcomes in patients 
with LGG. This work is anticipated to significantly enhance prognosis prediction 
for LGG due to its robustness within the cohorts.

INTRODUCTION: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is considered as a risk factor for kidney 
cancer (KC). However, so far, there is no study in the literature that has 
explored genetic factors through which T2D drive the development and progression 
of KC. Therefore, this study attempted to explore T2D- and KC-causing shared key 
genes (sKGs) for revealing shared pathogenesis and therapeutic drugs as their 
common treatments.
METHODS: The integrated bioinformatics and system biology approaches were 
utilized in this study. The statistical LIMMA approach was used based web-tool 
GEO2R to detect differentially expressed genes (DEGs) through transcriptomics 
analysis. Then upregulated and downregulated DEGs for T2D and KC were combined 
to obtained shared DEGs (sDEGs) between T2D and KC. The STRING database was used 
to construct the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of sDEGs. Then 
Cytohubba plugin-in Cytoscape were used in the PPI network to disclose the sKGs 
based on different topological measures. The RegNetwork database was used in 
NetworkAnalyst to analyze co-regulatory networks of sKGs with transcription 
factors (TFs) and micro-RNAs to identify key TFs and miRNAs as the 
transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulators of sKGs, respectively. 
AutoDock Vina is a tool used for molecular docking. ADME/T properties were 24 
assessed using pkCSM and SwissADME.
RESULTS: At first, 74 shared DEGs (sDEGs) were identified that can distinguish 
both KC and T2D patients from control samples. Through protein-protein 
interaction (PPI) network analysis, top-ranked 6 sDEGs (CD74, TFRC, CREB1, MCL1, 
SCARB1 and JUN) were detected as the sKGs that drive both KC and T2D development 
and progression. The most common sKG 'CD74' is associated with key pathways, 
such as NF-κB signaling transduction, apoptotic processes, B cell proliferation. 
Differential expression patterns of sKGs validated by independent datasets of 
NCBI database for T2D and TCGA and GTEx databases for KC. Furthermore, sKGs were 
found to be significant at several CpG sites in DNA methylation studies. 
Regulatory network analysis identified three TFs proteins (SMAD5, ATF1 and 
NR2F1) and two miRNAs (hsa-mir-1-3p and hsa-mir-34a-5p) as the regulators of 
sKGs. The enrichment analysis of sKGs with KEGG-pathways and Gene Ontology (GO) 
terms revealed some crucial shared pathogenetic mechanisms (sPM) between two 
diseases. Finally, sKGs-guided four potential therapeutic drug molecules 
(Imatinib, Pazopanib hydrochloride, Sorafenib and Glibenclamide) were 
recommended as the common therapies for KC with T2D.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study may be useful resources for the diagnosis 
and therapy of KC with the co-existence of T2D.

Mechanisms by which prior tuberculosis (TB) increases long-term risk for cancer, 
cardiovascular, and neurological disorders remain unclear, particularly in 
people with HIV (PWH). This study investigated DNA methylation (DNAm) patterns 
and associated pathways in PWH with and without prior TB infection. DNAm was 
analyzed in blood samples from 30 PWH (10 with prior latent TB infection [LTBI], 
10 with previous successfully treated active TB, and 10 with no TB) using the 
Illumina MethylationEPIC BeadChip covering over 850,000 CpG sites. Epigenetic 
age was estimated, and age acceleration was calculated. Differentially 
methylated CpGs (dmCpGs) and regions (DMRs) were identified, and functional 
enrichment analyses for Gene Ontology, KEGG pathways, PANTHER database, and gene 
set enrichment analysis (DisGeNET, dbGaP) were performed. Statistical 
significance was set at a false discovery rate (FDR) of < 0.05. PWH exhibited 
significant epigenetic age acceleration, with a mean of 19.32 ± 10.82 years 
greater than chronological age. This accelerated aging was more pronounced in 
individuals with any prior TB infection (21.60 ± 12.03 years) compared to those 
without TB (17.42 ± 9.38 years). In the prior active TB vs. no TB comparison, 
7461 dmCpGs were identified, corresponding to 150 DMRs (p < 0.05), with top 
associated genes including GRAMD1C (hypomethylation), DPP6 (hypermethylation), 
and HDAC4 (hypomethylation). In the LTBI vs. no TB comparison, 8598 dmCpGs were 
observed, corresponding to 39 DMRs (p < 0.05), associated with genes such as 
PLEKHG5 (hypermethylation), STK32C (hypermethylation), and SPATC1L. When 
comparing any prior TB (active or latent) to no TB, 71,774 dmCpGs and 14 DMRs 
were identified, including genes like PLEKHG5, KCNN3, and BRSK2. Pathway 
analyses of prior TB (active or latent) vs. no TB revealed enrichment in 
neurogenesis, neuron differentiation, axon guidance, and neuroactive ligand 
signaling. Additional enriched pathways included those related to platelet 
activation, vascular muscle contraction, and chemokine signaling. Cancer-related 
pathways such as proteoglycans in cancer, small cell lung cancer, prostate 
cancer, breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and thyroid cancer were also 
enriched. PANTHER analysis showed consistent enrichment in the Wnt signaling 
pathway and inflammation-mediated pathways across compared groups. DisGeNET 
analysis linked prior TB DNAm patterns to lymphoid leukemia, while dbGaP 
analysis identified associations with phenotypes like asthma, body mass index, 
tunica media, and lymphocyte count. Prior TB infection in PWH is associated with 
distinct DNAm changes in pathways related to neural function, cardiovascular 
health, and cancer risk, and is linked to more pronounced epigenetic age 
acceleration, suggesting epigenetic mechanisms for TB-related long-term 
complications.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality, 
with alcohol consumption implicated in its etiology. However, alcohol's 
prognostic impact on CRC survival is unclear, and self-reported intake is 
limited by bias. This population-based cohort study evaluated blood DNA 
methylation-based alcohol scores as objective prognostic tools in 2,129 CRC 
patients from Germany's DACHS study (2003-2021; median follow-up: 10 years). 
Participants were recruited from 22 hospitals in Southwest Germany, including 
non-metastatic (n = 1757) and metastatic (n = 372) patients with complete 
methylation and alcohol data. All three assessed methylation scores (3-CpG, 
450-CpG, 144-CpG) correlated with self-reported lifetime/recent alcohol intake 
(Spearman's r: 0.29-0.36; p < 0.0001), particularly recent consumption. In 
non-metastatic patients, self-reported alcohol consumption showed a J-shaped 
mortality risk, with elevated risks in heavy drinkers and abstainers. A similar 
dose-response pattern was observed for the 3-CpG methylation score, which showed 
consistent and robust associations with increased overall mortality (adjusted 
hazard ratio [aHR] per standard deviation increase: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.11-1.25), 
non-CRC-related mortality (1.22, 1.13-1.32), and CRC-specific mortality (1.12, 
1.00-1.25). The 450-CpG score was associated with overall mortality (1.07, 
1.00-1.15), non-CRC-related mortality (1.14, 1.05-1.23), and alcohol 
consumption-related mortality (1.59, 1.17-2.16). These findings highlight the 
potential utility of DNA methylation-based alcohol scores, especially the 3-CpG 
and the 450-CpG scores, as prognostic tools for CRC outcomes. Such biomarkers 
may provide a more objective measure of alcohol exposure and complement 
self-reported data in risk stratification and clinical decision-making, though 
further validation is warranted before clinical implementation.

Halobenzoquinones (HBQs), a class of emerging disinfection byproducts (DBPs) 
ubiquitously existed in drinking water, were predicted to be bladder 
carcinogens. HBQs exhibited a unique capacity to promote the conversion of 
5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). Thus, we propose that 
a varied epigenetic landscape may serve as an essential initial molecular event 
in cancer development under HBQs stress. We investigated the global levels of 
cytosine modifications and revealed genome-wide alteration of 5mC and 5hmC 
induced by HBQs in human bladder epithelial cells SV-HUC-1. The results showed 
that the global level of 5hmC significantly increased after exposure to HBQs. 
HBQ exposure resulted in more hypo-methylated (39,365) and 
hyper-hydroxymethylated (26,053) sites, with 7441 overlapping sites, suggesting 
the conversion of 5mC to 5hmC. The genes associated with hypo-differentially 
methylated regions (hypo-DMRs) and hyper-differentially hydroxymethylated 
regions (hyper-DhMRs) were enriched in cancer-related pathways, such as the 
Hippo signaling pathway, PI3K-AKT signaling pathway and Wnt signaling pathway. 
In particular, three bladder cancer-related genes (CASC8, TTTY14, METRNL) 
associated with hypo-DMRs or hyper-DhMRs exhibited significantly differential 
expression. This study revealed epigenetic changes induced by HBQs and a 
potential association with the risk of bladder cancer.

Although several prognostic models have been developed for clear cell renal cell 
carcinoma (ccRCC), these are still suboptimal and there is a need to identify 
additional prognostic biomarkers. Previously, we developed a prognostic model 
containing five DNA methylation markers (NEFH, NEURL, GATA5, GREM1, and LAD1) 
and clinicopathological characteristics based on the TNM 3rd edition and Fuhrman 
grading system. Here, we evaluated the effect of the recent ISUP/ 2022 WHO 
revisions on our previous prognostic model by incorporating the new ISUP/WHO 
standards, TNM 8th edition, and several novel prognostic factors (necrosis, 
lymphovascular invasion, sarcomatoid and rhabdoid features). Data from 308 ccRCC 
cases from the Netherlands Cohort Study were included for this study. 
Clinicopathological factors, novel prognostic factors, and the five methylation 
markers were analyzed for their individual and combined prognostic value using 
Kaplan-Meier analyses and Cox proportional hazard models. To compare models, the 
Akaike information criterion (AIC) and c-statistic were used. All evaluated 
factors were statistically significantly associated with cause-specific 
survival. The clinical model using the ISUP and TNM 8th edition performed 
similarly when compared to the Fuhrman/TNM 3rd edition model (AIC 592, 
c-statistic 0.63 and AIC 595, c-statistic 0.62, respectively). After addition of 
the five DNA methylation markers to the ISUP/TNM 8th model, this model was 
slightly improved (AIC 584, c-statistic 0.70). The addition of necrosis and 
lymphovascular invasion (LVI) did not further improve these results (AIC 586, 
c-statistic 0.71 and AIC 588, c-statistic 0.71, respectively). Despite the 
individual prognostic significance of necrosis, LVI, the presence of sarcomatoid 
and/or rhabdoid differentiation, ISUP, and TNM 8th edition, these factors did 
not influence the performance of our prognostic model. The model including the 
five DNA methylation markers, age at diagnosis, sex, TNM stage (8th edition), 
ISUP grading, and tumor size was the best performing model, thereby highlighting 
the potential importance of molecular markers.

Methylation level of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is widely recognized as a 
pivotal biomarker in precision oncology for tumor characterization and risk 
assessment. However, current point-of-care testing platforms for methylation 
analysis are constrained in achieving sufficient detection specificity due to 
their limitations in single-locus detection and their dependence on complex 
instrumentation. In this study, to overcome the above limitations, a 
smartphone-integrated, microfluidic chip technology-based biosensing platform 
was engineered for simultaneous analysis of multiple methylation loci in ctDNA. 
In this platform, whole blood samples from suspected individuals underwent GlaI 
methylation-sensitive enzyme digestion and target-specific primer hybridization, 
followed by microfluidic chip loading for on-chip colorimetric reactions. 
Methylation levels at specific loci were quantified through chamber-specific 
absorbance measurements by using the developed portable biosensing platform. The 
biosensor achieved simultaneous detection of three specific methylation loci 
(CpG sites) on the Septin 9 gene, which are associated with colorectal cancer. 
The detection limits (LODs) for the individual methylation loci are 0.25, 0.4, 
and 0.525 fM, respectively. This platform demonstrates high accuracy in 
detecting methylation signatures within blood samples from colorectal cancer 
patients, showing a significant correlation with conventional diagnostic 
methods. With its low cost and portable features, the developed biosensing 
platform may provide an economical solution for early-stage screening of cancer 
for the healthcare system in remote and under-resourced regions.

Glycosylation, a common post-translational modification of proteins, plays a 
role in numerous biological processes. However, the role of glycosylation in 
colorectal cancer (CRC) remains incompletely understood. In this study, we 
identified that CAFs exhibited the highest glycosylation levels in CRC. We 
classified 6 CAFs subgroups with distinct glycosylation profiles, revealing 
notable heterogeneity in functional activities, communication pathways, 
developmental trajectories, and metabolic states. Furthermore, we developed and 
validated a robust prognostic model capable of predicting CRC patient survival 
outcomes using 101 machine learning algorithms. The model stratified patients 
into high-risk and low-risk groups, where genetic and epigenetic alterations, 
immune infiltration patterns and responses to various therapeutic drugs varied 
significantly between the groups. In vitro experiments demonstrated that the key 
gene CCDC85B in the model influences the glycosylation levels of CRC and CD8 + T 
cell infiltration, underscoring its potential as an essential therapeutic 
target. These findings underscore the functional complexity within CAFs 
subgroups and highlight potential therapeutic targets for CRC treatment. These 
findings deepen our understanding of glycosylation and offer tools for 
prognosis, drug selection, and targeted therapy in CRC patients.

Prognostic markers such as overall survival (OS) and tertiary lymphoid structure 
(TLS) ratios, alongside diagnostic signatures like primary cancer-type 
classification, provide critical information for treatment selection, risk 
stratification, and longitudinal care planning across the oncology continuum. 
However, extracting these signals solely from sparse, high-dimensional 
multi-omics data remains a major challenge due to heterogeneity and frequent 
missingness in patient profiles. To address this challenge, we present SeNMo, a 
self-normalizing deep neural network trained on five heterogeneous omics 
layers-gene expression, DNA methylation, miRNA abundance, somatic mutations, and 
protein expression-along with the clinical variables, that learns a unified 
representation robust to missing modalities. Trained on more than 10,000 patient 
profiles across 32 tumor types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), SeNMo 
provides a baseline that can be readily fine-tuned for diverse downstream tasks. 
On a held-out TCGA test set, the model achieved a concordance index of 0.758 for 
OS prediction, while external evaluation yielded 0.73 on the CPTAC lung squamous 
cell carcinoma cohort and 0.66 on an independent 108-patient Moffitt Cancer 
Center cohort. Furthermore, on Moffitt's cohort, baseline SeNMo fine-tuned for 
TLS ratio prediction aligned with expert annotations (p < 0.05) and sharply 
separated high- versus low-TLS groups, reflecting distinct survival outcomes. 
Without altering the backbone, a single linear head classified primary cancer 
type with 99.8% accuracy across the 33 classes. By unifying diagnostic and 
prognostic predictions in a modality-robust architecture, SeNMo demonstrated 
strong performance across multiple clinically relevant tasks, including survival 
estimation, cancer classification, and TLS ratio prediction, highlighting its 
translational potential for multi-omics oncology applications.

DNA transactions introduce torsional constraints that pose an inherent risk to 
genome integrity. While topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) activity is essential for DNA 
supercoil removal, the aberrant stabilization of TOP1:DNA cleavage complexes 
(TOP1ccs) can result in cytotoxic DNA lesions. What protects genomic hot spots 
of topological stress from excessive TOP1cc accumulation remains unknown. Here, 
we identify chromatin context as an essential means to coordinate TOP1cc 
resolution. Through its ability to bind poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR), the histone 
variant macroH2A1.1 facilitates TOP1cc repair factor recruitment and lesion 
turnover, thereby preventing DNA damage in response to transcription-associated 
topological stress. The alternatively spliced macroH2A1.2 isoform is unable to 
bind PAR or protect from TOP1ccs. Impaired macroH2A1.1 splicing, a frequent 
cancer feature, was predictive of increased sensitivity to TOP1 poisons in a 
pharmaco-genomic screen in breast cancer cells, and macroH2A1.1 inactivation 
mirrored this effect. We propose macroH2A1 alternative splicing as an epigenetic 
modulator of TOP1-associated genome maintenance and a potential cancer 
vulnerability.

BACKGROUND: Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) 
are among numerous chemicals in the Per- and polyfluoroalkylated substances 
(PFAS) group, which are commonly present in various consumer and industrial 
products. These chemicals are recognized for their persistency, the ability to 
accumulate in biological systems and their documented adverse effects on human 
health. Previous research, which has primarily centered on global methylation 
patterns, has suggested that some effects of PFAS on human health may be linked 
to modifications in DNA methylation (DNAm). The aim of our study was to assess 
the relationship between the serum levels of PFOS and PFOA and CpG site-specific 
methylation of DNA from peripheral blood.
METHODS: We used a case-control study on breast cancer nested within the E3N 
cohort, a prospective study of French women, in which we measured DNAm at more 
than 850,000 CpG sites with the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip for 
166 case-control pairs. Serum levels of PFOS and PFOA were measured by liquid 
chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry.
RESULTS: We found 64 CpG sites with significant hypomethylation or 
hypermethylation associated with increased levels of PFOA or PFOS 
(p-valueBonferroni < 0.05). The strongest association was found between PFOA 
serum levels and decreased DNAm at cg06874740 (p-valueBonferroni = 2.2×10-5) and 
between PFOS serum levels and decreased DNAm at cg02793158 
(p-valueBonferroni = 9.3×10-5). Gene-set enrichment analyses using all CpG sites 
associated with PFOA or PFOS with an unadjusted p-value <0.01, identified 20 
KEGG pathways for each of these compounds.
CONCLUSION: PFAS exposure may be linked to substantial and widespread changes in 
the methylome that may be involved in the consequences on health of these 
pollutants. Our findings indicate that the biological and health effects of PFOA 
and PFOS may be more intricate and varied than previously thought, reinforcing 
the need for policies aimed at regulating this class of endocrine-disrupting 
chemicals.

INTRODUCTION: Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) methylation markers show potential 
for early detection of cancer metastasis. This study aimed to identify ctDNA 
methylation markers predictive of recurrence and prognosis in colorectal cancer 
(CRC) patients, and to explore the influence of the tumor immune 
microenvironment on outcomes.
METHODS: We analyzed 603 overlapping methylation markers from both plasma and 
tissue samples and developed a risk model to predict CRC recurrence and 
prognosis.
RESULTS: ZNF671 and ZNF132 were identified as key methylation markers. The model 
predicted relapse risk in stage III CRC patients with an AUC of 0.90 and 
prognosis in stage IV patients. High-risk patients exhibited a significantly 
higher early relapse rate (75.4% vs. 20%) and were more likely to have a low 
Immunoscore (IS), which correlates with poorer prognosis.
DISCUSSION: ZNF671 and ZNF132 methylation levels inversely correlate with 
Immunoscore and may serve as valuable biomarkers for CRC immunotherapy. These 
findings provide insights for improved prognostic evaluation and personalized 
treatment strategies.

Long-term exposure to environmental carbon black nanoparticles (CBNP) has been 
shown to increase the risk of pulmonary malignancies. However, the role of 
epigenetic regulation, particularly circular RNAs (circRNAs), in this process 
remains poorly understood. Using whole transcriptome and RNA sequencing, we 
identified that circDCP2 was upregulated in CBNP-transformed cells and 
clinically lung cancer tissues. Moreover, circDCP2 was found to promote tumor 
progression both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, N6-methyladenosine (m6A) 
modification of circDCP2 promotes the transcriptional upregulation of cyclin D1 
(CCND1) by interacting with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2/B1 
(HnRNPA2B1), thereby activating the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway and promoting 
malignant transformation. Additionally, circDCP2 facilitates the 
IGF2BP3-JAK-STAT signaling pathway, which promotes the reprogramming of 
tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) into the M2-type TAMs via cytokines 
secretion, contributing to the formation of an immunosuppressive 
microenvironment that further accelerates tumorigenesis and progression. Our 
research demonstrates that circDCP2 functions as an important regulator in 
promoting CBNP-induced lung carcinogenesis and may serve as a potential 
diagnostic biomarker and a promising therapeutic target for lung cancer 
patients.

Mini-chromosome maintenance protein 6 (MCM6), a member of the DNA replication 
initiation complex, is considered a potential prognostic marker for multiple 
tumors. However, the biological role of MCM6 has not been reported in 
pan-cancer. In present study, a pan-cancer analysis of MCM6 was performed using 
multiple databases and online websites. The relationship between MCM6 and DNA 
methylation, prognosis, immune infiltration and immunotherapy response was 
investigated. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and least 
absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression models were 
performed to construct prognostic risk signature for lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) 
based on MCM6-related cell cycle genes (MrCCGs). Meanwhile, the biological 
function of MCM6 in lung adenocarcinoma was further verified through in vivo and 
in vitro experiments. MCM6 is highly expressed and is a prognostic risk factor 
in most tumors. MCM6 expression is significantly associated with the 
infiltration of immune cells (especially MDSCs) in a variety of tumors. The risk 
signature based on MrCCGs can reliably predict the prognosis of LUAD 
(AUC = 0.739). Immunohistochemical staining showed that the expression of MCM6 
is higher in lung adenocarcinoma tissues compared with para-cancer tissues and 
is associated with the poor prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma patients. In vitro, 
MCM6 knockdown inhibited proliferation, invasion, and migration of A549 and 
H1299 cells, and blocked the G1 phase of the A549 cell cycle. In vivo, knockdown 
of MCM6 inhibited the growth of xenograft tumors in nude mice. The study 
suggests that MCM6 may be a potential prognostic and immunological biomarker in 
many cancers.

Epstein-Barr virus, the first identified human DNA tumour virus, is detectable 
in more than 90% of nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients in endemic regions. The 3D 
chromosome conformation analysis reveals that virus‒host chromatin interactions 
induce the spatial reorganisation of loops and compartments, resulting in 
""enhancer infestation"" and switch of ""H3K27 bivalency"" at EBV-interacting 
regions. Through this mechanism, EBV hijacks KDM5B, a gatekeeper of genome 
stability, and its binding targets, leading to aberrant activation of an 
EBVIR-enhancer-KDM5B signature. Cancer cells with this signature present 
increased MYC activation, DNA damage responses, and epigenetic plasticity of 
epithelial-immune dual features with metastatic potential. Our multicentre 
multiomics study confirms that this signature is the prerequisite for chromosome 
instability and can be utilised as a risk factor for distant metastasis. This 
study highlights a mechanism in which latent viral episomes can alter the host 
high-order epigenotype, promoting transcriptional rewiring and metastasis in 
NPC.

BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a primary contributor to 
cancer-associated mortality, necessitates enhanced early detection. This study 
evaluated machine learning models that merge methylated SEPTIN9 (SEPT9) and 
secreted frizzled-related protein 2 (SFRP2) within circulating cell-free DNA 
(cfDNA) to detect HCC.
METHODS: A cohort of 165 healthy volunteers, 24 precancerous patients of HCC and 
112 HCC patients were divided into training and validation sets. Methylated 
SEPT9 and SFRP2 (mSEPT9/mSFRP2) were detected using real-time PCR. Based on 
those methylation biomarkers and/or conventional biomarkers (CEA, AFP, CA125, 
and CA19-9), six machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest (RF), were 
employed to establish models for the training set. Models were evaluated for 
area under the ROC curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity, and subsequently 
validated in the validation set.
RESULTS: The RF model outperformed other models. In training, it achieved an AUC 
of 0.834 (95% CI: 0.745-0.923), exhibiting 69.3% sensitivity and 80.6% 
specificity for the methylation-specific signature group (mSS group: 
mSEPT9/mSFRP2). In validation, the RF model for the mSS group showed an AUC of 
0.865 (95% CI: 0.811-0.946), with 85.4% sensitivity and 71.4% specificity.
CONCLUSIONS: The RF-based model integrating mSEPT9/mSFRP2 in cfDNA can be a 
promising approach for HCC diagnosis.

Plain Language Summary: Liver cancer is often found too late for effective 
treatment. To help detect it earlier, we developed a simple blood test that 
looks for chemical changes in two genes (SEPT9 and SFRP2) released by tumors. By 
combining these gene signals with artificial intelligence (AI), our test 
correctly identified 85% of liver cancer cases while reducing false alarms. This 
approach offers a less invasive way to screen high-risk individuals, potentially 
saving lives through earlier diagnosis.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) and its metastatic form (mCRC) demonstrate considerable 
biological and clinical heterogeneity. By analyzing transcriptomic data from CRC 
and mCRC patients, we identified significant differences in gene expression 
profiles between the two. Our study focused on immune-related differentially 
expressed genes, which enabled the classification of CRC patients into four 
distinct subgroups based on their gene expression patterns. These subgroups 
exhibited marked differences in overall survival (OS) and immune infiltration 
levels, with Group 1 characterized by a robust immune response.To refine 
prognostic assessment, we employed a LASSO regression model to select core genes 
and developed a risk scoring system with promising clinical utility. 
Furthermore, methylation analysis uncovered notable epigenetic distinctions 
between CRC and mCRC, particularly involving the SALL1 gene and its methylation 
sites. Among these, the methylation level at the cg13755795 site emerged as an 
independent prognostic biomarker, offering predictive value for patient 
outcomes.Our findings provide a comprehensive view of the transcriptomic and 
epigenetic differences between CRC and mCRC, identify novel prognostic 
biomarkers and therapeutic targets, and propose potential strategies for 
personalized prognosis prediction and targeted therapy. This work contributes 
valuable insights into immune regulatory mechanisms and supports the development 
of advanced treatment approaches for colorectal cancer.

BACKGROUND: Lynch syndrome (LS) and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) are 
hereditary cancer predisposing syndromes characterized by increased risk of 
especially early-onset colorectal cancer. Predisposition to LS is caused by 
germline mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes leading to elevated cancer 
progression and microsatellite instability. FAP is associated with germline 
mutations in APC promoting cancer initiation and chromosomal instability. DNA 
methylation is an important epigenetic mechanism in early tumorigenesis via, 
e.g., field defects in non-neoplastic colon. Our aim was to study genome-wide 
methylation changes in colorectal specimens (adenomas and carcinomas 
supplemented with paired normal colon) obtained during colonoscopy surveillance, 
and explore the role of such alterations in tumorigenesis, with a special focus 
on early changes. To our best knowledge, this study is the first one to compare 
altered DNA methylation genome-wide in LS and FAP-associated colorectal 
neoplasia.
RESULTS: DNA methylation alterations were subtle in FAP adenomas, whereas in LS 
adenomas, changes were abundant when compared to their normal counterparts. When 
FAP normal and LS normal colon were compared, DNA methylation changes of FAP 
normal colon mirrored those occurring in LS tumors, suggesting that colorectal 
tumorigenesis-associated DNA methylation alterations take place already in FAP 
normal colon mucosa. DNA methylation age was more variable in LS than FAP normal 
colon, and in proximal than distal colon, when compared to individuals' age at 
the time of sampling. In LS tumors, DNA methylation changes (hyper- and 
hypomethylation) were abundant even in adenomas with low-grade dysplasia and 
stable microsatellites and peaked in adenomas with high-grade dysplasia. LINE-1 
hypomethylation was more prominent in LS adenomas than FAP adenomas, but normal 
colon of LS and FAP displayed similar levels of LINE-1 methylation.
CONCLUSIONS: Genome-wide DNA methylation changes are an integral part of FAP and 
LS-associated colorectal tumorigenesis. Occurrence at early stages, even in 
non-neoplastic colonic mucosa, and increased prevalence with progressive 
dysplasia suggest a role in tumor development. Overlap of many of the topmost 
DNA methylation alterations between LS and FAP, and previous reports of their 
occurrence in sporadic colorectal and other tumors as well, imply their broad 
biological relevance and possible biomarker potential for clinical applications.

BACKGROUND: Aberrant methylation of Neuropeptide Y (NPY) gene has emerged as a 
promising biomarker for monitoring metastatic colorectal cancer and predicting 
its early recurrence. Current standard approaches for the detection of NPY 
hypermethylation levels rely on the use of enzymes and are associated with high 
costs, long times of analysis and interferences from PCR inhibitors, which 
limits their applicability in point-of-care or low-resource environments. 
Therefore, the need for an affordable, rapid, and sensitive technology for NPY 
methylation detection is clear.
RESULTS: Herein we present a novel, rapid, sensitive, highly selective, and 
enzyme-free photoelectrochemical ratiometric bio-platform for the detection and 
quantification of NPY gene hypermethylation. At the core of this method lies the 
use of magnetic microbeads and singlet oxygen (1O2)-based photoelectrochemical 
detection. The use of bisulfite conversion and hybridization temperature allowed 
to achieve a 99 % discrimination efficiency of the methylated NPY target from 
the unmethylated one. Detection of 18 pM (18 fmol) of 94-nucleotide methylated 
NPY target sequence with 6 methylation sites in hybridization buffer and 45 pM 
(45 fmol) against the background of genomic DNA was achieved without any 
amplification. Ultimately, ratiometric quantitative sensing of methylated NPY 
gene over reference albumin gene was carried out and an LOD of 2 % methylation 
level was obtained.
SIGNIFICANCE: Overall, this technique demonstrated immense potential in 
overcoming the complexity, high costs, and need for enzymes of current 
strategies for hypermethylation detection and thus represents a great innovation 
in (photo)electrochemical sensing of aberrant DNA methylation. It, therefore, 
holds great promise for establishing in future a clinically relevant 
point-of-care testing device.

INTRODUCTION: Retrotransposons (REs) constitute nearly half of the genome and 
include long terminal repeat (LTR) elements, Long INterspersed Elements (LINE), 
and Short INterspersed Elements (SINE). REs are typically silenced in somatic 
tissues via DNA methylation but can be reactivated through DNA hypomethylation, 
potentially impacting gene regulation. Here, we investigate genome-scale 
profiles of RE methylation in high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) and 
associations with survival among Black women.
METHODS: Methylation levels of LTR, LINE-1, and Alu (type of SINE) in 200 HGSOC 
tumors were predicted using a random forest approach and clustered using 
multiple consensus algorithms. Associations between RE methylation clusters and 
survival were evaluated using Cox proportional hazard regression, adjusting for 
age, stage, and debulking status. We performed sensitivity analyses restricted 
to women with late-stage disease and with adjustment for BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations.
RESULTS: Two RE methylation clusters were identified. Cluster 1 exhibited a more 
hypomethylated RE profile (""Active""), while Cluster 2 was more hypermethylated 
(""Repressed""). No statistically significant differences in patient or clinical 
characteristics were observed between clusters. Compared to the Active Cluster, 
the Repressed Cluster was associated with an increased risk of mortality 
(HR = 2.41; 95% CI 1.04-5.59) and had a lower proportion of T cells. This 
association was consistent in sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSION: A more hypermethylated RE profile was linked to worse survival among 
Black women with HGSOC, highlighting the potential of RE methylation as a 
prognostic biomarker. Further research is needed to understand the underlying 
biological mechanisms and their implications in ovarian cancer biology and 
treatment.

Background and Objectives: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major cause of cancer 
morbidity and mortality worldwide. Genetic and epigenetic changes, especially 
DNA methylation alterations, are key in CRC development. LINE-1 hypomethylation 
marks global DNA methylation loss and genomic instability, making it a potential 
early CRC biomarker. This study investigates the methylation status of LINE-1 in 
colorectal adenocarcinoma, precancerous lesions (tubular and serrated adenomas), 
and the surrounding normal mucosa, aiming to elucidate its role as an epigenetic 
marker in early colorectal tumorigenesis. Materials and Methods: Paired lesion 
and normal tissue samples from 66 patients were analyzed for LINE-1 methylation 
at three CpG sites using bisulfite pyrosequencing. Results: Adenocarcinomas and 
tubular adenomas showed significant hypomethylation, especially at loci A and B, 
while serrated adenomas exhibited no significant differences. Conclusions: 
LINE-1 hypomethylation is associated with colorectal tumorigenesis, with 
distinct patterns observed between tubular and serrated adenomas, indicating 
distinct pathways forming and progressing specific adenomas. These findings 
support the potential of LINE-1 methylation as an early epigenetic biomarker for 
CRC risk stratification and highlight the need for further research into its 
clinical utility.

Arsenic (As3+) is a well-established environmental carcinogen known to induce 
malignant transformation and cancer stem-like cell (CSC) properties in somatic 
cells, with Nrf2 functioning as a central regulator. However, the impact of 
chronic As3+ exposure on pluripotent stem cells, particularly through 
Nrf2-mediated epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming, remains largely 
unexplored. In this study, we chronically exposed human induced pluripotent stem 
cells (iPSCs, Nips-B2) to an environmentally relevant concentration of trivalent 
arsenic (0.25 μM, As3+) for three months. The tumorigenic potential of exposed 
iPSCs was evaluated using anchorage-independent growth assays and xenograft 
models, while mechanistic insights were gained via chromatin immunoprecipitation 
sequencing (ChIP-seq) for Nrf2 and key histone modifications (H3K4me3, H3K9me3, 
H3K27me3, H3K36me3, and H4K20me3), alongside transcriptomic profiling by RNA 
sequencing (RNA-seq). Prolonged exposure markedly enhanced tumor sphere 
formation in vitro and accelerated tumor growth in vivo, indicating the 
acquisition of CSC-like traits. Integrated ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analyses 
revealed widespread Nrf2 chromatin binding and global epigenetic remodeling, 
characterized by increased levels of H3K27me3, H3K36me3, and H4K20me3, a modest 
rise in H3K9me3, and reduced H3K4me3. Notably, As3+ exposure enhanced Nrf2 
binding at loci regulating glycolysis, cholesterol biosynthesis, self-renewal, 
and oncogenesis. Functional analyses confirmed that transcriptional and 
metabolic changes were Nrf2-driven and closely linked to H3K36me3 and H3K27me3 
dynamics. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that chronic As3+ exposure 
reprograms iPSCs through Nrf2 activation and coordinated epigenetic remodeling, 
revealing a novel mechanism by which environmental carcinogens exploit stem cell 
plasticity to initiate CSC-like transformation.

Until recently, cisplatin/gemcitabine was standard of care for the first-line 
treatment of patients with advanced biliary tract cancer (BTC). The addition of 
durvalumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor, to the combination of 
cisplatin/gemcitabine has demonstrated an overall survival (OS) benefit and is 
now a standard of care first-line treatment option. BTCs exhibit immunogenic 
features may develop through an accumulation of genetic and epigenetic 
alterations, and can be influenced by microbial exposure. Microbiota can 
influence inflammation and immunity, and its disruption may impair tumor 
response to immunotherapy and chemotherapy. Here, the rationale and design of 
the multi-center, single-arm ABC-12 trial (ISRCTN11210442) is described, which 
investigates the role of the microbiome in patients with advanced BTC in a 
first-line study of durvalumab (MEDI4736) in combination with 
cisplatin/gemcitabine. The primary objective is to determine the difference in 
baseline alpha diversity between ""responders"" (partial or complete response) and 
""non-responders"" at 18 weeks (RECIST 1.1) in patients treated with 
cisplatin/gemcitabine/durvalumab. Secondary objectives include investigating the 
association between microbiome parameters and objective response rate, tumor 
control (partial, complete response, and stable disease), progression-free and 
OS, and investigating the interaction between treatment effect and microbiome 
parameters on clinical outcomes.

Plain Language Summary: Biliary tract cancers (BTCs) are highly lethal cancers. 
Until recently, cisplatin plus gemcitabine was the standard chemotherapy regimen 
for patients with BTC where surgery was not possible. Durvalumab is an 
immunotherapy which works by assisting the immune system to recognize and attack 
cancer cells. The addition of durvalumab to cisplatin and gemcitabine has shown 
a survival benefit.Thousands of bacteria live in the human digestive system, 
which are called the microbiota. Each person has an individual community of 
microorganisms, and the microbiome is a collection of genomes (genetic material) 
from all the microorganisms in the environment, and this varies greatly from one 
person to the other. This is responsible for the breakdown of food, changing 
food into energy for the body, and protecting against infections. It also helps 
in developing the immune system. Research shows that its disruption can cause 
disease, including cancer, and can affect response to chemotherapy and 
immunotherapy. The aim of this trial is to assess whether the number and types 
of bacteria that live naturally in saliva and the bowel impact the response to 
the combination of immunotherapy with cisplatin and gemcitabine in patients with 
biliary tract cancer, where cure is not possible.

BACKGROUND: Current evidence suggests an increased risk for cancer mortality in 
those with low aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor (AHRR) DNA methylation (DNAm) 
levels. Therefore, AHRR DNAm could identify a more ""fragile"" group at risk for 
cancer mortality than questionnaire-based evaluations. Given this, the aim was 
to identify ""fragile"" groups at risk of cancer mortality by integrating 
questionnaire-based smoking indices and leukocyte AHRR DNAm levels in the 
Japanese population.
METHODS: The target population was 795 participants without a clinical history 
who underwent a health checkup in 1990. They were followed for up to 30 years 
for mortality. The AHRR DNAm levels in leukocytes were measured by the 
pyrosequencing method. HRs for cancer mortality were calculated using a Cox 
proportional hazards model.
RESULTS: Significantly higher HRs for all-cancer mortality were observed in low 
AHRR DNAm groups regardless of smoking intensity [pack-years <20: 3.69 
(1.46-9.37); pack-years ≥20: 2.13 (1.11-4.09)]. Compared with current smokers, 
significantly lower HRs for all-cancer mortality were observed in the group with 
high AHRR DNAm regardless of years since quitting [YSQ ≤10: 0.13 (0.02-0.96); 
YSQ >10: 0.28 (0.08-0.98)]. Even for YSQ greater than 10, there was no 
significant mortality risk reduction in the low AHRR DNAm group.
CONCLUSIONS: The population with low AHRR DNAm levels had a higher risk of 
cancer mortality even with low smoking exposure. Furthermore, no significant 
risk reduction was observed in former smokers with low AHRR DNAm levels.
IMPACT: AHRR DNAm levels in leukocytes may help identify groups at risk for 
cancer mortality overlooked by questionnaire-based smoking indices.

Radon (Rn) exposure has a strong association with lung cancer risk and is 
influenced by epigenetic modifications. To investigate the characterization of 
DNA methylation (DNAm) episignatures for radon-induced lung cancer, we detected 
the specific changes in DNAm in blood and lung tissues using reduced 
representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS). We identified the differentially 
methylated regions (DMRs) induced by radon exposure. The bioinformatics analysis 
of the DMR-mapped genes revealed that pathways in cancer were affected by radon 
exposure. Among them, the DNAm episignatures of MAPK10, PLCG1, PLCβ3 and PIK3R2 
were repeated between lung tissue and blood, and validated by the MassArray. In 
addition, radon exposure promoted lung cancer development in the genetic 
engineering mouse model (GEMM), accompanied by decreased MAPK10 and increased 
PLCG1, PLCβ3, and PIK3R2 with mRNA and protein levels. Conclusively, radon 
exposure significantly changes the genomic DNAm patterns in lung tissue and 
blood. The DNAm episignatures of MAPK10, PLCG1, PLCβ3 and PIK3R2 have a 
significant influence on radon-induced lung cancer. This brings a new 
perspective to understanding the pathways involved in radon-induced lung cancer 
and offers potential targets for developing blood-based biomarkers and 
epigenetic therapeutics.

Brain cancer represents a complex disease influenced by a multitude of genetic 
and epigenetic factors. This study aims to elucidate the role of specific single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the 
pathogenesis of brain cancer, employing a multi-omics approach. We conducted 
extensive eQTL, mQTL, haQTL, sQTL, and caQTL analyses to identify genetic 
variants and lncRNAs associated with brain cancer. Integration with GWAS-GWAS 
colocalization analysis provided insights into shared genetic mechanisms with 
other diseases. We further investigated copy number variation (CNV) and 
methylation status in relation to gene expression, and their prognostic 
implications in different brain cancer subtypes. SNP rs615552_AL359922.1 
exhibited significant colocalization with key genes CDKN2A, CDKN2B, and 
CDKN2B-AS1, implicating its role in the regulation of gene expression. The long 
non-coding RNA CDKN2B-AS1 demonstrated both co-occurrence and co-expression with 
CDKN2A and CDKN2B, suggesting a coordinated regulatory mechanism among these 
genes. TERT emerged as a gene with shared susceptibility across brain cancer and 
other diseases, indicating a common genetic pathway. Methylation sites 
associated with mQTL, such as cg03935379 (TERT) and cg14069088 (CDKN2A), were 
identified as independent prognostic factors for lower-grade glioma (LGG), but 
not for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Bulk RNA-seq, spatial, and single-cell 
transcriptomic analyses revealed that CDKN2B-AS1 is predominantly expressed in 
malignant and dendritic cells (DCs), and is associated with DNA repair pathways 
in malignant cells and antigen presentation genes in DCs. This study offers a 
comprehensive perspective on the genetic and molecular factors influencing brain 
cancer. The results highlight the intricate nature of gene regulation in cancer 
and suggest the potential of CDKN2B-AS1 as a key regulator of immune responses 
and tumor suppressor genes. The SNP rs615552_AL359922.1 represents a significant 
pathogenic SNP for brain cancer. The identification of shared genetic 
mechanisms, particularly involving TERT, with other diseases points to new 
opportunities for developing therapeutic targets and diagnostic tools. Future 
research should focus on functional validation and the investigation of 
environmental interactions to fully leverage these findings for advancing brain 
cancer management.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a prevalent and lethal malignancy influenced by 
genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors, with diverse molecular subtypes 
and varying incidence rates across different populations. The anatomical, 
histological, morphological, and genetic differences between the right and left 
colons contribute to disparities in tumor incidence, clinical presentation, 
prognosis, and therapeutic responses, depending on the tumor's localization. We 
aimed to investigate the expression patterns of the CMTM3 and SSTR2 genes both 
of which are hypermethylated and potentially involved in the development and 
progression of colorectal tumors in tumors originating from the right and left 
colon. The study consisted of 89 histopathologically diagnosed tumour tissue 
samples, 42 from the right colon and 47 from the left colon, and 89 healthy 
tissue samples from the same individuals adjacent to the tumour tissue. The 
expression of the CMTM3 and SSTR2 genes was analysed using the comparative CT 
(ΔΔCT) method in real-time PCR. Our findings demonstrated a significant 
upregulation of CMTM3 and SSTR2 expression in tumor tissues compared to adjacent 
normal tissues (p < 0.05). Notably, CMTM3 expression was significantly higher in 
left-sided colon tumors (2-ΔΔCT = 20.95) compared to those originating from the 
right colon (2-ΔΔCT = 14.13) (p = 0.027). This study is the first to suggest 
that elevated CMTM3 expression may be associated with the increased incidence 
and distinct molecular behavior of left-sided colorectal tumors. Results provide 
novel insights into the molecular heterogeneity of colorectal cancer, 
emphasizing the importance of tumor localization in understanding disease 
mechanisms and informing targeted therapeutic strategies.

BACKGROUND: Efficient triage of high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV)-positive 
women is essential to avoid unnecessary referrals and overtreatment. This study 
evaluates the diagnostic accuracy of the commercially available DNA methylation 
panel, GynTect® (ASTN1, DLX1, ITGA4, RXFP3, SOX17, and ZNF671), in cervical 
cytology samples from 146 women for detecting cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 
grade 3 (CIN3) or cervical carcinoma (CC). This analysis focuses particularly on 
the performance of the ZNF671 methylation marker (ZNF671m) within the panel.
RESULTS: The positive rates of all triage markers-hrHPV, TCT, HPV16/18, 
GynTect®, and ZNF671m-correlated with increasing severity of CIN lesions 
(Chi-squared test for trend, P < 0.01). ZNF671m exhibited the highest Area Under 
the Curve (AUC) of 0.811 (95% CI: 0.734-0.888) for identifying CIN3 + cases, 
closely followed by GynTect® (AUC 0.800, 95% CI: 0.721-0.878). Among 102 
hrHPV-positive women, employing GynTect® or ZNF671m instead of TCT yielded 
identical sensitivity (0.84; 95% CI: 0.69-1.01) but enhanced specificity (86% 
and 90%, respectively) for detecting CIN3 +. Adding HPV16/18 to the triage 
strategy maintained similar outcomes. Additionally, ZNF671m showed a significant 
risk difference (60.0%; 95% CI 42.8-77.1%) for detecting CIN3 +, on par with 
GynTect® (57.6%; 95% CI 37.9-71.2%).
CONCLUSION: ZNF671m within the GynTect® panel demonstrates robust triage 
performance in diagnosing CIN3 + cases, with efficacy comparable to the full 
panel. These findings suggest that ZNF671m could be a promising alternative for 
cytologic triage, warranting further validation.

BACKGROUND: Monocytes are recruited to tumors and undergo transcriptional 
reprogramming resulting in tumor-promoting functions. Epigenomic features, such 
as post-translational modification of histones and chromatin accessibility, are 
key determinants of transcription factor binding and thereby play an important 
role in controlling transcriptional responses to the tissue environment. It 
remains unknown whether systemic tumor-associated signals could alter the 
epigenomic landscape of peripheral monocytes before they reach the tumor, thus 
shaping their subsequent response to the tumor microenvironment.
METHODS: We used a combination of genome-wide assays for chromatin accessibility 
and multiple histone modifications (H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K27ac) in a mouse tumor 
model to investigate changes in the epigenomic landscape of peripheral 
monocytes. We then integrated these epigenomic data with transcriptomic data to 
link altered regulatory elements to gene expression changes in monocytes 
occurring in the periphery or during tumor infiltration.
RESULTS: We found that tumor-induced systemic inflammation was associated with 
transcriptional and epigenomic preconditioning of peripheral monocytes. The 
distal tumor caused extensive remodeling of both H3K4me3+ promoters and H3K4me1+ 
enhancers. Specifically, this involved the repression of interferon-responsive 
regulatory elements as well as the establishment of enhancers harboring binding 
motifs for transcription factor families downstream of pro-inflammatory 
signaling, such as C/EBP, AP-1, and STAT. Reprogrammed enhancers in peripheral 
monocytes were linked to sustained gene expression changes that persisted after 
tumor infiltration. In addition, key pro-tumor genes upregulated in 
tumor-infiltrating monocytes showed epigenetic priming already in the 
circulation.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that cancer-associated remodeling of the 
epigenomic landscape in peripheral monocytes can shape the gene expression 
programs they acquire in the tumor, highlighting the role of the epigenome in 
redirecting monocyte function to support cancer progression.

The use of epigenetic clocks for measuring age acceleration in the field of 
cancer research has been a common practice for many years. In forensic genetics, 
DNA methylation can be used to estimate the age of a stain donor. As lifestyle 
and disease can alter a person's methylation profile, the accuracy of forensic 
age estimation tools might decrease compared to the chronological age when 
estimating a person affected by cancer. In our study, we applied the VISAGE 
enhanced age estimation tool on blood samples from cancer patients suffering 
from a variety of cancer entities, including solid and hematologic tumours. A 
comparison of the age estimation errors between the cancer patients (n = 100) 
and a healthy control cohort (n = 102) revealed small statistically significant 
differences and a tendency towards age acceleration in the blood of these 
patients. Although this study showed that in patients with aggressive cancers 
(like CLL or AML) estimation accuracy is clearly decreased, for most entities 
the observed differences were subtle and an analysis of individual CpG sites did 
not reveal strikingly different methylation patterns. Conclusively, age 
estimation on blood stains from cancer patients might not result in 
significantly higher estimation errors, except for very aggressive forms of 
cancer.

Histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) have been linked to various 
pathological processes, especially in cancer onset, where they are envisaged as 
obvious diagnostic biomarkers and pivotal predictors for pathological prognosis. 
Consequently, their mapping and characterization constitute a critical field of 
study facilitated by recent advances in the high-throughput mass spectrometry 
technique. The current study aimed to clarify the neurotoxicity mechanisms at 
the epigenetic level induced by environmental stressors by examining their 
potential to induce aberrant histone methylation as it is the most involved 
modification in carcinogenesis. Our protocol first consisted of a 3D in vitro 
neurospheroid model derived from human high-grade gliomas, followed by treatment 
with a pesticide mixture. Furthermore, we analyzed histone isoform-digested 
peptides by shotgun proteomics with high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry, 
complemented by Western blotting to validate epigenetic changes. Our results 
revealed two major findings: First, histone demethylation in nontreated samples 
emphasizes the aggressiveness and poor prognosis of high-grade gliomas. Second, 
histone hypermethylation phenotype in treated samples underlies the adaptive 
strategy employed by cancer cells to overcome stress and promote progression, 
which is a hallmark characteristic of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-mutated 
gliomas. Hence, our findings not only help bridge the gap in knowledge about 
chromatin regulation but also pave the way for the development of targeted 
therapeutic approaches modulating histone hypermethylation in gliomas.

BACKGROUND: Cytotoxic agents remain the mainstay treatment for advanced 
gastrointestinal cancer. However, the number of cytotoxic agents is limited, and 
the treatment effect is not satisfactory. Therefore, new agent and combination 
strategies are to be explored.
METHODS: The antitumor efficacy of low-dose epigenetic modifiers (LD-EMs) of 
5-azacytidine and entinostat, cytotoxic agents of paclitaxel, cisplatin, 
oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and a novel cytotoxic agent TIC10, and the 
combination of LD-EMs and cytotoxic agents was investigated in vivo. Flow 
cytometry and immunohistochemistry were conducted to analyze the immune 
phenotype in the tumor microenvironment. The proliferation and apoptosis 
analyses were performed in vitro.
RESULTS: LD-EM therapy demonstrated superior tumor inhibition compared with 
commonly used chemotherapy in gastrointestinal cancer. A novel cytotoxic agent 
TIC10 resulted in weak to moderate tumor growth inhibition (TGI). LD-EMs 
exhibited a more pronounced antitumor effect than TIC10 alone (CT26: TGI of 
74.5% vs. 46.2%, respectively; p < 0.05; HNM007: TGI of 52.0% vs. 21.4%, 
respectively; p < 0.05; AKR: TGI of 53.8% vs. 10.1%, respectively; p < 0.05). 
The combination of TIC10 and LD-EMs led to a more pronounced tumor reduction 
with tolerable toxicity. Analysis of the immune profiles showed increased 
percentages of CD45+ lymphocytes, CD3+ and CD8+ T cells, M1 macrophages, and 
dendritic cells, whereas decreased percentages of M2 macrophages and 
myeloid-derived suppressor cells under treatment with LD-EMs and combination 
therapy. Mechanistic studies revealed that LD-EMs activated the RIG-I-MAVS 
pathway, stimulated type I interferon responses, and subsequently promoted 
chemokine secretion. In contrast, TIC10 suppressed cell viability and induced 
cell apoptosis.
CONCLUSIONS: LD-EMs remodeled the tumor microenvironment to an immune-promoting 
environment. Although TIC10 could suppress cell viability and induce cell 
apoptosis. A combination of LD-EMs and TIC10 indicated a rational strategy 
through complementary mechanisms.

High-Resolution Genotyping of HLA Alleles and Association with Genetic 
Background of Virological Response in Chronic Hepatitis B.

Tălăngescu A, Bratei AA, Tizu M, Calenic B, Constantinescu AE, Constantinescu I.

BACKGROUND: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major global health problem 
and can cause chronic infections and promote the development of cirrhosis and 
liver cancer. In the current investigation, we focused on evaluating the 
association between human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I and II genotyping, HBV 
viral load, and the presence of steatosis in CHB (chronic hepatitis B) patients.
METHODS: In this study, we evaluated 204 patients with CHB who did not receive 
antiviral therapy before inclusion in the study and during the follow-up period. 
All patients were divided into 2 categories based on their HBV DNA levels. The 
presence of hepatic steatosis was determined by an ultrasound examination and 
SteatoTest. HLA genotyping for 11 genes, including HLA class I and class II, was 
conducted using next-generation sequencing.
RESULTS: Four HLA class II alleles, HLA-DQA1*01:02:02 (p = 0.019), 
HLA-DQB1*05:02:01 (p = 0.014), HLA-DRB1*16:01:01 (p = 0.032), and 
HLA-DRB5*02:02:01 (p = 0.052), were found to be positively associated with high 
levels of HBV-DNA. Furthermore, when studying the association of HLA class I and 
class II alleles with hepatic steatosis, our data showed that HLA-B*08:01:01 (p 
= 0.011), HLA-C*07:01:01 (p = 0.011), and HLA-DRB3*01:01:02 (p = 0.027) were 
positively correlated with the presence of hepatic steatosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Integrating next-generation sequencing data of HLA genes in genomic 
and epigenomic data can offer a comprehensive understanding of the molecular 
mechanisms underlying HBV infection. This integrated approach will help identify 
new biomarkers, deeply understand the complex interactions between genetic and 
epigenetic factors, and facilitate the development of personalized prevention 
and treatment strategies.

Epigenetic clocks have been widely applied to assess biological ageing, with Age 
Acceleration (AA) serving as a key metric linked to adverse health outcomes, 
including mortality. However, the comparative predictive value of AAs derived 
from different epigenetic clocks for mortality risk has not been systematically 
evaluated. In this retrospective cohort study based on 1,942 NHANES participants 
(median age 65 years; 944 women), we examined the associations between AAs from 
multiple epigenetic clocks and the risks of all-cause, cancer-specific, and 
cardiac mortality. Restricted cubic spline models were used to assess the shape 
of these associations, and Cox proportional hazards regression was employed to 
quantify risk estimates. Model performance was compared using the Akaike 
Information Criterion (AIC) and concordance index (C-index). Our findings 
revealed that only GrimAge AA and GrimAge2 AA demonstrated approximately linear 
and positive associations with all three mortality outcomes. Both were 
significantly associated with increased risks of death, and these associations 
were consistent across most subgroups. GrimAge and GrimAge2 AAs showed very 
similar performance in predicting all-cause, cancer and cardiac mortality, with 
only small differences in AIC values and C-index scores. These findings suggest 
that both GrimAge and GrimAge2 are effective epigenetic biomarkers for mortality 
risk prediction and may be valuable tools in future ageing-related research.

Precision prevention strategies for cervical cancer that integrate genetic 
biomarkers provide opportunities for personalized risk assessment and optimized 
preventive measures. An HPV infection-Precancerous-Cancer risk assessment model 
incorporating genetic polymorphisms and DNA methylation was developed to better 
understand the regression and progression of cervical lesions by HPV infection 
status. Utilizing a virtual cohort of 300,000 Taiwanese women aged 30 years and 
older, our model simulated the natural history of cervical cancer, capturing 
transitions from a healthy state through precancerous lesions (LSILs and HSILs) 
to invasive carcinoma and incorporating the possibility of regression between 
states. Genetic and epigenetic markers significantly influenced disease 
transitions, demonstrating heterogeneous risks among women with distinct 
molecular biomarker profiles. Guided by these individual risk profiles, tailored 
preventive strategies including varying intervals for Pap smear screening, HPV 
DNA testing, and HPV vaccination showed improved efficiency and effectiveness in 
reducing cervical cancer incidence compared to uniform approaches. The proposed 
dynamic transition model of cervical neoplasms incorporating genetic biomarkers 
can facilitate the development of an individualized risk-based approach for 
guiding precision prevention towards the goal of cervical cancer elimination.

UPF3B encodes a protein that is part of a postsplicing multi-protein complex 
involved in both mRNA nuclear export and mRNA surveillance. Herein, we 
demonstrate that UPF3B accelerates the proliferation ability of liver cancer 
cells in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, UPF3B affects epigenetic regulation in 
human liver cancer cells. Moreover, ATAC-seq results show that chromatin 
accessibility is changed between rLV group and rLV-UPF3B group. Therefore, UPF3B 
alters transcriptome and proteome in liver cancer. In particular, UPF3B affects 
the heterogeneity of liver cancer and its microenvironment network. Furthermore, 
UPF3B promotes the modification ability of H3K4me3, H4K16Ac, and RNAPolII on 
promoter region of CDK12 and then increased the expression of CDK12. Strikingly, 
UPF3B enhances the interaction between LC3 and DOR, ATG4 and LC3, ATG3 and LC3, 
ATG3 and ATG12, ATG3 and ATG16L1, ATG3 and ATG7, ATG3 and ATG9A, and the 
expression of activated LC3, beclin1 dependent on CDK12. Ultimately, UPF3B 
increases the autophagy via CDK12 and then enhances the expression of ARAF, 
RRAS, CyclinD1, C-myc, PCNA, PKM2, CDK4, YB-1, H-Ras via CDK12-autophagy 
pathway. Importantly, our results indicate that CDK12 determines the oncogenic 
function of UPF3B. In conclusions, these results provide basis for research on 
liver cancer prevention and treatment.

Background: Advanced prostate cancer is a biologically heterogeneous disease 
often marked by multiple genetic and epigenetic alterations that influence tumor 
progression, treatment resistance, and prognosis. Among the most frequently 
altered genes are PTEN, AR-V7, TP53, TMPRSS2-ERG, and ERBB2, each with potential 
relevance for stratifying risk and guiding targeted therapy. Methods: This 
retrospective study included 43 patients with advanced prostate cancer who 
underwent radical prostatectomy. Tumor specimens were analyzed using 
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to assess the mutational status of the 
five markers. Clinicopathological parameters, including PSA levels, Gleason 
score, tumor stage, and invasion status, were correlated with molecular 
alterations using multinomial logistic regression. Results: The most common 
isolated alteration was PTEN loss (20.9%), followed by TP53 amplification 
(16.3%), TMPRSS2-ERG fusion (13.9%), AR-V7 expression (11.6%), and ERBB2 
amplification (7%). Combined alterations were also observed, with dual or triple 
marker expression in select aggressive cases. PTEN- and AR-V7+ were associated 
with low PSA values despite aggressive pathology, while ERBB2+ correlated with 
high PSA levels and high Gleason scores. TP53+ and ERBB2+ were also 
significantly associated with high-grade tumors (Gleason 7). AR-V7+ was the only 
marker significantly associated with seminal vesicle invasion. Younger age was 
weakly correlated with AR-V7+ and TP53+ status. Conclusions: The molecular 
profile defined by PTEN, AR-V7, TP53, and ERBB2 identifies distinct biological 
subtypes in advanced prostate cancer, each with specific prognostic and 
therapeutic implications. Integration of these biomarkers into routine clinical 
assessment may improve treatment personalization and risk stratification. 
Validation in larger, prospective cohorts is warranted.

BACKGROUND: Epigenetic clocks, estimated via DNA methylation (DNAm), reflect 
individuals' biological aging in multiple tissues and are associated with 
age-related diseases, but their functional role in colorectal cancer (CRC), an 
age-associated disease, remains unconclusive. DNAm in tumor tissues exclusively 
exhibits cancerization with expansion of a stem cell pool, leading to the lowest 
DNAm age; this raises a question about its cancer predictability. Thus, the DNAm 
aging marker in pre-diagnostic peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) may provide 
key information on CRC etiology and prevention. We aim to examine pre-diagnostic 
epigenetic makers for aging in PBLs in association with CRC development and risk 
modification by lifestyles.
METHODS: Using data from a large cohort study of white postmenopausal women, we 
examined biological aging status in PBLs via three well-established epigenetic 
clocks-Horvath's, Hannum's and Levine's-and prospectively evaluated CRC 
development in relation to the aging markers and risk modification by lifestyle 
factors.
RESULTS: The epigenetic clocks strongly correlated with chronological age, and 
older DNAm age and age acceleration were significantly associated with increased 
risk for CRC. Women with bilateral oophorectomy before natural menopause had 
substantially higher risk for CRC development when they also had epigenetically 
accelerated aging phenotypes. Among women who maintained healthy dietary 
patterns, no apparently higher risk was found in those with accelerated aging 
compared with those with decelerated aging.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings contribute to better understanding of the role of a 
pre-diagnostic epigenetic aging biomarker and its interplay with lifestyles in 
CRC carcinogenesis, informing risk stratification strategies for aged 
individuals.

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is one of the most common tumors of the urinary 
system, and its outcomes vary widely among individuals, primarily due to 
different molecular characteristics. Both 5-methylcytosine (m5C) methylation and 
long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play crucial roles in the epigenetics of RCC and 
may serve as biomarkers for predicting prognosis. Clinical information and 
transcriptome data of patients with RCC were extracted from the The Cancer 
Genome Atlas database. Using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator 
analysis and multivariate Cox regression, m5C-related lncRNAs were filtered. We 
then built a prognostic prediction model based on m5C-related lncRNAs. The model 
was analyzed for its predictive role in overall survival (OS) and response to 
targeted and immunotherapeutic treatments. We selected 3 lncRNAs, HM13-IT1, 
COLCA1, and AC010285.3, to construct a predictive model that categorizes 
patients into high-risk and low-risk groups. The results indicated that the 
high-risk group exhibited a significantly poorer OS than the low-risk group, and 
upon validation, it was identified as an independent risk factor. Through gene 
ontology enrichment analysis, this model was found to be closely associated with 
tumor immune function. The high-risk group showed higher tumor mutation burden 
and tumor immune dysfunction and exclusion scores, suggesting poorer response to 
immunotherapy. Additionally, the high-risk group exhibited reduced 
responsiveness to sorafenib. The predictive model for RCC can accurately 
forecast the prognosis of RCC, offering new tools for personalized diagnosis and 
treatment of individual patients.

BACKGROUND: Ageing is a heterogeneous process, which is associated with 
heterogeneous resilience in older people. Cancer surgery and treatment may be 
associated with accelerated ageing in some older people; studying this process 
will improve understanding to enable treatments to prevent adverse effects on 
physical and cognitive function.
METHODS: This study will recruit 172 participants aged 65 years and older 
scheduled to undergo elective colorectal surgery for cancer from two hospital 
sites (Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and University Hospitals 
Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust). Assessments will be performed preoperatively, 
days 1-3 postoperatively, 30 days postoperatively, and 90 days postoperatively. 
These will include in-depth clinical phenotyping including handgrip strength, 
Short Physical Performance Battery, muscle ultrasound, cognitive tests, 
Electroencephalography, questionnaires including quality of life, and physical 
activity using remote devices. Serial blood and stool specimens will be 
collected across timepoints to measure underlying hallmarks of ageing including 
inflammation, dysbiosis, macroautophagy, cellular senescence, epigenetic 
alterations, mitochondrial dysfunction, and stem cell exhaustion. A machine 
learning approach will be utilised to evaluate the associations between 
trajectories in clinical and physiological parameters and fundamental biological 
processes.
DISCUSSION: This study represents an exciting collaboration between clinicians, 
fundamental scientists, and experts in machine learning. It offers the 
opportunity to characterise and understand complex pathways to enable future 
clinical trials directed towards the prevention of accelerated ageing through a 
stratified medicine approach.

BACKGROUND: Ageing is a multifactorial process closely associated with increased 
risk of chronic diseases. While epigenetic clocks have advanced ageing research, 
most rely on isolated CpG sites, limiting biological interpretability. We 
developed PathwayAge, a biologically informed model that captures coordinated 
methylation changes at the pathway level, providing interpretable insights into 
ageing biology and disease mechanisms.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study using genome-wide DNA methylation 
data from 10,615 individuals across 19 cohorts and 3413 Han Chinese 
participants, along with transcriptomic data from 3384 samples. A two-stage 
machine learning model aggregated CpG sites into GO or KEGG pathway-level 
features to predict chronological age. Model accuracy was assessed using mean 
absolute error (MAE) and Pearson correlation (Rho). Age acceleration residuals 
(AgeAcc) were computed and tested for associations with nine diseases using 
non-parametric statistics.
FINDINGS: PathwayAge achieved high predictive accuracy (Rho = 0.977, MAE = 
2.350) in cross-validation and across 15 independent blood-based validation 
cohorts (Rho = 0.677-0.979, MAE = 2.113-6.837), including a Chinese population 
(Rho = 0.972, MAE = 2.302). Compared to established clocks, PathwayAge showed 
improved performance in both age estimation and disease association analyses. 
Significant AgeAcc differences were observed across nine diseases, with 
disease-specific pathways confirmed by permutation tests (P < 0.02). Top 
pathways implicated in ageing included autophagy, cell adhesion, synaptic 
signalling, and metabolic regulation. GO-based clustering revealed consistent 
ageing signatures across disease categories, including neuropsychiatric, immune, 
metabolic, and cancer-related conditions. Cross-omics validation using 
transcriptomic data further supported the model's biological relevance (Rho = 
0.70, MAE = 7.21).
INTERPRETATION: PathwayAge represents an interpretable, biologically grounded 
framework for estimating epigenetic age. By integrating pathway-level 
methylation signals, it uncovers mechanistic links between ageing and disease, 
with potential applications in biomarker development and precision ageing 
medicine.

Aberrant DNA methylation (DNAm) is the most well-defined epigenetic hallmark in 
gastric cancer (GC), which may be associated with a variety of risk factors 
exposure. In this study, leveraging the multi-omics data of Genome-wide 
association studies (GWAS), methylation quantitative trait locus (mQTL) and 
expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) collected from The Cancer Genome 
Atlas (TCGA), Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project and Gene Expression 
Omnibus (GEO) database, a joint analysis of cox proportional hazard regression 
and Summary-data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) analysis were adapted to 
investigate the causal associations of DNAm, gene expression and the GC 
prognosis. The results showed the causal association of hypermethylation of 
cg16007185, down-regulation of TMX1, and poorer prognosis of GC patients. 
Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis revealed that exposure to PCB-99, a type 
of polychlorinated biphenyl, might lead to the hypermethylation of cg16007185. 
Mediation analysis showed the borderline mediation role of TMX1 in the 
association between cg16007185 and GC survival, with an indirect effect (IE) of 
5.24% (P = 0.102). Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) and enrichment 
analysis predicted that TMX1 was involved in the cell proliferation pathway. In 
vitro experiments validated that promoter hypomethylation could promote the TMX1 
expression, which inhibited the proliferation and metastatic ability of GC 
cells. Overall, our results suggest that the hypermethylation of cg16007185, a 
result of PCB-99 exposure, may promote the poor prognosis of GC patients by 
decreasing the TMX1 expression.

This Special Issue contains 7 contributions elaborated in the context of the 
workshop ""Frontiers in Cancer, Obesity and metabolism"" organized by the Journal 
of Physiology and Biochemistry (Pamplona, Spain, 2022). It contains basic, 
translational and epidemiological research that sheds light in our understanding 
of the molecular mechanisms underlying how the excess of adipose tissue in 
obesity promotes tumor growth and progression, and highlights the role of 
nutrition in preventing tumor development and improving treatment outcomes in 
cancer patients with obesity and related comorbidities. Two review articles and 
one systematic review are included in this special issue, which describe the 
effects of nutrient deprivation that potentially enhance cancer immunotherapy, 
reveal the importance of the glucose transporter GLUT12 in obesity and cancer, 
and analyze recently described molecular mechanisms that connect obesity and the 
development of different types of cancer. Additionally, four original articles 
demonstrate a metabolic inflammatory pathway in patients with obesity in which 
dysfunctional adipose tissue alters the tumor microenvironment favoring tumor 
progression, offers mechanistic support for exploring low-fat ketogenic diets as 
adjuvant therapy in obesity-related breast cancer prevention or therapy by 
linking nutritional ketosis to epigenetic regulation of cancer‑related genes, 
indicate the use of genes related to amino acid metabolism as prognostic 
biomarkers in breast cancer, and associate a moderate adherence to a 
dietary-based diabetes-risk score to a lower risk of breast cancer among 
premenopausal women and women with low body mass index. Globally, the articles 
included in this special issue contribute to better understand the molecular 
mechanisms beyond nutritional aspects linked to obesity and cancer development.

Inorganic arsenic (As3+) is a well-established human carcinogen, yet the 
molecular mechanisms underlying its oncogenic potential remain incompletely 
understood. Here, we show that exposure to environmentally relevant 
concentrations of As³⁺ disrupts chromatin architectures in human bronchial 
epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) by discordantly regulating two key repressive histone 
modifications: histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) and H3K9me3. 
Chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIP-seq) reveals a genome-wide 
gain of H3K27me3 and a marked loss of H3K9me3 following As³⁺ treatment. 
Mechanistically, As3+ downregulates PALI1, an essential accessory subunit of the 
polycomb repressive complex 2.1 (PRC2.1), which uniquely coordinates H3K27me3 
and H3K9me3 deposition via EZH2 and G9a, respectively. Loss of PALI1 impairs 
this dual repression mechanism, leading to widespread chromatin deregulation. 
Gene ontological analysis reveals that regions with diminished H3K9me3 in 
As³⁺-treated cells are enriched in pathways related to PRC2 activity, ribosomal 
biogenesis, stemness-associated transcription factors, xenobiotic metabolism 
(phases I and II), and GPCR signaling. Notably, these regions also include 
LINE-1 retrotransposons, whose de-repression is known to drive genomic 
instability-a hallmark of cancer. Given PALI1's potential tumor-suppressive role 
in lung, breast, and colon cancers, and other malignancies, its suppression by 
As³⁺ likely contributes to carcinogenesis through epigenetic reprogramming, 
genome destabilization, and activation of oncogenic transcriptional programs. 
These findings reveal a novel mechanism of As³⁺-induced epigenetic dysregulation 
and highlight the central role of histone modifications in environmental 
carcinogenesis.

BACKGROUND: Smoking is a well-established risk factor for colorectal cancer 
(CRC) development. However, the reliability of DNA methylation-based smoking 
signatures in predicting smoking status and their prognostic value in CRC remain 
unclear, particularly across different biological sample types.
RESULTS: Five previously validated methylation-based smoking signatures were 
analyzed in 2237 CRC patients with blood-derived DNA and 2273 patients with 
tumor tissue-derived DNA. Blood-derived signatures showed strong correlations 
with self-reported smoking status, effectively differentiating current smokers 
from never smokers (all p < 0.0001), with excellent discriminative ability 
(median area under the receiver operating characteristic curve: 0.94). In 
contrast, tumor tissue-derived signatures exhibited much weaker associations 
with smoking status. Among non-metastatic CRC patients, blood-derived 
methylation signatures were significantly associated with increased risks of 
all-cause and non-CRC-related mortality, but not with CRC-specific mortality. 
Conversely, two tumor tissue-derived signatures demonstrated stronger 
associations with CRC-specific mortality compared to blood-derived signatures.
CONCLUSIONS: Blood-derived methylation-based smoking signatures are robust 
indicators for smoking exposure and are associated with increased mortality risk 
among non-metastatic CRC patients. When applied to tumor tissue, signatures 
showed stronger associations with CRC-specific mortality.

Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is a heterogeneous malignancy with distinct 
histological subtypes, and DNA methylation has emerged as a promising biomarker 
for early detection. However, the role of methylation patterns in EOC 
heterogeneity and prognosis remains unclear. In this study, genome-wide 
association studies (GWAS) data from the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium 
(OCAC) and Methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTL) data from the Genetics of 
DNA Methylation Consortium (GoDMC) were analysed using two-sample Mendelian 
randomization (MR). We investigated the genetic effects of CpG methylation on 
the risk and prognosis of five major EOC histotypes. To further explore the 
mechanisms by which DNA methylation affects EOC outcomes, we performed mediation 
analysis to evaluate the role of immunophenotypes. Our analysis identified 94 
CpG sites associated with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), 9 of which 
were linked to prognosis. Additional significant associations were found for 
clear cell, low-grade serous, endometrioid, and mucinous subtypes. 
Hypomethylation at specific CpG sites was linked to increased EOC risk and 
shorter survival. Mediation analysis revealed significant interactions between 
CpG methylation and immunophenotypes, suggesting that immune modulation mediates 
the effects of DNA methylation on EOC outcomes. These results provide novel 
insights into the importance of epigenetic and immune-related factors in EOC 
pathogenesis.

The pathogenicity of Helicobacter pylori infection is a well-documented risk 
factor for gastric ailments such as ulcer and cancer. However, the molecular 
mechanisms that underlie its pathogenic effects are only partially understood. 
To address the research gap, this study utilizes a comprehensive bioinformatic 
approach to identify key microRNAs (miRNAs) that target high-risk genes 
associated with H. pylori at an epigenetic level. The miRNAs in question, 
including hsa-mir-539, hsa-mir-361, hsa-mir-203a, hsa-mir-7-1, hsa-let-7f-1, 
hsa-mir-133a-1, and hsa-mir-186, were validated through rigorous database 
searches and cross-referencing. By curating the miRNet and other miRNA 
platforms, the study uncovered intricate regulatory networks between these 
miRNAs and transcription factors (TFs) such as androgen receptor (AR), BCL6, and 
GATA1. These interactions play a crucial role in inflammatory and carcinogenic 
pathways. The functional annotation of the miRNAs highlights their significant 
roles in essential biological processes and pathways that are relevant to H. 
pylori infection and gastric cancer progression. Overall, this integrated 
analysis provides critical insights into the molecular landscape of H. 
pylori-induced ulceration and carcinogenesis. This information may offer 
potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for future research and clinical 
applications in managing gut health.

BACKGROUND: Sanguisorba officinalis L. (S.L.), a traditional Chinese medicine 
from the Rosaceae family, is recognized for its rich content of triterpenoids, 
which are known for their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-tumor 
properties. Although its traditional uses and biological activities are well 
known, its role in preventing colon cancer and the underlying mechanisms remain 
unclear. This study aims to elucidate the preventive mechanisms of triterpenoids 
in both raw (TR) and processed (TP) forms of S.L. against colon cancer.
METHODS: The AOM/DSS-induced mouse model of colon cancer was employed to 
elucidate the mechanism underlying the preventive effects of Sanguisorba 
officinalis L. triterpenoids (ST) against colon cancer. A comprehensive suite of 
techniques, including hematoxylin-eosin staining (H&E), immunohistochemistry 
(IHC), TUNEL staining, Western blotting (WB), and DNA methylation analysis, was 
utilized to investigate the preventive effects of ST on colon cancer. The main 
active compounds were identified using UPLC-Q-TOF-MS, and potential active 
compounds were screened through network pharmacology and molecular docking. The 
stability of the protein-ligand complexes was further assessed using molecular 
dynamics simulations.
RESULTS: In vivo experiments, treatment with ST significantly improved the 
clinical manifestations, Disease Activity Index (DAI) scores, and pathological 
lesions associated with colon cancer, with all drug administration groups 
outperforming the model group. Additionally, ST markedly enhanced gut barrier 
function by downregulating the levels of TNF-α, p65, COX-2, and iNOS. 
Furthermore, ST dramatically ameliorated the colonic immune-inflammatory state, 
which was associated with decreased expression of proliferative proteins and 
increased expression of apoptotic proteins. Among the identified triterpenoids, 
compound 27 May be the main active compound. Notably, compound 27 can form a 
stable complex with TNF-α.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that TP has a more pronounced colon cancer 
prevention effect than TR. TP play a role in preventing colon cancer by 
down-regulating TNF-α and thereby inhibiting the NF-κB signaling pathway. This 
research not only fills the mechanism gap of S.L. in the field of colon cancer 
prevention, but also provides methodological support and theoretical foundation 
for its transition from traditional Chinese medicine to clinical practice 
through the integration of multi-disciplinary technologies and the verification 
of precise targets.

BACKGROUND: Epigenetic alterations are crucial in gastric cancer (GC) 
development and progression. As these modifications are reversible, targeting 
them may offer preventive and therapeutic benefits. Origanum onites L. essential 
oil (OOEO) has demonstrated anticancer properties in various cancers, but its 
epigenetic effects in GC remain unexplored.
METHODS: OOEO was extracted by water distillation, and its effects on gastric 
adenocarcinoma (AGS) and normal gastric epithelial (GES-1) cells were evaluated. 
Cytotoxicity was assessed via WST-8 assay, apoptosis by Annexin V staining, DNA 
damage by γ-H2AX test, and epigenetic modifications by methylation-specific PCR 
and histone modification analysis.
RESULTS: Compared to GES-1 cells, OOEO exhibited cytotoxic activity even at 
lower concentrations in AGS cells. OOEO treatment induced apoptosis and DNA 
double-strand breaks and arrested cell cycle at S and G2/M phases compared to 
the untreated group. OOEO also caused a decrease in promoter methylation of LOX, 
TIMP3, CDH1 and RARB genes and was found to globally alter 16 histone 
modifications in AGS cells and 19 histone modifications in GES-1 cells. OOEO 
contributed to the reorganization of H3K9ac modification in the promoters of 
CDKN1A, MYC, RUNX3, RASSF1 and CDH1 genes and H3K27me3 modification in the 
promoters of CDKN1A and MYC genes.
CONCLUSION: OOEO exhibits epigenetic regulatory properties that may contribute 
to GC prevention and treatment. Its potential in neoadjuvant or combinatory 
therapies warrants further investigation.

BACKGROUND: Metastatic tumors pose clinical treatment challenges due to their 
high adaptability to diverse environments. The cooperation of epigenetic 
modifications and metabolic adaptations enables tumor cells to dynamically 
adjust for survival in variable environments, which is crucial for tumor 
metastasis and worth exploring in depth.
METHODS: RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing, transmission electron microscopy 
photograph and GFP-mCherry-LC3 fluorescence imaging were employed to reveal the 
role of insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 3 (IGF2BP3) in 
triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. Then, in the presence of rapamycin, 
further experiments showed that IGF2BP3's role in TNBC metastasis was 
autophagy-mediated. Methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing, luciferase 
assays and co-immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry showed that IGF2BP3 promoted 
mRNA translation initiation in an N6-methyladenosine (m6A)-dependent manner.
RESULTS: We found that IGF2BP3 could link epigenetic modification and metabolic 
adaptation to promote autophagy-mediated TNBC metastasis. As an m6A binding 
protein that is specifically highly expressed in TNBC, IGF2BP3 could bind to the 
m6A motif of c-Met mRNA, regulating autophagy-mediated epithelial-to-mesenchymal 
transition via the c-Met/PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Moreover, IGF2BP3 recruited 
eIF4G2 as a collaborator, promoting c-Met protein expression by facilitating 
m6A-dependent and cap-independent mRNA translation initiation, rather than 
affecting mRNA stability.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study expands the understanding of IGF2BP3's role in TNBC 
metastasis by establishing its function in regulating autophagy. Notably, 
IGF2BP3 could bind to the m6A motif on the 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) 
of c-Met mRNA to facilitate its translation in a cap-independent manner.

Low-grade glioma (LGG) frequently occurring in children and adolescents. 
Upstream frameshift protein 1 (UPF1) is involved in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay 
(NMD), in LGG progression and tumor invasion remains unclear. Data from The 
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and GTEx were analyzed to compare UPF1 expression in 
normal and cancer tissues. Protein levels were studied using the Human Protein 
Atlas (HPA). Gene enrichment analyses were performed, alongside genetic, 
methylation, immune infiltration, and clinicopathological evaluations. 
Kaplan-Meier (KM) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses 
assessed UPF1's prognostic value, and a nomogram for survival prediction was 
developed. UPF1 mRNA and protein levels were significantly higher in LGG tissues 
(P < 0.05). UPF1 expression was linked to tumor microenvironment and immune 
cell-related pathways. Genetic alterations in UPF1 impacted overall survival 
(OS), rather than disease-free survival. DNA methylation patterns of UPF1 had 
significant prognostic value. UPF1 expression level was correlated with immune 
cell infiltration (e.g., B cells, CD4 + T cells, macrophages). High UPF1 
expression, advanced grade, gene mutations, older age, and unfavorable treatment 
outcomes were associated with poor OS (P < 0.05). The nomogram based on six risk 
factors exhibited moderate accuracy (AUC1-year = 0.680). UPF1 is a potential 
biomarker for tumor immune infiltration and prognosis in LGG patients.

Local increases in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) caused by specific 
adenylyl cyclases (ACs) can selectively modulate related proteins. AC-selective 
drugs have an advantage in side effect control, and the specific AC may finally 
be considered as a therapeutic target. We show that adenylyl cyclase 4 (ADCY4), 
which is silenced by DNA methylation and is critical for breast cancer (BC) 
patient survival, plays essential roles in anti-tumor effects in BC cells. DNA 
methyltransferase inhibitor and histone deacetylase inhibitor can restore ADCY4 
mRNA expression in ADCY4-silenced BC cells. ADCY4 directly affects BC cell 
proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, and metastasis. Mechanistically, ADCY4 
converts ATP to cAMP and activates cAMP/PKA signaling, leading to a decrease in 
the phosphorylation level of downstream FAK/AKT and ERK signaling and creating a 
suppression environment for cell survival. Ectopic ADCY4 inhibits BC growth, 
which is blocked by cAMP inhibition, activating AKT and ERK. The present study 
provides evidence that human BC relies upon this epigenetic silenced 
ADCY4-associated ATP-cAMP loop for phosphorylation and activation of FAK/AKT and 
ERK signaling. Also, ADCY4 increases BC cell chemosensitivity to paclitaxel. The 
observations demonstrates that ADCY4 is a significant tumor suppressor and that 
loss of ADCY4 functions by DNA methylation hampers cAMP signaling and triggers 
FAK/AKT and ERK signaling during breast tumorigenesis.

Peptidylprolyl isomerase A (PPIA) is a key molecule involved in various 
biological functions and has been implicated in multiple diseases. However, the 
biological significance of PPIA in pan-cancer remains unclear. We assessed the 
pan-cancer expression, prognostic value, and biological functions of PPIA 
through multiple databases and multidimensional analysis. We also investigated 
the correlation of PPIA with the immune microenvironment, epigenetic 
modifications, and drug sensitivity. Expression validation was performed using 
Western Blot (WB) and quantitative PCR (qPCR). PPIA was found to be highly 
expressed in most cancers and identified as a prognostic risk factor. The 
expression of PPIA in most cancers showed significant correlations with immune 
cell infiltration, major histocompatibility complex, immune checkpoints, tumor 
mutation burden, microsatellite instability, RNA modifications (including m1A, 
m5C, m6A), and DNA methylation sites. It was widely enriched in pathways such as 
Neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, Calcium signaling pathway, and cAMP 
signaling pathway in the pan-cancer context. PPIA plays a pro-tumor role in 
various cancers and could serve as a potential biomarker for predicting cancer 
prognosis and the efficacy of immunotherapy.

Breast cancer (BC) is a highly prevalent malignancy in women and is often 
resistant to available therapies, calling for urgent investigation of the 
molecular mechanisms underlying its pathogenesis and progression. BC is thought 
to result from a complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors. 
Among key factors, chronic stress has been associated with worse cancer outcomes 
and can profoundly impact the epigenome. However, both stress and BC phenotypes 
are complex and heterogeneous, making studies that examine their molecular links 
challenging. Despite their heterogeneity, stressors trigger a neuroendocrine 
response that in humans culminates in the release of cortisol, a highly 
lipophilic hormone that traverses essentially every cell and induces widespread 
genomic effects. Modeling such effects at the epigenetic level, here we examine 
whether cellular DNA methylation (DNAm) markers of chronic stress - derived from 
human fibroblasts undergoing prolonged exposure to physiological stress cortisol 
levels - distinguish BC phenotypes in two independent human cohorts. Our results 
show that methylomic signatures of stress are consistently higher in tumor 
samples as compared to normal samples and in more advanced tumor stages and 
grades. Follow-up analyses further identify specific DNAm sites driving these 
associations, which are significantly enriched for cell adhesion pathways in 
both cohorts. These findings provide insights into the molecular mechanisms 
linking stress with BC and a proof-of-concept for utilizing cell model-derived 
disease biomarkers in environmental epigenetics.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) emerges from mutant KRAS-harboring but 
dormant low-grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN). To examine the 
role of oxidative stress, a putative PDAC risk factor, we established an 
organoid-based transformation system. Although the prototypic oxidant H2O2 
induced organoid transformation, its effect was nonmutational and was mediated 
by the oxidant-responsive transcription factor NRF2, which induced the histone 
methyltransferase EZH2. Congruently, nonoxidizing NRF2 activators triggered 
organoid malignant conversion through NRF2 and EZH2, establishing a hitherto 
unknown epigenetic mechanism underlying PanIN-to-PDAC progression. While NRF2 
induced EZH2 gene transcription in mouse and human PDAC, EZH2, a general 
repressor, coactivated transcription of NRF2-encoding NFE2L2 and interacted with 
other transcription factors to induce genes that sustain PDAC metabolic demands. 
The self-amplifying NRF2-EZH2 epigenetic loop also accounted for 
inflammation-driven PanIN-to-PDAC progression in vivo and was upregulated in 
established human PDAC, whose malignancy was maintained by NRF2 binding to the 
EZH2 promoter.

Breast cancer is characterized by genetic and epigenetic deregulations, leading 
to aberrant expression of tissue-specific genes that are normally silent in 
healthy breast tissue. Our previous work identified the embryonic stem 
cell-specific gene DNMT3B, a de novo DNA methyltransferase, as aberrantly 
activated in breast cancer, correlating with aggressive tumour behaviour and 
high relapse risk, regardless of molecular subtype. Through integrative 
bioinformatic analyses of DNA methylation and transcriptomic data, we identified 
154 genes downregulated via DNMT3B-driven promoter hypermethylation, many of 
which are associated with high relapse risk. Notably, the tumour suppressor gene 
GATA3 emerged as a primary target of functional inactivation through either 
loss-of-function mutations or DNMT3B-controlled hypermethylation, in a mutually 
exclusive manner. Both mechanisms of GATA3 inactivation were associated with 
similar molecular signatures linked to tumour progression, increased malignancy, 
and poorer prognosis. However, distinct differences were observed, with immune- 
and inflammation-related genes enriched in GATA3 hypermethylation cases but 
depleted in mutation-driven silencing. Additionally, our analysis uncovered 
other potential tumour suppressor genes epigenetically repressed in aggressive 
breast cancers. These findings underscore a broader role of GATA3 inactivation 
beyond genetic alterations and suggest therapeutic opportunities to target 
epigenetically silenced tumour suppressors in aggressive breast tumours.

Tumor development is mainly marked by the gradual transformation of cells that 
acquire capacities such as sustained growth signaling, evasion of growth 
suppression, resistance to cell death, and induction of angiogenesis, achieving 
replicative immortality and activating invasion and metastasis. How different 
epigenetic alterations like m1A, m5C, and m6A contribute to tumor development is 
a field that still needs to be investigated. The immune modulators, CD70, CD80, 
and TIGIT, mainly regulate T-cell activation and consequently the immune evasion 
of tumors. Here, we explored the presence and the potential consequences of RNA 
modifications in these regulators in pan-cancer. Our findings highlight the 
critical role of the m6A, m5C, and m1A in regulating CD70, CD80, and TIGIT 
across multiple solid tumors. By combining epitranscriptomics data with 
functional enrichment and survival modeling, we show that RNA modification 
enzymes not only modulate immune-related gene expression but also serve as 
potential biomarkers for patient prognosis. By constructing a robust four-gene 
prognostic signature involving YTHDF3, RBM15B, IGF2BP2, and TRMT61A, we 
demonstrate that RNA modification profiles can accurately stratify patients into 
risk groups with distinct overall survival outcomes. The performance of this 
model across eight cancer types underscores the translational promise of 
epitranscriptomic markers in both mechanistic understanding and personalized 
oncology. Altogether, our study bridges the gap between the mechanistic 
regulation of immune checkpoints and their clinical utility, offering novel 
insights into how the epitranscriptome can be leveraged to improve cancer 
prognosis and potentially enhance immunotherapeutic strategies.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The methylation of the hypermethylated oncological region 
(THOR) of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) may forecast tumour 
aggressiveness. This pilot study aimed to evaluate THOR methylation as a 
potential biomarker for recurrence/malignant transformation in salivary gland 
pleomorphic adenomas (PA).
METHODS: THOR methylation was assessed by quantitative pyrosequencing in 96 
parotid tissue samples (benign and malignant), including non-neoplastic parotid 
tissue, PA, recurrent PA (rPA), and carcinomas, along with their adjacent 
tissues. TERT promoter mutations (TPMs) were analysed by Sanger sequencing.
RESULTS: THOR methylation significantly differed across the seven groups. 
Malignant tissues showed higher THOR methylation than non-neoplastic tissues, 
whereas benign tumours showed no significant difference from non-neoplastic 
tissue. THOR methylation in rPA was closer to carcinoma than to normal tissue, 
similar in rPA and tissues adjacent to rPA, and higher in tissues adjacent to 
carcinomas than in non-neoplastic tissues. A subset of PA-adjacent tissues 
showed epigenetic alterations, suggesting an increased risk of recurrence or 
malignant transformation (5-15%). No TPMs were detected.
CONCLUSIONS: THOR methylation may add information to differentiate normal from 
carcinogenic tissues and, as such, may be included in a biomarkers panel. 
Epigenetic alterations in PA-adjacent tissues with normal histology highlight 
the need for improved diagnostic markers.

The origin of mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCNs) remains a major challenge in 
hepato-pancreato-biliary pathology. These cystic tumors are defined by their 
mucinous epithelium and ovarian-like stroma, with an estimated 10% risk of 
progression to invasive carcinoma. The origin of the ovarian-like stroma remains 
a subject of debate. In this study, we conducted immunohistochemical profiling, 
targeted DNA sequencing, and genome-wide DNA methylation analysis on a cohort of 
15 pancreatic MCNs (MCN-P) and six hepatic MCNs (MCN-L). Using 
immunohistochemistry and targeted DNA sequencing, we unequivocally established 
the diagnosis of MCN. Unsupervised DNA methylation profile analysis of reference 
classes of pancreatic neoplasms (11 entities and normal pancreatic tissue from 
224 unique samples) revealed that MCN-P predominantly forms a distinct group. In 
the DNA methylation landscape of liver tumors, encompassing five tumor types and 
normal bile duct tissue from 136 unique samples, MCN-L demonstrated a specific 
methylation profile when compared with all other entities. Furthermore, within 
the DNA methylation landscape of ovarian tumors - featuring five tumor types, 
normal Fallopian tube, and normal ovarian tissue from 90 unique samples - we 
found that both MCN-P and MCN-L grouped with mucinous ovarian carcinoma and 
mucinous borderline ovarian tumors (mBOTs). Notably, low-grade MCNs exhibited 
greater DNA methylation similarities to mBOTs, while high-grade or invasive MCNs 
were primarily associated with mucinous ovarian carcinomas. When analyzing all 
samples together (19 tumor types and four normal tissue types, n = 430), MCNs 
similarly grouped with mucinous ovarian tumors and normal ovarian tissue. 
Additionally, in a network analysis of differentially methylated probes, MCN-P 
and MCN-L share significant methylation traits, closely resembling mucinous 
ovarian tumors. In conclusion, our findings highlight that MCN-P and MCN-L are 
distinct entities in the landscape of pancreatic and hepatic tumors and show DNA 
methylation profile similarities with mucinous ovarian tumors, suggesting a 
potential common origin. © 2025 The Author(s). The Journal of Pathology

Oral and oropharyngeal cancers, caused by persistent human papillomavirus (HPV), 
have recently increased. Diagnostic methods often fail to assess precancerous 
lesion risk, delaying oral cancer diagnosis. New molecular biomarkers, 
particularly DNA methylation, are sought to better stratify patients' risk. The 
PreCursor-M+ (Fujirebio, Tokyo, Japan), which analyze hypermethylation of the 
two onco-suppressor FAM19A4 and miR124-2 in cervical samples from high-risk 
HPV-positive women, was used to assess the methylation level of 111 oral samples 
distinguished in oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC), oral potentially 
malignant disorders (OPMD) benign lesions (BL), and no lesions (NL). HPV was 
detected by INNO-LiPA HPV Genotyping Extra II (Fujirebio, Tokyo, Japan). 
Hypermethylation was correlated with the severity of the diagnosis. A positive 
result was more common in OSCC (p < 0.0001). HPV positivity correlated with 
hypermethylation in OSCCs (32.4%, p = 0.0006), although statistical significance 
was also found in HPV-negatives (p = 0.0007). HPV16-positive OSCC showed higher 
methylation. Targets' methylation increased from the NL to the BL, OPMD and 
OSCCs groups. The methylation status of FAM19A4 and miR-124-2 may play an 
important role in the progression of oral cancer and, consequently, in 
determining the prognosis of patients with OPMD, for whom hypermethylation would 
suggest the need for close monitoring. Furthermore, HPV16's association with 
hypermethylation suggests its involvement in oral carcinogenesis. To confirm 
these results and gain further insight into HPV's role in methylation 
impairment, the sample size will be increased.

Even with today's sophisticated medical procedures, the two top causes of death 
worldwide continue to be cancer and coronary artery disease (CAD). Compared to 
patients with other malignancies, people with acute leukemia (AL) have a higher 
incidence of congestive heart failure. It is yet unknown how recently discovered 
AL and CAD are related. Recent research highlights P53's critical role as a 
""gatekeeper"" of cardiac function, facilitating the repair of double-strand DNA 
breaks. Mutations in TP53 lead to impaired DNA repair, increased cardiomyocyte 
apoptosis following ischemia, and ultimately contribute to cardiac dysfunction. 
The current study aims to investigate epigenetic regulators' role in CD4+ T 
helper cells (TH) extracted from Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) of 
Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) and Acute Leukemia (AL) patients, potentially 
elucidating their connection. Our experimental data revealed that reduced P53 
gene expression correlated with increased Histone (H3) trimethylation on Lysine 
residue 27 (K27), DNA methylation, and R-loop frequencies, alongside decreased 
Histone (H3) trimethylation on Lysine residue 4 (K4) and m6A methylation, 
contributing to diminished TH1-ness in CAD and AL patients. Through P53 
depletion and overexpression in CD4+TH cells of Normal subjects, CAD, and AL 
patients, we observed that P53 overexpression reversed these epigenetic and 
epitranscriptomic modifications. Specifically, in immunologically challenged 
CD4+TH cells of CAD and AL patients, P53 overexpression led to decreased K27 
trimethylation, DNA methylation, and R-loop frequencies, coupled with increased 
K4 trimethylation and m6A methylation, subsequently upregulating mRNA levels of 
TH1-associated genes, promoting protective immunity. Therefore, a thorough 
understanding of the intricate relationship between CAD and AL may improve 
prevention, prompt detection, and appropriate treatment of those diseases.

Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), a polymer widely used in consumer products, 
has recently been implicated in cancer progression, though its mechanistic 
underpinnings remain elusive. This multidisciplinary study systematically 
investigates PET's carcinogenic mechanisms by integrating network toxicology, 
machine learning, molecular docking simulations, single-cell RNA sequencing, and 
spatial transcriptomics. We identified PET-associated oncogenic targets and 
conducted pan-cancer expression profiling with prognostic analyses of 22 core 
genes, subsequently employing machine learning algorithms to quantify their 
prognostic weights across malignancies. Molecular docking revealed six 
high-affinity PET-binding targets (PIK3CA, TOP2A, PARP1, SRC, EP300, CREBBP; 
binding energies <-6.0 kcal/mol) predominantly expressed in T-cells and 
phagocytic cells, with significant infiltration into malignant tumor regions. 
Mechanistically, PET exposure may drive carcinogenesis through three synergistic 
pathways: dysregulation of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling axis via PIK3CA, 
compromised DNA repair mechanisms through TOP2A/PARP1 interactions, and 
epigenetic reprogramming mediated by the EP300/CREBBP transcriptional complex. 
These molecular perturbations collectively induce genomic instability, immune 
dysregulation, and tumor evolution by disrupting cellular homeostasis, DNA 
integrity maintenance, and chromatin remodeling processes. Finally, we confirmed 
that PET exposure promotes tumor cell proliferation by experiments such as clone 
formation and western blotting, that the effect increases with exposure 
concentration, and that PET exposure increases TOP2A protein levels. Our 
findings not only delineate PET's role in tumorigenesis but also establish a 
computational-experimental framework for environmental toxicant evaluation. This 
work provides critical insights for developing prevention strategies against 
pollutant-driven malignancies, bridging molecular toxicology with clinical 
cancer biology.

BACKGROUND: DNA methylation alteration is a common event during the 
carcinogenesis and progression of endometrial cancer (EC). Our study aimed to 
investigate the value of DNA methylation-related genes in predicting the 
prognosis and immunotherapy response for EC patients.
METHODS: The clinical information and the expression of DNA methylation-related 
genes of 544 endometrial cancers were obtained from the Cancer Genome Atlas 
(TCGA) database. The univariate Cox regression analysis and the LASSO regression 
analysis were subsequently used to identify prognosis-related methylation 
regulators and construct a risk model. Gene functional enrichment analysis, 
immune infiltration analysis, drug sensitivity analysis, and molecular feature 
analysis were performed in different subgroups.
RESULTS: 25 methylation-Related gene signatures were found in EC patients and 
are correlated to tumor differentiation and tumor metastasis. By LASSO-Cox 
regression analyses, a recurrence prediction model and a prognostic-related 
model were constructed based on methylation-related genes in the TCGA training 
cohort. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) values of the recurrence prediction model 
were 0.671, 0.708, and 0.689 for 1-, 3-, and 5-year time points, respectively, 
while those of the prognostic model were 0.731, 0.717, and 0.725. The 
relationship of risk score (RS) with ER/PR-related genes, immune checkpoint 
expressions, and IC50s of paclitaxel, cisplatin, tamoxifen, and cetuximab was 
investigated. The results showed That patients in the low-risk group are more 
effective in cetuximab and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: The model based on the methylation-related genes showed promising 
outcomes in predicting the recurrence and treatment response of EC. The patients 
with high-risk scores showed a poorer prognosis and may benefit more from the 
treatment of cetuximab or immune checkpoint inhibitors.

OBJECTIVES: Clinical trials are needed to advance interventions such as 
chemoprevention that have potential to reduce the risk of malignant 
transformation in individuals with oral potentially malignant disorders. We 
explored the perspectives of those screened or invited to join an early phase 
clinical trial (the SAVER trial: Sodium valproate for the epigenetic 
reprogramming of high-risk oral epithelial dysplasia). Our objectives were to 
inform the SAVER trial while it was ongoing and to provide insights for future 
trials and chemoprevention therapy development more broadly.
DESIGN: Qualitative study involving audio-recorded, semistructured interviews. 
Analysis of transcribed interviews drew on thematic approaches.
SETTING: Five UK-based sites involved in SAVER.
PARTICIPANTS: Purposive sample of individuals (n=20) with suspected or diagnosed 
oral epithelial dysplasia (OED) who were approached about SAVER.
RESULTS: Most interviewees readily accepted that OED warranted preventive 
treatment and were positive about the potential of chemoprevention. However, 
they were often concerned about the side effects of the trial medication, and 
together with a dislike of biopsies and a perception that the trial might 
disadvantage treatment, these concerns made some hesitant to participate in 
SAVER. Interviewees indicated that the communication of staff influenced their 
understanding and experience of the trial and identified several opportunities 
for enhancing these aspects.
CONCLUSIONS: In indicating that individuals at risk of malignant transformation 
are accepting of chemoprevention in principle, our findings are supportive of 
future research on chemoprevention for this group. The findings also draw 
attention to the crucial role of communication in recruitment to chemoprevention 
trials. We provide recommendations to support staff during recruitment and 
enhance individuals' experience of the trial.

BACKGROUND: Cancer remains a serious public health problem impeding gains in 
life expectancy. Epigenetic clocks, derived from sets of DNA methylation CpGs 
and mathematical algorithms, have demonstrated a remarkable ability to indicate 
biological aging and age-related health risks. 
Dunedin(P)ace(o)f(A)ging(m)ethylation is a single-timepoint DNA methylation 
clock. It is an aging speedometer rather than a state measure. The association 
between the DunedinPoAm-measured pace of biological aging and cancer risk based 
on a nationally non-institutionalized sample remains to be elucidated. Physical 
activity, a modifiable lifestyle factor, is associated with delayed biological 
aging and lower risks of developing cancer. We hypothesized that 
DunedinPoAm-measured pace of biological aging is positively associated with 
cancer risk, and physical activity moderates this association.
RESULTS: In total, 2,529 participants aged 50 or older from the National Health 
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2002 were included. Weighted 
logistic regression calculating odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals 
(CI) showed that when scaled per 1-SD increase, DunedinPoAm was positively 
associated with cancer risk (OR, 95% CI) (1.21, 1.05-1.39) in the crude model 
and adjusted for age and sex (1.19, 1.01-1.40). Individuals of high DunedinPoAm 
tertile had a 68% (95% CI 1.16-2.43) increase in cancer risk compared with the 
low tertile (P trend < 0.001). As hypothesized, effect modification by physical 
activity was significant (P interaction = 0.013). The association was apparent 
in physically inactive participants (1.52, 1.16-2.00), whereas insignificant in 
physically active individuals (1.08, 0.89-1.32). Exploratory interaction 
analyses for other covariates showed significant effect modification by age 
(> 65 years, 1.38, 1.08-1.77 vs 50-65 years, 1.00, 0.79-1.27).
CONCLUSION: The study supported the hypothesis by demonstrating a positive 
association between the DunedinPoAm-measured pace of biological aging and cancer 
risk and a modulating role of physical activity. Physically inactive individuals 
or participants over 65 years showed increased susceptibility to this 
association. These findings suggest that incorporating the DunedinPoAm-measured 
pace of biological aging into cancer screening strategies may benefit those with 
physically inactive lifestyles and older individuals. Whether physical activity 
can mitigate the increased risk of cancer in individuals with a faster pace of 
biological aging needs to be validated in further interventional cohort studies.

Residual cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) can cause tumour recurrence within a 
narrow margin around the initial tumour resection lesion, increasing the risk of 
post-surgical relapse and incurability. Currently, there are no efficient 
strategies for tracking and eradicating CSCs. Here we propose a nanovaccine 
strategy, called NICER, based on a nanovesicle system integrating CSC-specific 
antigen display and epigenetic nano-regulator encapsulation with a 
dendritic-cell-targeting aptamer, to simultaneously eradicate CSCs and bulk 
tumour cells. Specifically, nanovesicles derived from 
aldehyde-dehydrogenase-overexpressing tumours could serve as integrated antigens 
carrying both CSC-specific antigen and tumour-associated antigen. Epigenetic 
nano-regulator targeting YTH N6-methyladenosine RNA binding protein 1 could 
restrict dendritic cell lysosomal protease activity to modulate the effective 
cross-presentation of integrated antigens via major histocompatibility complex 
class I for immune responses. Overall, NICER represents a broad-spectrum vaccine 
approach against both CSCs and bulk tumours that can significantly inhibit 
postoperative cancer recurrence and metastasis, prolonging survival rates.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Secreted frizzled-related proteins (SFRPs) are antagonists that 
bind Wnt and inhibit signaling through this pathway. Secreted frizzled-related 
proteins are silenced by promoter methylation and cause hyperactivation of the 
Wnt pathway. In this study, the aim was to evaluate the relationship between 
methylation and expression of genes involved in the Wnt signaling pathway and 
the risk of cancer development in inflammatory bowel disease.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The patient group consisted of 20 individuals who were 
diagnosed with left-side ulcerative colitis and underwent surveillance 
colonoscopy; the control group consisted of 15 individuals without symptoms and 
endoscopic pathology who were screened for colorectal cancer. Tissue samples 
were obtained from inflamed and non-inflamed areas of the colon. Methylation and 
gene expression profiles of the Wnt pathway genes APC1A, APC2, SFRP1, SFRP2, 
SFRP4, and SFRP5 were analyzed from DNA and RNA obtained from these tissues.
RESULTS: A significant correlation was found between the methylation status and 
expression of the SFRP4 gene in the proximal colon in the patient group compared 
to controls (P = .018). For the methylation of the APC2 gene, 8 patients were 
methylated (40%), and 12 were unmethylated (60%), while 1 of the controls was 
methylated (6.7%) and 14 were unmethylated (93.3%) (P = .018). There was no 
statistically significant association between methylation, expression, and 
inflammation status for other genes between patients and controls.
CONCLUSION: In ulcerative colitis, inflammation is thought to be associated with 
both increased APC2 methylation and decreased expression findings due to 
decreased SFRP4 methylation in non-inflamed areas. However, more research is 
needed to establish a link with ulcerative colitis-related neoplasia.

BACKGROUND: Hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) is a lung cancer carcinogen. However, 
the genotoxic and mutagenic effects of Cr(VI) in humans at low-to-moderate 
occupational exposure levels are unknown. This study aims to investigate the 
relationship between occupational exposure to Cr(VI) and the presence of 
oxidative damage, genetic and epigenetic alterations.
METHODS: We included 113 Cr(VI) exposed workers in 14 companies and 72 controls 
recruited within the SafeChrom project. Cr(VI) was measured in inhalable dust 
and total chromium in urine (U-Cr) and red blood cells (RBC-Cr). Analysed effect 
biomarkers included urinary 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), micronuclei in 
peripheral blood reticulocytes (MNRET), blood relative mitochondrial DNA copy 
number (mtDNA-cn), relative telomere length (TL), and blood DNA methylation of 
four lung cancer-related genes (F2RL3, LINE-1, MGMT promoter and SEMA4B).
RESULTS: The median inhalable Cr(VI) concentration among the exposed workers was 
0.11 μg/m3 (5th-95th percentile: 0.02-8.44). Exposed workers showed higher 
8-OHdG, TL, and MGMT promoter methylation levels and lower mtDNA-cn and MNRET 
compared with controls. Company-based differences in biomarkers were observed. 
Univariate analysis showed that TL was positively correlated with U-Cr, and 
8-OHdG and MGMT promoter methylation were positively correlated with RBC-Cr. 
Multivariate analyses with adjustment for possible confounders showed higher 
8-OHdG, TL, and MGMT promoter methylation in exposed workers compared with 
controls.
CONCLUSIONS: Low-to-moderate Cr(VI) exposure was associated with higher 
oxidative stress, longer telomeres and epigenetic alterations, changes that 
previously have been linked to lung cancer risk. This study highlights the 
molecular impacts of Cr(VI) exposure, underscoring the importance of reducing 
the exposure to Cr(VI).

Spindlin-1, a multivalent epigenetic reader, is a new target for cancer therapy. 
Beside the anticancer effect, modulation of the recognition of methyl marks of 
histones may impact the immune system, which plays an important role in the 
anticancer strategy of the human organism. Two Spindlin-1 inhibitors (A366, 
MS31) were characterized to differentiate between drug and target-specific 
effects. We performed a comprehensive study regarding the influence of 
Spindlin-1 inhibition on various immune cells. A366 and MS31 showed immune cell 
type-dependent cytotoxicity with IC50 values in the ranges of 37-143 µM and 
11-3122 µM, respectively, macrophages tending to be less susceptible than 
lymphocytes. A366 had only minor effects on M1 polarization, whereas MS31 
shifted the M1 to a M2 phenotype, as shown by regulated cytokines and surface 
marker expression. Both A366 and MS31 weakened the polarization of 
predifferentiated M2 macrophages by reducing surface marker expression, 
cytokines, and inflammatory markers. A366 and MS31 had no effect on activation 
and energy metabolism of CD4+ T cells. Interestingly, 5 µM A366 and 2.5 µM MS31 
clearly prevented B cell activation, as shown by reduced proliferation, 
plasmablast formation, and release of immunoglobulins A and G. Additionally, 
A366 increased energy metabolism in B cells. In conclusion, the inhibition of 
Spindlin-1 had only minor effects on polarization of macrophages and T cell 
proliferation but profoundly prevented B cell activation at low concentrations. 
This suggests that Spindlin-1 inhibitors, while mediating anticancerogenic 
effects, may also suppress the humoral immune response and increase infection 
risk.

BACKGROUND: Epigenetic changes contribute to colorectal cancer (CRC) 
pathogenesis. We investigated whether methylation quantitative trait loci 
(mQTLs) are associated with CRC risk, survival and recurrence.
METHODS: Using a well-characterised Scottish case-control study (6821 CRC cases, 
14,692 controls), we derived 118,982 mQTLs based on the Genetics of DNA 
Methylation Consortium (GoDMC). Association analysis between mQTLs and CRC risk, 
survival and recurrence was performed using logistic regression or Cox models 
respectively. Additionally, colocalisation analysis was performed.
RESULTS: 19 mQTLs within 10 distinct genomic regions were associated with CRC 
risk. Two novel regions were mapped to MDGA2 (p value =  3.0 ×  10-6 ) and 
STARD3 (p value =  5.6 ×  10-6 ). Four regions mapped to POU5F1B, 
POU2AF2 (c11orf53)/POU2AF3 (COLCA2), GREM1 and CABLES2 were previously 
identified. Four regions mapped to PPA2, PANDAR/LAP3P2, POU6F1 and CTIF 
contained SNPs previously identified by CRC GWAS but with SNPs annotated to 
different genes. We found no evidence that any of the 19 mQTLs associated with 
CRC risk influenced survival or recurrence after FDR correction. Colocalisation 
analysis suggested that in three of the ten regions the causal variants were 
shared for methylation and CRC risk.
CONCLUSION: This study adds to the repertoire of CRC genes. However, we found no 
associations between methylation and CRC survival or recurrence.

BACKGROUND: The impact of healthy lifestyles on epigenetic age acceleration 
(EAA) and mortality in middle-aged/ senior populations remains unclear. This 
study investigates associations between lifestyle factors, EAA biomarkers, and 
mortality risk.
METHOD: The 2532 adults of 50 years or older that registered in NHANES between 
1999-2002.This study evaluated compares first- to third-generation epigenetic 
clocks (HannumAge, HorvathAge, PhenoAge, GrimAge2, DunedinPoAm) in predicting 
mortality risk associations between five lifestyle domains (diet, abdominal 
adiposity, physical activity, smoking, alcohol) and EAA were analyzed via 
multivariable regression, with mediation models testing EAA's role in 
lifestyle-mortality relationships.
RESULTS: Survival curves results identified DunedinPoAm, GrimAge2AA, and 
PhenoAgeAA as robust biomarkers of accelerated biological aging, independent of 
chronological age. In multivariable linear regression models, full adherence to 
healthy behaviors reduced GrimAge2AA by β = -5.55 years, PhenoAgeAA by β = -2.64 
years, and DunedinPoAm by β = -0.06 SD, with smoking cessation demonstrating the 
strongest GrimAge2AA attenuation (10.17 years). Stratified analyses revealed 
pronounced benefits: cancer patients adhering to healthy diets (β = -0.04 SD, P 
for interaction = 0.01) and hypertensive individuals reducing smoking (β = -0.05 
SD, P for interaction = 0.04) showed significant EAA mitigation. The sensitivity 
analysis is consistent with the original results. Mediation analyses indicated 
GrimAge2AA accounted for 63.58% of lifestyle-survival associations, DunedinPoAm 
(44.63%) and PhenoAgeAA (28.45%).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that comprehensive adherence to healthy 
lifestyle behaviors is associated with reduced epigenetic aging, supporting 
their potential utility as targets for mortality risk mitigation. And emphasize 
the utility of epigenetic clocks in precision gerontology.

Cancer drug resistance is multifactorial, driven by heritable (epi)genetic 
changes but also by phenotypic plasticity. In this study, we dissected the 
drivers of resistance by perturbing organoids derived from patients with 
colorectal cancer longitudinally with drugs in sequence. Combined longitudinal 
lineage tracking, single-cell multiomics analysis, evolutionary modeling, and 
machine learning revealed that different targeted drugs select for distinct 
subclones, supporting rationally designed drug sequences. The cellular memory of 
drug resistance was encoded as a heritable epigenetic configuration from which 
multiple transcriptional programs could run, supporting a one-to-many 
(epi)genotype-to-phenotype map that explains how clonal expansions and 
plasticity manifest together. This epigenetic landscape may ensure 
drug-resistant subclones can exhibit distinct phenotypes in changing 
environments while still preserving the cellular memory encoding for their 
selective advantage. Chemotherapy resistance was instead entirely driven by 
transient phenotypic plasticity rather than stable clonal selection. Inducing 
further chromosomal instability before drug application changed clonal evolution 
but not convergent transcriptional programs. Collectively, these data show how 
genetic and epigenetic alterations are selected to engender a ""permissive 
epigenome"" that enables phenotypic plasticity.
SIGNIFICANCE: Drug resistance is driven by genetic-epigenetic memory that 
enables cancer cells to adopt multiple phenotypic states depending on 
environmental conditions, supporting integration of evolutionary principles into 
biomarker discovery and personalized treatment strategies. This article is part 
of a special series: Driving Cancer Discoveries with Computational Research, 
Data Science, and Machine Learning/AI.

Cervical cancer (CC) remains a significant public health issue in low- and 
middle-income countries (LMICs), especially in Western sub-Saharan Africa and 
Nigeria. While global CC incidence and mortality have declined, these regions 
continue to face high rates due to inadequate screening and the high prevalence 
of HIV, which increases CC risk by promoting persistent HPV infections. This 
study aimed to identify DNA methylation (DNAm) biomarkers for cervical 
intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and CC in HIV-positive Nigerian women and to 
assess their potential for clinical risk prediction. From 2018 to 2020, 538 
participants were recruited from Nigerian tertiary hospitals. Cervical tissue 
samples were analyzed for DNAm using the Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip 
array, and HPV genotyping was conducted via next-generation sequencing. An 
epigenome-wide association study revealed 24 significant DNAm biomarkers 
associated with CIN and CC. These biomarkers showed hypermethylation in tumor 
suppressor genes (e.g., PRMD8), hypomethylation in oncogenes (e.g., MIR520H), 
and aberrant methylation in genes related to HIV/HPV infection and oncogenesis 
(e.g., GNB5, LMO4, FOXK2, NMT1). A machine learning-based DNAm classifier 
achieved 92.9% sensitivity and 88.6% specificity in predicting CC risk, with 
higher risk observed in adjacent normal cervical samples from CIN/CC patients 
and HIV/HPV co-infected women. DNAm biomarkers offer a promising approach to 
enhancing CC screening and early detection, particularly for HIV-positive women 
in LMICs. The DNAm-based model developed in this study shows potential for more 
accurate CC risk stratification, highlighting the need for further optimization, 
validation, and implementation in low-resource settings.

BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)-induced chronic atrophic gastritis 
(CAG) is a significant health concern. The role of microsomal triglyceride 
transfer protein (MTTP) in CAG progression has not been explored, presenting a 
critical knowledge gap in understanding H. pylori-induced CAG pathogenesis.
METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats and gastric epithelial cell line were infected with 
H. pylori to build CAG model. The mRNA and protein levels of DNA 
methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), MTTP, and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) were 
measured by quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) and western blotting, 
respectively. Moreover, the localization of DNMT1 and MTTP was detected via 
immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, the pathological changes of gastric tissue 
were analyzed by HE staining.
RESULTS: The MTTP expression was downregulated in CAG. Moreover, overexpression 
of MTTP in gastric epithelial cells could suppress the inflammatory response 
induced by H. pylori infection and ferroptosis by upregulating GPX4 expression. 
In addition, DNMT1 expression was upregulated in CAG and was negatively 
correlated with MTTP expression. Furthermore, DNMT1 could target MTTP promoter 
to activate methylation and downregulate MTTP expression.
CONCLUSION: DNMT1 downregulated the MTTP expression through methylation, and 
thus mediate inflammasome-ferroptosis processes via GPX4 in the H. 
pylori-induced CAG.

Plain Language Summary: Chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG) is a condition where 
the stomach lining becomes thinner and more damaged over time. It is often 
caused by infection with common stomach bacteria called Helicobacter pylori (H. 
pylori). CAG increases the risk of developing stomach cancer, so understanding 
how it develops is important for finding better treatments.In this study, we 
looked at a protein called MTTP, which usually helps with fat transport in 
cells. We found that MTTP levels are much lower in the stomachs of people and 
animals with CAG. When we increased MTTP levels in stomach cells in the lab, the 
cells were less damaged by H. pylori. This means MTTP may help protect stomach 
cells.We also discovered that another protein, DNMT1, plays a role in reducing 
MTTP levels. DNMT1 can “turn off” genes using a process called DNA methylation. 
When DNMT1 levels were high, MTTP levels went down. But when we blocked DNMT1 in 
animals, MTTP levels stayed higher and stomach damage was reduced.These findings 
suggest that boosting MTTP or blocking DNMT1 might be a new way to help prevent 
or treat stomach problems caused by H. pylori.

The focus of aging research has shifted from increasing lifespan to enhancing 
healthspan to reduce the time spent living with disability. Despite significant 
efforts to develop biomarkers of aging, few studies have focused on biomarkers 
of healthspan. We developed a proteomics-based signature of healthspan 
[healthspan proteomic score (HPS)] using proteomic data from the Olink Explore 
3072 assay in the UK Biobank Pharma Proteomics Project (53,018 individuals and 
2,920 proteins). A lower HPS was associated with higher mortality risk and 
several age-related conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 
diabetes, heart failure, cancer, myocardial infarction, dementia, and stroke. 
HPS showed superior predictive accuracy for these outcomes compared to other 
biological age measures. Proteins associated with HPS were enriched in hallmark 
pathways such as immune response, inflammation, cellular signaling, and 
metabolic regulation. The external validity was evaluated using the Essential 
Hypertension Epigenetics study with proteomic data also from the Olink Explore 
3072 and complementary epigenetic data, making it a valuable tool for assessing 
healthspan and as a potential surrogate marker to complement existing proteomic 
and epigenetic biological age measures in geroscience-guided studies.

BACKGROUND: The detection of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) after curative-intent 
therapy, referred to as molecular/minimal residual disease (MRD), is prognostic 
of disease recurrence in early-stage breast cancer (EBC). Tumor-agnostic 
approaches that rely on mutation-based assessment in fixed panels of common 
cancer driver genes have shown limited utility for detecting MRD in EBC. 
Methylation-based MRD (mMRD) may overcome the limitations of genomic-based MRD 
(gMRD), though limited clinical validation is available.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: To investigate this, we analyzed 290 longitudinally 
banked plasma samples from 95 participants diagnosed with early-stage estrogen 
receptor (ER)-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative 
(ER-positive) and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) undergoing neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy using a high-sensitivity genomic and epigenomic-based, 
tumor-agnostic ctDNA platform.
RESULTS: The baseline (pre-chemotherapy) ctDNA detection (mMRD) rate was 72.5% 
(66/91) across all participants (ER-positive: 33/48, 69%; TNBC: 33/43, 77%). 
Baseline ctDNA detection (mMRD) was associated with a higher risk of recurrence 
[hazard ratio (HR) 9.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3-70.3, P = 0.03]. 
Detection of ctDNA (mMRD) in the post-operative and follow-up periods were 
prognostic of worse event-free survival (EFS) (HR 17.0, 95% CI 6.0-48.0, P < 
0.0001) with 62.5% sensitivity and 100% specificity for recurrence (positive 
predictive value 100%). The median lead time from mMRD detection to clinical 
recurrence was 152 days (range 15-748 days). gMRD, derived from plasma-only 
panel-based next-generation sequencing, was evaluated in all matched time 
points; the prognostic value was limited by clonal hematopoiesis of 
indeterminate potential, including pathogenic mutations in common cancer driver 
genes. Despite refinements in gMRD analysis, it remained inferior to mMRD. A 
combination of mMRD and gMRD did not outperform mMRD alone.
CONCLUSION: These results support further development of tumor-agnostic mMRD 
assays for the detection of ctDNA and assessment of these assays to develop 
clinical utility in this setting.

BACKGROUND: During perioperative care for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
patients, clinical outcomes vary significantly. There is a critical need for 
more dependable biomarkers to identify high-risk individuals in the 
perioperative phase. This is essential for enhancing postoperative interventions 
and positively influencing clinical results.
METHOD: We collected a tissue DNA methylation cohort of 73 stage I-III 
surgically treated patients as the discovery set for model development. The 
model was established using recurrence-free survival (RFS) as the primary 
endpoint. Subsequently, its prognostic value was validated in an independent 
cohort of 30 stage I-III surgical patients, and further confirmed across 
different patient subgroups.
RESULTS: We developed an Early to Mid-term NSCLC Recurrence LASSO score (EMRL) 
predictive model based on five differentially methylated regions (DMRs). The 
EMRL model was significantly associated with RFS in stage I-III surgically 
treated patients (RFS: log-rank P = 0.00032) and was confirmed as an independent 
prognostic factor in multivariate Cox regression analysis (HR = 0.35, 95% 
confidence interval 0.20-0.61, P < 0.001). Notably, EMRL not only identified 
high-risk patients within the same TNM stage but also demonstrated strong 
predictive performance in patient subgroups harboring EGFR-TKI-sensitive 
mutations and those with positive PD-L1 expression.
CONCLUSION: In this study, we developed a postoperative recurrence prediction 
model based on preoperative tissue methylation characteristics to identify 
individuals in I-III stage NSCLC patients following surgical resection who may 
have a higher risk of recurrence. This offers opportunities for early 
personalized treatment and follow-up strategy.

Colon cancer is a prevalent malignancy influenced by genetics and environmental 
factors. Diets rich in charred and fried red meats, thus high in heterocyclic 
aromatic amines [e.g., 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP)], 
are associated with increased colon cancer risk. Conversely, the consumption of 
fruits and vegetables offers protective effects, potentially modulating multiple 
carcinogenesis-related pathways. Here, we investigated the metabolomic response 
to apiaceous and cruciferous vegetable consumption in relation to concomitant 
PhIP consumption. In a randomized crossover design, 25 participants underwent 
four phases with four different test meals at the end of each phase. Test meals 
were well-done hamburger (Control), Control plus cruciferous vegetables (Cru), 
Control plus apiaceous vegetables (Api), and Control plus combined vegetable 
types (Cru + Api). Urine samples were subjected to metabolomics analysis using 
UPLC-MS/MS system. A total of 660 metabolites were identified. The Cru and Api 
meals showed distinct metabolite profiles, and the Cru + Api meal induced 133 
metabolite changes compared to Control. Meals with cruciferous vegetables 
enriched S-methylcysteine, S-methylcysteine sulfoxide, N-acetylproline, 
sulforaphane-related compounds, and xenobiotic and amino acid metabolites the 
most. The Api meal was not as effective in altering xenobiotic metabolites. Api 
primarily elevated mannitol/sorbitol. To a lesser extent, both 
vegetable-supplemented meals induced changes in nucleotide-derived metabolites 
suggesting potential epigenetic modifications. The findings reinforce the 
influence of these vegetables on xenobiotic metabolism pathways, highlight 
potential epigenetic mechanisms and potential biomarkers of food intake, and 
provide further elucidation of their possible roles in colon cancer prevention.

BACKGROUND: Recent studies have demonstrated that patients with stage IB-IIIA 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring EGFR mutations (EGFRm) can 
significantly benefit from adjuvant therapy with EGFR-TKIs. Nevertheless, there 
remains controversial in clinical practice about the use of EGFR-TKI adjuvant 
therapy for patients with stage IB EGFRm NSCLC.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted at the Second Xiangya 
Hospital of Central South University. From January 2011 to December 2020, 
completely resected stage IA-IB NSCLC (8th TNM staging) patients with sensitive 
EGFR mutation were included. FFPE tumor and lymph node specimens were collected 
and subjected to the 8-gene methylation panel using modified MOB-qMSP approach. 
We employed stepwise regression to select variables and logistic regression to 
establish the predictive model. Cross-validation and decision curve analysis 
were performed.
RESULTS: A total of 242 patients with IA2-IB EGFRm NSCLC were included in the 
study. Among these patients, 86 constituted the recurrence (Rec) group, while 
156 formed the non-recurrence (Non-Rec) group. Through stepwise logistic 
regression, seven crucial feature variables were identified, including five-gene 
methylation variables (CDO1, TAC1, p16, CDH13, and APC) and two clinical 
variables (tumor invasion and differentiation). The ROC analysis revealed an AUC 
of 0.873 for the model with these seven variables. Internal cross-validation 
demonstrated a model accuracy exceeding 77%. The nomogram and decision curve 
analysis underscored the clinical utility of the model. We calculated the total 
score for each patient based on the nomogram and divided the patients into 
high-risk and low-risk groups. The cumulative risk curves for both groups 
evidenced that the recurrence risk in the high-risk group was significantly 
higher than in the low-risk group. We further divided the dataset into two 
cohorts-stage IA2-IA3 patients and stage IB patients. The model maintained a 
high AUC value (0.879) in stage IA2-A3 patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that the methylation of five genes-CDO1, 
TAC1, p16, CDH13, and APC-in N2 lymph nodes represents a strong biomarker panel 
for predicting recurrence in stage IB EGFRm NSCLC after curative resection. This 
approach also shows exceptional predictive accuracy for postoperative recurrence 
in stage IA2-IA3 EGFRm NSCLC.

Lineage plasticity is recognized as a critical determinant of lethality and 
resistance to AR pathway inhibitors in prostate cancer. Lineage plasticity is a 
continuum, ranging from AR activity-low tumors, AR-null tumors that do not 
express a neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) program (i.e., double-negative 
prostate cancer [DNPC]), and AR-null NEPC tumors. Factors upregulated early in 
lineage plasticity are not well-characterized. The clarification of such factors 
is essential to identify tumors undergoing lineage plasticity or at risk of this 
occurring. Our integrative analysis of metastatic prostate cancer patient 
tumors, patient-derived xenografts, and cell models determined that PROX1 is 
upregulated early in the lineage plasticity continuum and progressively 
increases as tumors lose AR activity. We determined DNA methylation is a key 
regulator of PROX1 expression. PROX1 suppression in DNPC and NEPC reduces cell 
survival and impacts apoptosis and differentiation, demonstrating PROX1's 
functional importance. PROX1 is not directly targetable with standard drug 
development approaches. However, affinity immunopurification demonstrated 
histone deacetylases (HDACs) are among the top PROX1-interacting proteins; HDAC 
inhibition depletes PROX1 and recapitulates PROX1 suppression in DNPC and NEPC. 
Altogether, our results suggest PROX1 promotes the emergence of lineage 
plasticity, and HDAC inhibition is a promising approach to treat tumors across 
the lineage plasticity continuum.

Cervical cancer is one of the most common cancers in women. Despite progress in 
prevention and success in early detection through cytologic screening and human 
papillomavirus (HPV) detection, there remains a challenge in triaging women 
appropriately to colposcopy and biopsy. We sought to validate the CervicalMethDx 
test, a precision DNA methylation classifier for cervical cancer detection, as a 
reflex test in women with HPV-positive samples. A blinded retrospective study 
was performed on well-characterized samples in PreservCyt media from a large 
referral clinical laboratory in the United States. DNA methylation was assessed 
in three gene promoters (ZNF516, FKBP6, and INTS1) and a control gene (β-actin) 
by quantitative real-time methylation-specific PCR (qMSP) analysis, using 
machine learning algorithms. We compared DNA methylation levels in HPV-positive 
patients presenting with lesions in the Pap test and cervical intraepithelial 
neoplasia grade 2 (CIN2) or CIN3 histologic diagnosis with DNA methylation 
levels in HPV-positive patients with lesions in the Pap test but no 
intraepithelial lesion or malignancy. The CervicalMethDx test correctly 
classified 95% of the CIN2 samples (n = 210), with 91% sensitivity, 100% 
specificity, and an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.96, and 94% of CIN3 
samples (n = 141), with 90% sensitivity, 100% specificity, and an AUC of 0.96. 
Moreover, the CervicalMethDx test correctly classified 94% of combined CIN2/CIN3 
samples (n = 351), with 93% sensitivity, 97% specificity, and an AUC of 0.96. 
CervicalMethDx demonstrated strong discriminatory power for identifying 
CIN2/CIN3 risk and may complement current triage strategies for colposcopy 
referral. Prospective, population-based studies, including those in low-resource 
settings, are needed for further evaluation.
PREVENTION RELEVANCE: The CervicalMethDx test integrates DNA methylation 
analysis and machine learning to improve early detection of high-grade cervical 
lesions (high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions), offering a noninvasive, 
cost-effective screening tool. Enhanced risk stratification and overtreatment 
reduction expand equitable access to precision prevention programs. Further 
validation will clarify CervicalMethDx's alignment with global cervical cancer 
prevention strategies.

BACKGROUND: Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) represent a crucial component 
of tumor stroma and play critical roles in cancer progression. However, the role 
of CAFs derived exosomes in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) environment is 
unexplored. PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) serve as epigenetic effectors in 
cancer progression and constitute significant compositions of exosomes. Here, we 
explored the functional mechanism of exosomal piRNAs in OSCC development.
METHODS: We screened exosomal piRNAs derived from CAFs and normal fibroblasts 
(NFs) and assess their effect on tumor proliferation and metastasis. A nude 
mouse model was established to assess the impact of exosomal piR-35462 on tumor 
progression.
RESULTS: CAFs-derived exosomes showed an enhanced piR-35462 expression and 
promoted OSCC cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Additionally, elevated 
piR-35462 expression in OSCC tissues correlates with poor prognosis. 
Mechanistically, CAFs-derived exosomal piR-35462 increased the expression of fat 
mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) in OSCC cells. By inhibiting 
N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA methylation, the overexpression of FTO further 
enhances the stability and expression levels of Twist1 mRNA, thereby 
contributing to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and tumor progression. 
In vivo xenograft tumor model also confirmed the same results.
CONCLUSION: The achieved outcomes elucidate that CAFs can deliver piR-35462 
containing exosomes to OSCC cells and promote OSCC progression via FTO/Twist 
mediated EMT pathways, and could represent a promising therapeutic target for 
OSCC.

BACKGROUND: Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) exhibits significant heterogeneity in 
clinical outcomes, yet current prognostic stratification systems based on 
genetic alterations alone cannot fully capture this complexity. This study aimed 
to develop an integrated epigenetic-based classification system and evaluate its 
prognostic value.
METHODS: We performed multi-omics analysis on five independent cohorts totaling 
1,103 AML patients. The Cancer Genome Atlas-Acute Myeloid Leukemia (TCGA-LAML) 
cohort (n = 83) provided comprehensive multi-omics data including DNA 
methylation profiles (Illumina 450K platform), RNA sequencing (mRNA, lncRNA, and 
miRNA), and somatic mutation profiles. The BEAT (n = 649), TARGET (n = 156), 
GSE12417 (n = 79), and GSE37642 (n = 136) cohorts contributed transcriptome 
data. Molecular subtypes were identified using empirical Bayes-based clustering 
on the TCGA cohort. LSC17 scores were calculated using a validated 17-gene 
expression signature. A random survival forest model was developed integrating 
molecular features with LSC17 scores, validated across all cohorts. Immune 
microenvironment analysis employed multiple deconvolution methods (ESTIMATE, 
CIBERSORT, xCell) and pathway analysis (GSVA, GSEA). Drug sensitivity was 
predicted using the pRRophetic algorithm with GDSC database reference.
RESULTS: Multi-omics integration revealed two molecularly distinct AML subtypes 
with significant survival differences (CS2 vs CS1, P < 0.001). The random 
survival forest model, incorporating 20 key epigenetic features (including 
CPNE8, CD109, and CHRDL1) and LSC17 scores, achieved superior prognostic 
accuracy (C-index: 0.72-0.78) across validation cohorts. Both epigenetic risk 
score (HR = 2.45, 95%CI: 1.86-3.24) and LSC17 score (HR = 1.89, 95%CI: 
1.42-2.51) maintained independent prognostic value in multivariate analysis. 
Integration of both scores in a nomogram improved 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival 
predictions (C-index: 0.81). High-risk patients exhibited distinct immune 
profiles with elevated M2 macrophages (1.8-fold) and Tregs (2.3-fold), while 
low-risk patients showed enhanced NK cell activity (2.1-fold). Drug sensitivity 
analysis identified differential responses to epigenetic regulators (LAQ824, 
P = 0.000139; MS-275, P = 0.00104) and proteasome inhibitors (Bortezomib, 
P = 0.00747; MG-132, P = 0.0106) between risk groups.
CONCLUSIONS: This integrated classification system combining epigenetic features 
and stem cell signatures provides new insights into AML heterogeneity and 
therapeutic targeting. The complementary nature of epigenetic and stem 
cell-related prognostic factors suggests potential for improved risk 
stratification in clinical practice. Future prospective validation studies are 
warranted to confirm these findings.

Lung cancers develop from lung epithelial cells after a series of genetic and 
epigenetic changes, and these cells are major sites of influenza virus 
infection. Thus, we explored how changes found in patient-derived lung cancer 
cell lines impacted influenza virus replication and identified two lines with 
opposite responses to influenza A viral infection. We show that the NCI-H820 
lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is resistant to influenza A virus and VSV infection, 
while LUAD line NCI-H322 is highly susceptible to infection by both viruses. 
H322 cells have a homozygous deletion in a region of chromosome 9 encoding 
IFNαgenes, IFNβ1, IFNω1, and IFNε genes, leading to downregulation of immune 
response and high infection rates. In contrast, the resistant H820 cell line has 
three copies of these same interferon genes and shows increased expression of 
interferon-regulated genes. We found that the resistance of H820 cells to 
influenza infection is likely linked to impaired viral entry-due to high basal 
levels of interferon-induced proteins known to inhibit endocytosis (IFITM1/2/3, 
NCOA7, and CH25H)-and to increased expression of mRNAs that encode other 
antiviral factors. In contrast, H322 cells show the absence or low levels of 
interferon-regulated genes involved in the inhibition of viral entry. These 
results suggest that the opposite phenotypes on viral entry of H322 and H820 
cells may be at least in part associated with impaired or enhanced interferon 
response, respectively. Since most lung cancer patients have genomic 
characterization of their tumors, individualized differences in interferon 
responses may have therapeutic and patient management implications.
IMPORTANCE: Lung cancers develop from genetic and epigenetic changes that can 
dramatically influence patients' susceptibility to viral infection and 
replication. This study evaluates the responses to influenza virus infection of 
two patient-derived lung cancer cell lines. Interestingly, the cell lines 
investigated are of the same cancer type, lung adenocarcinomas, yet one cell 
line is highly susceptible, while the other cell line is highly resistant to 
viral infection. This is in part due to contrasting genetic alterations that 
lead to changes in the interferon response pathways, which differentially impact 
viral entry. Thus, identifying these risk factors can inform the prognosis of 
patients infected with influenza virus and guide their personalized treatment 
plans.

Gut microbes play an immense role in digesting ingested food, providing 
nutrients to the host, and producing several bioactive metabolites that not only 
help maintain health but can also elicit disease during dysbiotic conditions. 
The bioactive compounds derived from gut microbiota metabolites include 
trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), uremic toxins, short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), 
phytoestrogens, anthocyanins, bile acids, lipopolysaccharide - to name a few. 
Once these compounds enter the host cells, tissues, and organs they can cause 
diseases such as epigenetic, metabolic, neurodegenerative, psychiatric, 
cardiovascular, hypertension, respiratory, gastrointestinal, kidney, bone, 
cancer, and others. Regulating healthy gut microbiota thus provides a potential 
option for the prevention, reversal, or even treatment of these diseases. 
Towards this end, various interventional strategies are postulated in this field 
of emerged and rapidly expanding health research arena that includes fecal 
microbiota transplantation, prebiotics, and probiotics, and to introduce the 
concept that correcting gut dysbiosis can ameliorate disease symptoms, thus 
offering a new approach towards dysbiosis-related disease mitigation and 
treatment. In the special issue of Pharmacological Research titled ""Gut 
Microbiota and Well-Being,"" several outstanding research findings and review 
articles are published, covering a broad spectrum of topics related to the 
influence of gut microbiota on health and disease. This editorial summarizes 
each of these contributions, prioritizing research findings before discussing 
the review articles. The summaries are restructured abstracts of relevant 
articles focusing on major findings or thematic topics.

Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of melanoma risk have identified 68 
independent signals at 54 loci. For most loci, specific functional variants and 
their respective target genes remain to be established. Capture-HiC is an assay 
that links fine-mapped risk variants to candidate target genes by 
comprehensively mapping chromatin interactions. We performed a melanoma GWAS 
region-focused capture-HiC assay in human primary melanocytes to identify 
physical interactions between fine-mapped risk variants and potential causal 
melanoma-susceptibility genes. Overall, chromatin-interaction data alone 
nominated potential causal genes for 61 of the 68 melanoma risk signals, 
identifying many candidates beyond those reported by previous studies. We 
further integrated these data with epigenomic (chromatin state, accessibility), 
gene expression (expression quantitative trait locus [eQTL]/transcriptome-wide 
association study [TWAS]), DNA methylation (methylation QTL 
[meQTL]/methylome-wide association study [MWAS]), and massively parallel 
reporter assay (MPRA) data generated from melanoma-relevant cell types to 
prioritize potentially cis-regulatory variants and their respective candidate 
gene targets. From the set of fine-mapped variants across these loci, we 
identified 140 prioritized credible causal variants linked to 195 candidate 
genes at 42 risk signals. In addition, we developed an integrative scoring 
system to facilitate candidate gene prioritization, integrating melanocyte and 
melanoma datasets. Notably, at several GWAS risk signals, we observed long-range 
chromatin connections (500 kb to >1 Mb) with distant candidate target genes. We 
validated several such cis-regulatory interactions using CRISPR inhibition, 
providing evidence for known cancer driver genes MDM4 and CBL, as well as the 
SRY-box transcription factor SOX4, as likely melanoma risk genes.

DNA methylation at cg05575921, an established biomarker for smoking predicts 
risk for lung cancer (LC). Although heavy alcohol consumption (HAC) frequently 
accompanies smoking, the relationship of HAC to overall mortality in those at 
risk for LC is not well known. Determining the contribution of HAC to mortality 
in those who smoke is important because HAC is also a major driver of mortality 
and is potentially treatable. To help answer this question, we examined the 
relationship of epigenetic biomarkers of smoking (cg05575921) and chronic heavy 
alcohol consumption (Alcohol T Score, ATS) in a cohort of 92 LC cases and 402 
age, sex, ethnicity and smoking history matched controls from the Prostate, 
Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Screening Trial to all-cause mortality using 
proportional hazards survival analysis. We found that ATS values significantly 
predicted risk for all-cause mortality in those smokers who developed (p < 0.03) 
and did not develop lung cancer (p < 0.0001). When mortality data were analyzed 
using median splits, those who did and did not incur lung cancer with ATS values 
<3.6 lived 5.6 years and 3.2 years more, respectfully, than those with ATS 
values >3.6. Interestingly, in this group of 494 smokers or former smokers, 
after adjusting for the occurrence of lung cancer, cg05575921 methylation did 
not predict mortality. In summary, we found that excessive alcohol consumption 
is a significant risk factor for all-cause mortality in those at risk for LC and 
suggest that lung cancer screening efforts to address problem drinking could 
increase survival.

To evaluate the immediate risk of (pre)cancer for cytology low-grade squamous 
intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) women infected with or without specific HPV 
genotype and develop a risk-based management strategy. A total of 4567 LSIL 
women with extended HPV genotyping and colposcopy results were enrolled 
according to the inclusive and exclusive criteria. The distribution and 
immediate cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse and 3+ or worse 
(CIN2+/3+) risks of specific HPV genotypes were assessed using Minimum Estimate, 
Any Type Estimate, and Hierarchical Attribution Estimate. A risk-based strategy 
was further established and evaluated. CIN2+/3+ were 729/328 cases, including 
691/317 in 3398 HPV-positive and 38/11 in 1169 HPV-negative women. HPV16, 52, 
58, and 18 were the most prevalent genotypes in both HPV-positive and CIN2+/3+ 
cases. HPV16, 73, and 33 carried the highest immediate CIN2+/3+ risk. A 
risk-based strategy was established, which suggested Group A (HPV 16, 33, 45, 
31, 18, 58, 52, 35, 73, 82; with immediate CIN3+ risk of 4.08%-22.12%) for 
immediate colposcopy, Group B (HPV 59, 66, 56, 53) for 6-month follow-up or 
p16/Ki-67 dual stain or DNA methylation triage, while Group C (HPV 51, 68, 39, 
26) for 1-year HPV repeat testing. Compared with conventional strategy, this new 
strategy showed significantly higher specificity (CIN2+: 52.16% vs. 29.47%, 
χ2 = 409.136, p < 0.001; CIN3+: 48.45% vs. 27.32%, χ2 = 402.395, p < 0.001) but 
similar sensitivity, which could reduce immediate colposcopy referrals by 
19.82%. A risk-based triage strategy for LSIL women with extended HPV genotyping 
could effectively reduce unnecessary colposcopies and maintain high efficacy for 
CIN2+/3+ detection.

BACKGROUND: Maternal obesity is a health concern that may predispose newborns to 
a high risk of medical problems later in life. To understand the 
intergenerational effect of maternal obesity, we hypothesized that the maternal 
obesity effect is mediated by epigenetic changes in the CD34+/CD38-/Lin- 
hematopoietic stem cells (uHSCs) in the offspring. To investigate this, we 
conducted a DNA methylation centric multiomics study. We measured DNA 
methylation and gene expression of the CD34+/CD38-/Lin- uHSCs and metabolomics 
of the cord blood, all from a multiethnic cohort from Kapiolani Medical Center 
for Women and Children in Honolulu, Hawaii (n=72, collected between 2016 and 
2018).
RESULTS: Differential methylation analysis unveiled a global hypermethylation 
pattern in the maternal prepregnancy obese group (BH adjusted P < 0.05), after 
adjusting for major clinical confounders. KEGG pathway enrichment, WGCNA, and 
PPI analyses revealed that hypermethylated CpG sites were involved in critical 
biological processes, including cell cycle, protein synthesis, immune signaling, 
and lipid metabolism. Utilizing Shannon entropy on uHSCs methylation, we 
discerned notably higher quiescence of uHSCs impacted by maternal obesity. 
Additionally, the integration of multiomics data-including methylation, gene 
expression, and metabolomics-provided further evidence of dysfunctions in 
adipogenesis, erythropoietin production, cell differentiation, and DNA repair, 
aligning with the findings at the epigenetic level. Furthermore, we trained a 
random forest classifier using the CpG sites in the genes of the top pathways 
associated with maternal obesity, and applied it to predict cancer versus 
adjacent normal sample labels in 14 Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cancer types. 
Five of 14 cancers showed balanced accuracy of 0.6 or higher: LUSC (0.87), PAAD 
(0.83), KIRC (0.71), KIRP (0.63) and BRCA (0.60).
CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed the significant correlation between 
prepregnancy maternal obesity and multiomics-level molecular changes in the 
uHSCs of offspring, particularly at the DNA methylation level. These 
maternal-obesity-associated epigenetic markers in uHSCs may contribute to 
increased risks in certain cancers of the offspring. Larger and multicenter 
cohort validation studies are warranted to follow up the current single-site 
study.

BACKGROUND: Human Endogenous RetroVirus (HERV) expression in tumours reflects 
epigenetic dysregulation of cancer and an oncogenic factor through 
promoter/enhancer action on genes. While more than 50% of colorectal cancers 
develop liver metastases, HERV has not been studied in this context.
METHODS: We collected 400 RNA-seq samples from over 200 patients with primary 
and liver metastases, including public data and a novel set of 200 samples.
FINDINGS: We observed global stability of HERV expression between liver 
metastases and primary colorectal cancers, suggesting an early oncogenic 
footprint. We identified a list of 17 HERV loci for liver metastatic colorectal 
cancer (lmCRC) characterization; with tumour-specificity validated in 
single-cell metastatic colorectal cancer data and normal tissue bulk RNA-seq. 
Eleven loci produced HERV-derived peptides as per tandem mass spectrometry from 
primary colorectal cancer. Six loci were associated with the risk of relapse 
after lmCRC surgery. Four, HERVH_Xp22.32a, HERVH_20p11.23b, HERVH_13q33.3, 
HERVH_13q31.3, had adverse prognostic value (log-rank p-value 0.028, 0.0083, 
9e-4, 0.05, respectively) while two, HERVH_Xp22.2c (log-rank p-value 0.032) and 
HERVH_8q21.3b (in multivariable models) were associated with better prognosis. 
Moreover, the markers showed a cumulative effect on survival when expressed. 
Some were associated with decreased cytotoxic immune cells and most of them 
correlated with cell cycle pathways.
INTERPRETATION: These findings provide insights into the lmCRC transcriptome 
landscape by suggesting prognostic markers and potential therapeutic targets.

IntroductionNon-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which accounts for >85% of all 
lung cancers, is the most common solid malignant tumor, with high morbidity and 
mortality worldwide. Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor 
(EGFR-TKI) treatment is widely used clinically because the epidermal growth 
factor receptor (EGFR) is the main driver gene of lung cancer; however, the 
development of drug resistance is inevitable. Epigenetic abnormalities can also 
lead to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) resistance. However, the relationship 
between N6-methyladenosine (m6A)-related proteins and EGFR mutations in NSCLC 
and their clinical significance remain unclear. In this retrospective study, the 
expression of m6A-related regulatory factors in patients with EGFR mutations 
were analyzed to investigate their relationship with clinicopathological 
features and prognoses.MethodsThe association between m6A-related regulatory 
factors and NSCLC was analyzed using data derived from The Cancer Genome Atlas, 
case collection, follow-up, immunohistochemistry, and scoring.ResultsA total of 
246 NSCLC specimens were examined in this study. Among these, 143 EGFR-mutant 
cases exhibited significantly higher expression of METTL3 and ALKBH5 compared to 
EGFR-wildtype specimens. The median progression-free survival time of patients 
with high METTL3 expression (SI >6) was 25.0 months, and that of patients with 
high ALKBH5 expression (SI >6) was 24.1 months in EGFR-mutant cases. High METTL3 
and ALKBH5 expression levels are independent risk factors for progression-free 
survival in patients with EGFR mutations. The median progression-free survival 
time of patients with EGFR mutations was 45.7 months in those with high 
expression of METTL3 or ALKBH5 alone, whereas it decreased to 20.1 months in 
those with high simultaneous expression of METTL3 and ALKBH5.ConclusionsMETTL3 
and ALKBH5 were upregulated in NSCLC tissues with EGFR mutations and 
significantly correlated with poor prognoses. Thus, METTL3 and ALKBH5 may serve 
as prognostic biomarkers in EGFR-mutant NSCLC.

Plain Language Summary: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which accounts for 
>85% of all lung cancers, is the most common solid malignant tumor with high 
morbidity and mortality worldwide. Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine 
kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) treatment is widely used clinically because the 
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is the main driver gene of lung cancer; 
however, drug resistance is inevitable. Epigenetic abnormalities can also lead 
to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) resistance. However, the relationship between 
N6-methyladenosine (m6A)-related proteins and EGFR mutations in NSCLC and their 
clinical significance remain unclear. In this retrospective study, the 
expression of m6A-related regulatory factors in patients with EGFR mutations 
were analyzed to explain their relationship with clinicopathological features 
and prognoses. A total of 246 NSCLC specimens were examined in this study. Among 
these, 143 EGFR-mutant cases exhibited significantly higher expression of METTL3 
and ALKBH5 compared to EGFR-wildtype specimens. The median progression-free 
survival time of patients with high METTL3 expression (SI >6) was 25.0 months, 
and that of patients with high ALKBH5 expression (SI >6) was 24.1 months in 
EGFR-mutant cases. High METTL3 and ALKBH5 expression levels are independent risk 
factors for progression-free survival in patients with EGFR mutations. The 
median progression-free survival time of patients with EGFR mutations was 
45.7 months in those with high expression of METTL3 or ALKBH5 alone, whereas it 
decreased to 20.1 months in those with high simultaneous expression of METTL3 
and ALKBH5. METTL3 and ALKBH5 were upregulated in NSCLC tissues with EGFR 
mutations and significantly correlated with poor prognoses. Thus, METTL3 and 
ALKBH5 may serve as prognostic biomarkers in EGFR-mutant NSCLC.

PURPOSE: The newly discovered histone methyltransferase KMT9 serves as an 
epigenetic regulator of carcinogenesis in various cancer entities. For the first 
time, we investigated the presence of KMT9α in cholangiocarcinoma, the 
association with histologic subtypes, and its impact on survival.
METHODS: A tissue microarray cohort of all CCA patients who underwent surgical 
resection with curative intent between 08/2005 and 12/2021 at the University 
Hospital Frankfurt was immunohistochemically analyzed with the KMT9α antibody. 
For overall survival, Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox-regression analyses were 
performed.
RESULTS: In total, 174 patients were suitable for IHC analysis. Of the patients, 
35.1% (n = 61) overexpressed KMT9α. Kaplan-Meier curves revealed a median OS of 
34.75 months (95% CI = 20.23-49.27 months) for all CCA patients positive for 
KMT9α in comparison to 54.21 months (95% CI = 41.78-66.63 months) for patients 
lacking KMT9α overexpression (p = 0.004). Subtype analysis revealed strong 
differences in KMT9α expression. Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified 
KMT9α as an independent risk factor for shorter OS in CCA.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that a marked subset of CCA patients exhibit 
overexpression of KMT9α. These findings underscore the prognostic significance 
of KMT9α and reinforce its potential as a therapeutic target, consistent with 
its role in other cancer types.

The occupation of firefighting is classified as a Group 1 carcinogen. Increased 
cancer risk among firefighters may be partly attributable to increased 
occupational exposure to a range of chemicals, including per- and 
polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Some PFAS are known and suspect human 
carcinogens. Investigating epigenetic response to these PFAS exposures in 
firefighters may help to identify biological pathways of specific cancers, and 
previously unidentified health outcomes that are associated with PFAS. We 
therefore investigated the associations of serum PFAS concentrations with miRNA 
expression in firefighters. Serum samples collected from 303 firefighters from 6 
sites across the USA were analyzed for 9 PFAS along with miRNA expression. 
Covariate-adjusted linear regression was used to estimate associations between 
log PFAS and miRNA expression, with false discovery rate (FDR) set to 0.05 for 
significance, and an exploratory cutoff of FDR q < 0.20. Gene set enrichment 
analysis (GSEA) was performed using miRTarBase's miRWalk pathways. Age, 
race-ethnicity, BMI, fire department, and sex were controlled for in all models. 
At FDR<0.05, the linear isomer of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) was 
inversely associated with miR-128-1-5p expression (Beta = -0.146, 95 % CI 
-0.216, -0.076). At a relaxed FDR of 0.20, we observed inverse associations for 
the sum of branched isomers of PFOS (Sm-PFOS) with 5 miRNAs (let-7d-5p, 
let-7a-5p, miR-423-5p, let-7b-5p, miR-629-5p). Several pathways were enriched 
for multiple PFAS, including those correlated with certain cancers, blood 
diseases, thyroid disorders, autoimmune disorders, and neurological outcomes. 
Some PFAS in firefighters were found to be associated with alteration of miRNA 
consistent with increased risk for a range of chronic diseases.

BACKGROUND: The incidence and mortality of endometrial cancer (EC) is on the 
rise. Eighty-five percent of ECs depend on estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) for 
proliferation, but little is known about its transcriptional regulation in these 
tumors.
RESULTS: We generate epigenomics, transcriptomics, and Hi-C datastreams in 
healthy and tumor endometrial tissues, identifying robust ERα reprogramming and 
profound alterations in 3D genome organization that lead to a gain of 
tumor-specific enhancer activity during EC development. Integration with 
endometrial cancer risk single-nucleotide polymorphisms and whole-genome 
sequencing data from primary tumors and metastatic samples reveals a striking 
enrichment of risk variants and non-coding somatic mutations at tumor-enriched 
ERα sites. Through machine learning-based predictions and interaction proteomics 
analyses, we identify an enhancer mutation which alters 3D genome conformation, 
impairing recruitment of the transcriptional repressor EHMT2/G9a/KMT1C, thereby 
alleviating transcriptional repression of ESR1 in EC.
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we identify a complex genomic-epigenomic interplay in 
EC development and progression, altering 3D genome organization to enhance 
expression of the critical driver ERα.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality 
worldwide, with metastasis being a major contributor to poor prognosis. 
MicroRNA-184 (miR-184) has been implicated in the progression of various 
cancers, but its role in CRC metastasis remains poorly defined. This study 
investigated the effects of miR-184 promoter demethylation on EPB41L5 expression 
and Notch signaling in CRC. SW620 human colon carcinoma cells were treated with 
the DNA methylation inhibitor 5-Aza for 96 h. Methylation status was assessed 
via bisulfite sequencing, and gene expression was evaluated using qRT-PCR and 
Western blotting. Functional assays were conducted to assess cell proliferation, 
apoptosis, migration, and invasion. 5-Aza treatment significantly decreased 
miR-184 promoter methylation, leading to increased miR-184 expression. This 
upregulation suppressed CRC cell migration and invasion, induced G2/M cell cycle 
arrest, and promoted apoptosis. Mechanistically, miR-184 inhibited EPB41L5 
expression, thereby downregulating the Notch signaling pathway and modulating 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers. High EPB41L5 expression in CRC 
tissues was associated with worse prognosis. These findings suggest that 
demethylated miR-184 inhibits CRC metastasis by targeting the EPB41L5/Notch 
signaling axis. This regulatory pathway may serve as a novel prognostic 
biomarker and therapeutic target, with potential clinical implications for the 
prevention and treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer.

BACKGROUND: Genetic predisposition is particularly common in children with the 
kidney cancer, Wilms tumor. In 10% of these children, this manifests as a family 
history of Wilms tumor or bilateral disease. The frequency and spectrum of 
underlying changes have not been systematically investigated.
METHODS: We analyzed 129 children with suspected Wilms tumor predisposition, 20 
familial cases, and 109 children with bilateral disease, enrolled over 30 years 
in the German SIOP93-01/GPOH and SIOP2001 studies. We used whole exome, whole 
genome, and targeted DNA sequencing, together with MLPA and targeted methylation 
assays on tumor, blood, and normal kidney to determine predisposing changes.
RESULTS: Predisposing variants were identified in 117/129 children, comprising 
DNA variants (57%) and epigenetic changes (34%). Most children had 
predisposition variants in genes previously implicated in Wilms tumor: most 
prominently WT1 (n = 35) and less frequently TRIM28, REST, DIS3L2, CTR9, DICER1, 
CDC73, and NONO. Nine children carried germline mutations in cancer 
predisposition genes not considered Wilms tumor predisposition genes, such as 
CHEK2, CDKN2A, BLM, BRCA2, STK11, and FMN2. Predisposition via epigenetic 
BWS-IC1 alterations occurred as early somatic events, reflected by partial 
(mosaic) loss of imprinting or loss of heterozygosity at the IGF2/H19 locus in 
normal kidney or blood. These patients rarely had a clinical diagnosis of 
Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS). Especially WT1-driven tumors follow a 
stereotypical pathway of germline WT1 mutations becoming homozygous in renal 
precursor lesions through 11p LOH, which concomitantly activates imprinted IGF2 
expression, with subsequent WNT pathway activation leading to tumor growth. 
There is a high rate of multicentric tumors, which may have previously been 
missed in unilateral tumors. While Wilms tumor predisposition genes relied on 
somatic inactivation of the second allele, this was different for general cancer 
predisposition genes. The latter cases were often associated with additional 
oncogenic alterations, similar to tumors with epigenetic predisposition.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified two main mechanisms of Wilms tumor predisposition: 
either germline genetic alterations of Wilms tumor and, less frequently, general 
cancer genes; or postzygotic mosaic imprinting defects activating IGF2. These 
findings inform future genetic screening and risk assessment of affected 
children and lend support to liquid biopsy screening for enhanced therapeutic 
stratification.

DNA methylation, a pivotal epigenetic mechanism, plays a critical role in 
various pathological conditions, including cancers. Notably, 
cancer-type-specific DNA methylation can be advantageous for survival only in 
specific environments while being disadvantageous in others. To investigate the 
role of cancer-type-specific methylation as a vulnerability in cancer cells, we 
bioinformatically profiled genome-wide DNA methylation in 1165 human cancer cell 
lines across 25 cancer types. The number of cancer-type-specific methylated 
cytosines varied significantly by organ, with exceptionally high numbers 
observed in blood cancers. A total of 73 genes were identified as potential 
liver cancer-specific methylation-silenced genes, and four genes, ASNS, NQO1, 
FXYD5, and BCAT2, were subjected to experimental further analysis. Silencing of 
BCAT2 was found to contribute to the vulnerability of liver cancer cells to 
BCAT1 inhibition by gabapentin. Additionally, the silencing of the other three 
genes also rendered liver cancer cells vulnerable under different environmental 
conditions. These findings enhance our understanding of the biological and 
clinical significance of DNA methylation and provide a basis for developing 
diagnostic markers for cancer. (169 words).

BACKGROUND AND AIM: The study aims to investigate the potential causal effects 
of lipids on liver cancer risk and to analyze the possible impact of 
lipid-lowering drug targets on liver cancer.
METHODS: Genetic variants linked to lipid traits and drug targets were obtained 
from the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium and DrugBank. Liver cancer data were 
sourced from FinnGen. Mendelian randomization (MR) was used to assess causal 
relationships between lipid traits and liver cancer. Functional analyses 
included protein-protein interaction (PPI), KEGG pathway enrichment, 
transcription factor (TF) network analysis, and survival analysis. NPC1L1 
expression, DNA methylation, and immune infiltration were analyzed using UALCAN, 
TCGA-LIHC, and TIMER, respectively.
RESULTS: MR analysis showed higher genetically predicted LDL-C levels reduced 
liver cancer risk (OR = 0.5981, p = 0.034). Drug target MR indicated that NPC1L1 
inhibition (OR = 1.0638, p = 0.0311) and elevated PPARɑ levels (OR = 1.1339, 
p < 0.01) increased liver cancer risk. Functional analysis revealed NPC1L1 was 
highly expressed in liver cancer tissues due to hypomethylation and linked to 
immune cell infiltration, indicating its role in immune evasion and tumor 
progression.
CONCLUSION: The study demonstrates that elevated LDL-C levels are associated 
with a reduced risk of liver cancer and NPC1L1 plays a key role in regulating 
lipid metabolism and influencing immune evasion.

BACKGROUND: BRCA1/2 Mutations have been linked to an inherited risk of breast 
and ovarian cancer. However, gene silencing by promoter methylation of BRCA1 and 
BRCA2 has not been studied extensively.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Promoter methylation of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in the gDNA of 
113 hereditary breast and ovarian cancer patients was carried out using 
methylation-specific qPCR.
RESULTS: The majority of patients showed higher methylation in BRCA2 than in 
BRCA1 and were significantly associated with hereditary breast and ovarian 
cancer Moreover, BRCA2 methylation was significantly associated with BRCA2 
downregulation. Additionally, protein expression analysis in a subset of 25 
patients with hypermethylated demonstrated a significant negative correlation 
between methylation status and protein expression for both BRCA1 and BRCA2.
CONCLUSION: BRCA1 and BRCA2 promoter methylation, particularly BRCA2, 
contributes to gene silencing and protein loss, and may act as key biomarkers 
for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer prognosis and therapy.

Background: The incidence of malignant melanoma (MM) continues to increase 
annually, and tumour invasiveness is a main prognostic factor. Single-nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) have become key tools in the study of cancer genetics, 
influencing susceptibility and prognosis. Methods: In the present study, we 
analysed the relationship between five SNPs on the PDCDL1 gene (rs822336, 
rs822337, rs822338, rs229736, rs4143815) with prognosis as well as primary 
tumour invasiveness characteristics in 377 whole blood samples from MM 
individuals. Results: Patients who presented the rs822336 CG or GG genotypes (OR 
= 3.01, 95% CI = 1.53-5.92; p = 0.0017), TA or TT in rs822337 (OR = 2.45, 95% CI 
= 1.22-4.93; p = 0.0098), and CT or CC of rs822338 (OR = 2.23, 95% CI = 
1.05-4.73; p = 0.028) were at an increased risk of developing invasive 
melanomas. Cases with the AG or GG genotype in rs2297136 presented a lower risk 
(OR = 0.29, 95% CI = 0.11-0.75; p = 0.0038) of invasive MM. The genetic analysis 
at the haplotype level resulted in similar findings (OR: 2.95, 95% CI: 
1.08-8.10), p = 0.036). Furthermore, patients carrying the homozygous AA 
genotype in rs2297136 had thicker tumours than those harbouring the AG or GG 
(1.4 mm vs. 1.0 and 0.8 mm; p = 0.030). No significant association was found 
between the studied SNPs and melanoma-specific survival (MSS) nor 
progression-free survival (PFS). Conclusions: Current results suggest that SNPs 
rs822336, rs822337, rs822338, and rs2297136 genotypes in the PDCDL1 gene are 
associated with the risk of tumour invasiveness and tumour thickness in MM. 
Further studies on SNPs considering genetic and epigenetic factors are needed 
for a better understanding of malignant melanoma susceptibility and its 
prognosis.

BACKGROUND: The incidence of early-onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC) (< 50 years) 
has been steadily rising, with a parallel increase in metastatic and invasive 
cases. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying this aggressive 
phenotype, we performed comprehensive multi-omics profiling to delineate the 
distinct features of EOCRC, with a focus on key drivers of metastatic and 
invasive potential.
METHODS: We initially characterized the genome, epigenome, and transcriptome of 
tumors from 515 (69 EOCRC and 446 late-onset CRC [LOCRC]) cases in The Cancer 
Genome Atlas. Key candidate molecules were further validated using RNA-seq and 
scRNA-seq data. Multi-omics profiling revealed PIWIL1/piRNA as a hallmark of 
EOCRC, with further validation through in vitro functional assays, 
transcriptomic profiling, and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.
RESULTS: EOCRC demonstrated a mutational landscape similar to that of LOCRC, 
with comparable oncogenic driver mutations and somatic copy-number alterations. 
However, EOCRC exhibited a higher frequency of deletion in chromosomes 6, 15, 
and 19 regions, along with metabolic reprogramming favoring aerobic glycolysis 
and lipid metabolism. Integrative transcriptomic and DNA methylation analyses 
identified six EOCRC-specific molecules, including PIWIL1. Notably, PIWIL1 was 
mainly expressed in epithelial cells, with lower expression in EOCRC versus 
LOCRC. Its downstream piRNAs (FR019019, FR019089, and FR132045) were also 
downregulated in EOCRC. Functional experiments demonstrated that 
FR019089/FR019019 overexpression suppressed migration and invasion. Clinically, 
low FR019089 levels correlated with significantly shorter progression-free and 
overall survival in EOCRC patients. Additionally, downstream pathways of 
FR019089 and FR019019 overexpression were enriched in anti-cancer-related 
signaling pathways.
CONCLUSIONS: Our multi-omics approach yields novel insights into the molecular 
underpinnings of EOCRC and we characterize the role of PIWIL1-associated piRNAs 
in modulating EOCRC metastasis and invasion. FR019089 shows promise as a 
prognostic biomarker with potential clinical utility in the risk stratification 
and management of EOCRC patients.

Maintenance of the mitochondrial inner membrane potential (ΔΨm) is critical for 
many aspects of mitochondrial function. While ΔΨm loss and its consequences are 
well studied, little is known about the effects of mitochondrial 
hyperpolarization. In this study, we used cells deleted of ATP5IF1 (IF1), a 
natural inhibitor of the hydrolytic activity of the ATP synthase, as a genetic 
model of increased resting ΔΨm. We found that the nuclear DNA hypermethylates 
when the ΔΨm is chronically high, regulating the transcription of mitochondrial, 
carbohydrate and lipid genes. These effects can be reversed by decreasing the 
ΔΨm and recapitulated in wild-type (WT) cells exposed to environmental chemicals 
that cause hyperpolarization. Surprisingly, phospholipid changes, but not redox 
or metabolic alterations, linked the ΔΨm to the epigenome. Sorted hyperpolarized 
WT and ovarian cancer cells naturally depleted of IF1 also showed phospholipid 
remodeling, indicating this as an adaptation to mitochondrial hyperpolarization. 
These data provide a new framework for how mitochondria can impact epigenetics 
and cellular biology to influence health outcomes, including through chemical 
exposures and in disease states.

Targeted radiotherapy is integral to the increasing survival of cancer patients; 
however, it has significant side effects, the underlying cellular and molecular 
mechanisms of which are ill-defined. It is well documented that targeted 
radiotherapy induces epigenetic changes in neoplastic tissue, which impacts 
tumour evolution; however, whether epigenetic deregulation also occurs in the 
surrounding non-neoplastic tissue and contributes to the occurrence of side 
effects is unknown. We characterized the DNA methylome in a unique cohort of 
irradiated peri-lesional brain tissue samples and integrated it with gene 
expression analysis at the spatial level. We show differences in DNA methylation 
patterns in irradiated brain tissue and identify specific inflammatory 
micro-environmental niches and their regulatory neuropeptides after irradiation. 
Finally, we show in a cerebral organoid model, that the same neuropeptides are 
upregulated as well as similar DNA methylation alterations and disruption of the 
DNA methylation machinery, in keeping with the interpretation that epigenetic 
dysregulation plays a role in neurotoxicity, hence raising the possibility it 
could represent a novel target for the reduction of radiotherapy side effects.

BACKGROUND/AIM: Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is an essential 
enzyme in folate metabolism, playing a critical role in DNA methylation and 
nucleotide synthesis. Variants of the MTHFR gene have been associated with 
varying susceptibility to brain tumors, particularly gliomas. This study aimed 
to investigate the role of MTHFR genotypes in determining brain tumor risk in 
Taiwan.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this hospital-based case-control study, we assessed 
the contribution of MTHFR C677T (rs1801133) and A1298C (rs1801131) genotypes to 
brain tumor risk. A total of 52 patients with brain tumor and 520 age- and 
sex-matched non-cancer healthy controls were included. Genotyping of MTHFR 
rs1801133 and rs1801131 was performed using polymerase chain 
reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP).
RESULTS: Our findings revealed a significant difference in the genotypic 
distribution of MTHFR rs1801131 between brain tumor cases and non-cancer 
controls (p for trend=0.0099). Specifically, individuals with the MTHFR 
rs1801131 homozygous CC genotype demonstrated a 3.69-fold increased risk of 
brain tumors [95% confidence interval (95%CI)=1.52-9.00, p=0.0062]. In contrast, 
the AC genotype did not show a statistically significantly increased risk [odds 
ratio (OR)=1.54, 95%CI=0.83-2.85, p=0.2278]. Allelic frequency analysis revealed 
that the C allele of MTHFR rs1801131 was associated with an elevated risk of 
brain tumors (OR=1.83, 95%CI=1.20-2.80, p=0.0071). No significant association 
was found for MTHFR rs1801133. Stratified analysis showed that the MTHFR 
rs1801131 CC genotype particularly increased the risk in individuals older than 
60 years (OR=4.68, 95%CI=1.42-15.42, p=0.0202) and in females (OR=3.79, 
95%CI=1.22-11.77, p=0.0410).
CONCLUSION: The CC genotype of MTHFR rs1801131 may serve as a valuable marker 
for brain tumor susceptibility. Stratifying patients with brain tumors based on 
their MTHFR genotypes could help identify individuals at high risk, enabling 
more frequent monitoring and preventive measures to reduce the occurrence of 
brain tumors in Taiwan.

BACKGROUND/AIM: Periodontitis is a prevalent multifactorial, oral infectious 
disease and is considered a high-risk factor for pancreatic cancer. 
Nevertheless, there is limited understanding of the underlying epigenetic 
mechanisms governing this relationship. The aim of this study was to identify 
dysregulated miRNAs associated with periodontitis and pancreatic cancer, along 
with their related genes, signaling pathways, and compounds.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: miRNA expression datasets for tissues affected by 
periodontitis and pancreatic cancer were obtained from the Gene Expression 
Omnibus database. miRNAs differentially expressed relative to normal tissues 
were detected, and those common to both datasets were determined. Further 
bioinformatics approaches were used to explore the association of common 
differentially expressed miRNAs with periodontitis and pancreatic cancer.
RESULTS: Twenty shared, differentially expressed miRNAs were identified; 14 
exhibited similar expression patterns in both diseases. Among these common 
differentially expressed miRNAs, 10 were found to be overexpressed. hsa-miR-155, 
hsa-miR-186, hsa-miR-765, hsa-miR-211 and hsa-miR-375 were the top miRNA nodes 
in the gene network, with hsa-mir-155 being the sole miRNA node in the 
transcription factor network. Top candidate miRNA-dysregulated genes included 
superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), nuclear FMR1 interacting protein 2 (NUFIP2), SFT2 
domain-containing 2 (SFT2D2), thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP), and 
cyclin D1 (CCND1), while top dysregulated transcription factors were Argonaute 
RISC catalytic component 2 (AGO2), AKT serine/threonine kinase 1 (AKT1), BCL6 
transcription repressor (BCL6), breakpoint cluster region (BCR), and BRCA1 DNA 
repair associated (BRCA1). Relevant compounds for targeting these emerged, 
including 5-fluorouracil, gemcitabine, doxorubicin, ascorbate, 
diethylstilbestrol, and temozolomide.
CONCLUSION: Our study suggests candidate molecular mechanisms linking 
periodontitis to pancreatic cancer, highlighting potential compounds that may 
target both diseases. These findings provide a foundation for guiding future 
fundamental and clinical research.

BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence suggests the unique susceptibility of estrogen 
receptor and progesterone receptor negative [ERPR(-)] breast cancer to dietary 
fat amount and type. Dietary n-3 (ω-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), such 
as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), may modulate 
breast adipose fatty acids and downstream metabolites to counteract 
procarcinogenic signaling in the mammary microenvironment.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to determine effects of ∼1 to 5 g/d EPA+DHA over 12 mo on 
breast adipose fatty acid and oxylipin profiles in survivors of ERPR(-) breast 
cancer, a high-risk molecular subtype.
METHODS: We conducted a proof-of-concept 12-mo randomized double-blind trial 
comparing ∼5 g/d and ∼1 g/d EPA+DHA supplementation in females within 5 y of 
completing standard therapy for ERPR(-) breast cancer Stages 0 to III. Blood and 
breast adipose tissue specimens were collected every 3 mo for fatty acid, 
oxylipin, and DNA methylation (DNAm) analyses.
RESULTS: A total of 51 participants completed the 12-mo intervention. Study 
treatments were generally well tolerated. Although both doses increased n-3 
PUFAs from baseline in breast adipose, erythrocytes, and plasma, the 5 g/d 
supplement was more potent with differences (% total fatty acids) of 0.76 (95% 
confidence interval [CI]: 0.56, 0.96), 6.25 (95% CI: 5.02, 7.48), and 5.89 (95% 
CI: 4.53, 7.25), respectively. The 5 g/d dose also reduced plasma triglycerides 
from baseline, with changes (mg/dL) of 27.38 (95% CI: 10.99, 43.78) and 24.58 
(95% CI: 9.05, 40.10) at 6 and 12 months, respectively. Breast adipose oxylipins 
showed dose-dependent increases in DHA and EPA metabolites. Distinct DNAm 
patterns in adipose tissue after 12 mo suggest potential downregulation of 
aberrant lipid metabolism pathways at the 5 g/d dose.
CONCLUSIONS: Over 1 y, EPA+DHA dose-dependently increased breast adipose 
concentrations of these fatty acids and their derivative oxylipin metabolites 
and produced differential DNAm profiles involved in metabolism-related pathways 
critical to ERPR(-) breast cancer development. This distinct metabolic and 
epigenetic modulation of the breast microenvironment is achievable with 
high-dose n-3 PUFA supplementation. This trial was registered at 
clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02295059.

While environmental and lifestyle factors contribute to urothelial carcinoma 
(UC) development, their differential effects on bladder cancer (UB) versus upper 
tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) and the underlying epigenetic mechanisms 
remain unclear. This study investigated location-specific risk factors and the 
mediating role of LINE-1 DNA methylation in UC carcinogenesis. A hospital-based 
case-control study was conducted, comprising 478 UC cases (266 UB, 204 UTUC) and 
569 controls. The risk factors, including smoking, Chinese herbal medicine use, 
comorbidities, and blood levels of arsenic, cadmium, and lead, were assessed 
through questionnaires and blood sample analysis. LINE-1 DNA methylation levels 
were measured by pyrosequencing. LASSO regression for variable selection and 
logistic regression for risk assessment. Mediation analysis was performed to 
evaluate the role of LINE-1 DNA methylation in the relationship between 
environmental exposures and UC risk. UB risk was associated with male sex, 
smoking, chronic kidney disease (CKD), elevated blood arsenic, and diabetes (all 
p < 0.0001), while UTUC risk was primarily linked to female sex (p = 0.0004) and 
CKD (p < 0.0001). LINE-1 hypermethylation was associated with both UB and UTUC 
risk (p < 0.0001). Notably, LINE-1 methylation significantly mediated the 
relationship between smoking and UC risk, particularly in males, while no 
significant mediation was observed for other exposures. This study demonstrates 
distinct risk profiles for UB and UTUC, and identifies LINE-1 methylation as a 
key mediator in smoking-related UC risk, especially in men. These findings 
suggest the need for location-specific prevention strategies and highlight the 
importance of epigenetic mechanisms in UC development.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a multifactorial and age-related disease. 
Additionally, age, sex, and risk factors for developing CRC may include genetic, 
epigenetic, and immunologic characteristics and lifestyle habits. Simultaneous 
examination of gene mutations and their products is vital for determining 
patient prognosis and treatment. Therefore, we assessed APC, KRAS, and TP53 
plasma levels; inflammatory indices; and KRAS mutations in CRC patients and 
evaluated their role in cancer progression. The study population consisted of 
colorectal cancer patients (40 patients: 16 women and 24 men). KRAS mutations 
were detected using real-time PCR; APC, KRAS, and TP53 protein levels were 
measured via ELISA. The results revealed that inflammatory indices (MLR, PLR, 
NLR) are increased in CRC patients, especially in those with advanced stages. 
TP53 protein levels were increased in patients with progressive cancer, whereas 
no significant difference was detected in the plasma levels of APC and KRAS. The 
G12V KRAS mutation was associated with a poor prognosis and high PLR values. Our 
findings reveal that inflammatory indices such as the MLR, PLR, and NLR are 
linked to TP53 and APC plasma levels and offer new insights into their role in 
the development and progression of CRC.

This pilot study introduces the concept of a ""redox clock,"" an NRF2-based 
epigenetic clock that reflects age-related changes in oxidative stress 
regulation. We examined CpG methylation of the NRF2 promoter across two 
independent populations: 101 healthy participants (56 males, 45 females) from 
Gyeongsang National University Hospital (GNUH) and 150 healthy participants (111 
males, 39 females) from the National Cancer Center (NCC). Methylation-sensitive 
HpaII restriction enzyme assays targeted three promoter regions (A, B, and C), 
while Illumina MethylationEPIC microarray analysis identified two specific CpG 
sites (cg03988329 and cg15484591) that correlated significantly with age 
(p < 0.01). Males, in particular, showed heightened CpG methylation in regions A 
and C with advancing age, alongside higher Ct values for NRF2 and HO-1 
transcripts, indicating reduced gene expression. Using these methylation 
patterns, we developed the ""redox clock"" to model accelerated aging (AA). 
Notably, this redox clock discriminated prediagnostic lung cancer cases from 
healthy controls by revealing significantly greater AA in the cancer cohort, 
whereas established epigenetic clocks (Horvath, Hannum, and PhenoAge) did not 
detect this difference. These findings support CpG methylation of the NRF2 
promoter, as captured by the redox clock, as a promising biomarker for 
biological aging and potential risk assessment for age-related diseases such as 
lung cancer.

BACKGROUND: The current noninvasive prognostic evaluation methods for 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which are largely reliant on radiographic 
imaging features and serum biomarkers such as alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), have 
limited effectiveness in discriminating patient outcomes. Identification of new 
prognostic biomarkers is a critical unmet need to improve treatment 
decision-making. Epigenetic changes in cell-free DNA (cfDNA) have shown promise 
in early cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Thus, we aim to evaluate the potential 
of cfDNA methylation as a noninvasive predictor for prognostication in patients 
with active, radiographically viable HCC.
METHODS: Using Illumina HumanMethylation450 array data of 377 HCC tumors and 50 
adjacent normal tissues obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we 
identified 158 HCC-related DNA methylation markers associated with overall 
survival (OS). This signature was further validated in 29 HCC tumor tissue 
samples. Subsequently, we applied the signature to an independent cohort of 52 
patients with plasma cfDNA samples by calculating the cfDNA methylation-based 
risk score (methRisk) via random survival forest models with 10-fold 
cross-validation for the prognostication of OS.
RESULTS: The cfDNA-based methRisk showed strong discriminatory power when 
evaluated as a single predictor for OS (3-year AUC = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.68-0.94). 
Integrating the methRisk with existing risk indices like Barcelona clinic liver 
cancer (BCLC) staging significantly improved the noninvasive prognostic 
assessments for OS (3-year AUC = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.80-1), and methRisk remained an 
independent predictor of survival in the multivariate Cox model (P = 0.007).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study serves as a pilot study demonstrating that cfDNA 
methylation biomarkers assessed from a peripheral blood draw can stratify HCC 
patients into clinically meaningful risk groups. These findings indicate that 
cfDNA methylation is a promising noninvasive prognostic biomarker for HCC, 
providing a proof-of-concept for its potential clinical utility and laying the 
groundwork for broader applications.

Histone methylation is an important epigenetic modification process coordinated 
by histone methyltransferases, histone demethylases and histone methylation 
reader proteins and plays a key role in the occurrence and development of 
cancer. This study constructed a risk scoring model around histone methylation 
modification regulators and conducted a multidimensional comprehensive analysis 
to reveal its potential role in breast cancer prognosis and drug sensitivity. 
First, 144 histone methylation modification regulators (HMMRs) were subjected to 
differential analysis and univariate Cox regression analysis, and nine 
differentially expressed HMMRs associated with survival were screened out. Next, 
a risk scoring model consisting of eight HMMRs was constructed using the LASSO 
regression algorithm, exhibiting independent predictive values in training and 
validation cohorts. Then, immune analysis shows that patients in the high-risk 
group divided by the risk scoring model has weakened the immune response. In 
addition, through functional analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) 
between high-risk and low-risk groups, we confirmed that the DEGs mainly 
affected the nucleoplasm and tumour microenvironment. Finally, drug sensitivity 
analysis demonstrated that our model could be useful for drug screening and 
identify potential drugs for treating BRCA patients. In conclusion, these eight 
HMMRs may be key factors in the prognosis and drug sensitivity of BRCA patients.

School meal service workers may face an increased risk of lung cancer due to the 
nature of their work. This study aims to assess environmental exposure levels 
during occupational cooking among these workers in Seoul, Korea, and to examine 
the associations with carcinogen-associated biomarkers. Additionally, the study 
seeks to verify lung carcinogenesis through experiments using lung organoids 
treated with carcinogens, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and 
particulate matter. Here, we introduce the study protocol and outline our 
research strategies. This etiome study employs molecular epidemiological 
approaches involving at least 200 school meal service workers from 25-30 school 
cafeterias in Seoul, as well as in vitro lung organoid experiments. The study 
includes a questionnaire survey to analyze workers' occupational environments, 
focusing on exposure to hazardous substances such as cooking oil fumes and 
assessing the use of personal protective equipment (e.g., masks) and the 
presence of ventilation systems. We measure molecular epigenomic biomarkers, 
including PAH adducts and metabolites along with methylation markers, in the 
exposure and control groups. Additionally, lung organoid experiments are 
performed to investigate the potential for lung cancer development due to 
respiratory carcinogen exposure in cooks. This study is expected to contribute 
to health risk assessments and the establishment of preventive strategies for 
meal service workers.

BACKGROUND: Epigenetic aging measures have promise as surrogate health outcomes 
in randomized control trials and observational cohort studies. The value of 
these measures, however, will reflect the extent to which they are associated 
with prospective health outcomes in real-world medical settings.
METHODS: Using data from 2 216 post-9/11 veterans from the VISN 6 MIRECC's 
Post-Deployment Mental Health Study, we examined whether accelerated epigenetic 
aging, assessed by DunedinPACE, was associated with prospective chronic disease 
morbidity, predicted healthcare costs, and mortality over an average of 13.1 
years of electronic health record follow-up.
RESULTS: Veterans with faster DunedinPACE aging scores developed more chronic 
disease over the subsequent 5 years (RR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.14-1.36), 10 years (RR, 
1.31; 95% CI, 1.21-1.40), and 15 years (RR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.22-1.52). Faster 
aging scores were also associated with increases in predicted healthcare costs 
over the next 5 years (β = 0.08; 95% CI, 0.03-0.13), 10 years (β = 0.23, 95% CI, 
0.15-0.31), and 15 years (β = 0.21; 95% CI, 0.11-0.30). Faster DunedinPACE aging 
scores were associated with greater risk for incident myocardial infarction 
(84%), stroke (38%), diabetes (56%), cancer (25%), liver disease (44%), and 
renal disease (34%), as well as greater risk of mortality due to all-causes 
(38%) and chronic disease (74%). These results remained when adjusting for 
demographic, biomarker, and smoking covariates.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest DunedinPACE is a biomarker of accelerated 
aging that is prospectively associated with chronic disease morbidity and 
mortality, as assessed using health records from an integrated healthcare 
system.

Approximately half of high-grade ovarian cancers are characterized by genetic 
and epigenetic alterations in genes involved in homologous recombination repair 
(HRR), most commonly BRCA1 and BRCA2. HRR defects (HRD) identified by tests of 
genomic instability confer PARP inhibitor sensitivity in ovarian cancers. 
Commercial tests that combine tumor BRCA testing with a genomic instability 
score (HRD test) are available in clinical practice. We seek to determine the 
performance of three different HRD tests to improve therapy management and 
prevention of ovarian cancer. Tumor samples from 50 patients with high-grade 
ovarian cancers were investigated for tumoral BRCA status, genomic instability, 
and BRCA1 promoter methylation for treatment purposes. Patients with ovarian 
cancer that tested positive for BRCA variants and/or genomic instability defect 
were referred to the Cancer Genetics Service for germline testing. A positive 
HRD status was observed in 54% of cases, and pathogenic variants in BRCA genes 
were identified in 41% of cases presenting genomic instability. BRCA1 
methylation assay revealed promoter hypermethylation in 20% of ovarian cancers 
that tested positive for HRD and negative for BRCA1/2 variants. Among 26 women 
referred to cancer genetic counseling, 10 carried germline variants in HRR 
genes. HRD status determined eligibility for PARP inhibitor treatment in all but 
two ovarian cancers. This study outlines that determining genomic instability 
helps identify inherited ovarian cancers. HRD testing, crucial for making 
high-grade ovarian cancer treatment choices, must be linked to an established 
path of cancer genetic counseling and management of individuals at high cancer 
risk.
PREVENTION RELEVANCE: Genomic instability status (HRD testing), which is 
essential for making therapy choices, is useful to identify inherited ovarian 
cancers. Identifying these families with high cancer risk is critical for 
implementing targeted cancer prevention strategies.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer-related morbidity and 
mortality, influenced by both genetic and epigenetic factors. Long non-coding 
RNAs (lncRNAs) such as GAS5 and CASC8 have been implicated in cancer 
susceptibility. This study aimed to assess the association of GAS5 rs145204276 
ins/del and CASC8 rs10505477 A>G polymorphisms with CRC risk in a Romanian 
population. A case-control study was conducted, including 156 CRC patients and 
195 healthy controls. Genotyping for GAS5 and CASC8 polymorphisms was performed 
using real-time PCR, and the association with CRC risk was evaluated using 
logistic regression to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals 
(CI). The carriers of GAS5 rs145204276 del allele was significantly associated 
with increased CRC risk (OR: 2.13, 95% CI: 1.24-3.63, p = 0.005) in a dominant 
model. In the subgroup analysis, the association of GAS5 rs145204276 ins/del 
polymorphism was restricted to distal colon cancer cases (OR: 2.98, 95% CI: 
1.57-5.66, p = 0.001), advanced tumor stages (III + IV) (OR: 2.54, 95% CI: 
1.31-4.91, p = 0.007), and poorly differentiated tumors (G3) (OR: 3.98, 95% CI: 
1.49-10.59, p = 0.009). No significant correlation was found for the CASC8 
rs10505477 A>G polymorphism. GAS5 rs145204276 polymorphism may influence CRC 
susceptibility, particularly in distal tumors and advanced stages. However, 
CASC8 rs10505477 polymorphism showed no association with CRC risk in this 
Romanian cohort.

Despite significant advancements in early detection and treatment, 
non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related 
mortality. Specifically, in early-stage cases, recurrence after surgery 
continues to be the principal cause of death for these patients. The urgent need 
for novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers has directed attention towards 
PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), a group of small RNAs that regulate genomic 
stability and epigenetics. Some piRNAs, including hsa_piR_022710, 
hsa_piR_019822, and hsa_piR_020840, have been described as deregulated in 
various cancers. This study investigated the expression of these three piRNAs by 
RT-qPCR in 277 NSCLC patients and developed survival and CART classification 
models to predict recurrence risk, overall survival (OS), and disease-free 
survival (DFS). hsa_piR_019822 and hsa_piR_020840 were able to discriminate 
between tumor and normal tissue, as well as between adenocarcinoma and squamous 
cell carcinoma (LUSC) patients. Elevated expression of hsa_piR_019822 and 
hsa_piR_022710 was correlated with an increased risk of recurrence and poorer 
DFS and OS in LUSC patients. Patients with high hsa_piR_022710 expression more 
greatly benefited from adjuvant treatment. In summary, higher piRNA levels were 
associated with an increased risk of recurrence and poorer survival outcomes, 
especially in LUSC patients, where they may help guide personalized treatment 
strategies.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) exhibits high de novo recurrence 
rates post-resection. Current post-surgery recurrence prediction methods are 
limited, emphasizing the need for reliable biomarkers to assess recurrence risk. 
We aimed to develop methylation-based markers for classifying HCC patients and 
predicting their risk of de novo recurrence post-surgery.
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we analyzed data from HCC patients 
who underwent surgical resection in Korea, excluding those with recurrence 
within one year post-surgery. Using the Infinium Methylation EPIC array on 140 
samples in the discovery cohort, we classified patients into low- and high-risk 
groups based on methylation profiles. Distinctive markers were identified 
through random forest analysis. These markers were validated in the cancer 
genome atlas (n=217), Validation cohort 1 (n=63) and experimental Validation 
using a methylation-sensitive high-resolution melting (MS-HRM) assay in 
Validation cohort 1 and Validation cohort 2 (n=63).
RESULTS: The low-risk recurrence group (methylation group 1; MG1) showed a 
methylation average of 0.73 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.69-0.77) with a 
23.5% recurrence rate, while the high-risk group (MG2) had an average of 0.17 
(95% CI 0.14-0.20) with a 44.1% recurrence rate (P<0.03). Validation confirmed 
the applicability of methylation markers across diverse populations, showing 
high accuracy in predicting the probability of HCC recurrence risk (area under 
the curve 96.8%). The MS-HRM assay confirmed its effectiveness in predicting de 
novo recurrence with 95.5% sensitivity, 89.7% specificity, and 92.2% accuracy.
CONCLUSION: Methylation markers effectively classified HCC patients by de novo 
recurrence risk, enhancing prediction accuracy and potentially offering 
personalized management strategies.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) progression from adenoma to adenocarcinoma 
is associated with global reduction in 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 
5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). DNA hypomethylation continues upon liver 
metastasis. Here we examine 5hmC changes upon progression to liver metastasis.
RESULTS: 5hmC is increased in metastatic liver tissue relative to the primary 
colon tumour and expression of TET2 and TET3 is negatively correlated with risk 
for metastasis in patients with CRC. Genes associated with increased 
5-hydroxymethylcytosine show KEGG enrichment for adherens junctions, 
cytoskeleton and cell migration around a core cadherin (CDH2) network. Overall, 
the 5-hydroxymethylcyosine profile in the liver metastasis is similar to normal 
colon appearing to recover at many loci where it was originally present in 
normal colon and then spreading to adjacent sites. The underlying sequences at 
the recover and spread regions are enriched for SALL4, ZNF770, ZNF121 and PAX5 
transcription factor binding sites. Finally, we show in a zebrafish migration 
assay using SW480 CRISPR-engineered TET knockout and rescue cells that reduced 
TET expression leads to a reduced migration frequency.
CONCLUSIONS: Together these results suggest a biphasic trajectory for 
5-hydroxymethyation dynamics that has bearing on potential therapeutic 
interventions aimed at manipulating 5-hydroxymethylcytosine levels.

BACKGROUND: Precision cancer risk stratification for gastric cancer is urgently 
needed for the growing number of healthy people after Helicobacter pylori 
eradication. The epimutation burden in non-malignant tissues has been associated 
with cancer risk in multiple cross-sectional studies.
OBJECTIVE: To confirm the clinical usefulness of a DNA methylation marker for 
epimutation burden, and to identify a cut-off methylation level for a 
super-high-risk population.
DESIGN: Healthy people after H. pylori eradication with open-type atrophy were 
prospectively recruited. DNA methylation levels of a marker gene, RIMS1, were 
measured in biopsy specimens from gastric antrum and body. The primary endpoint 
was the incidence rate of gastric cancer in quartiles of the methylation levels.
RESULTS: 1624 participants had at least one endoscopic follow-up with a median 
follow-up of 4.05 years, and a primary gastric cancer developed in 27 
participants. The highest quartile of RIMS1 methylation levels had a higher 
incidence rate (972.8 per 100 000 person-years) than the lowest quartile 
(127.1). Cox regression analysis revealed a univariate HR of 7.7 (95% CI 
1.8-33.7) and an age- and sex-adjusted HR of 5.7 (95% CI 1.3-25.5). As a 
secondary objective, a cut-off methylation level of 25.7% (95% CI 1.7-7.7) was 
obtained to identify a population with a super-high risk based on the number 
needed to screen of 1000.
CONCLUSION: A DNA methylation marker can risk-stratify healthy people after H. 
pylori eradication even though all of them have clinically high risk. 
Individuals with super-high risk will need more frequent gastric cancer 
screening than currently recommended.

BACKGROUND: Occupational cancer and acute cardiac events are the leading causes 
of death among firefighters. Increased exposure to toxicants on the fire ground, 
such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, benzene, and per- and poly-fluoroalkyl 
substances (PFAS), has been linked to certain cancers, cardiovascular disease, 
accelerated epigenetic aging, and other adverse health effects. PFAS are a major 
concern because they are persistent, can bioaccumulate, and are present in 
several firefighting tools. Compared to the general population, firefighters 
have elevated serum levels of some types of PFAS. A randomized clinical trial in 
Australian firefighters found that routine blood and plasma donation for 1 year 
led to decreased serum PFAS levels, although health outcomes were not directly 
measured in that study.
OBJECTIVE: In collaboration with fire service leadership in Arizona, the 
Firefighter Collaborative Research Project (FCRP) was established to evaluate 
the effectiveness of 3 interventions in a randomized controlled trial design to 
reduce serum PFAS levels, reduce cancer and cardiovascular risk, and improve 
overall health and wellness in US firefighters.
METHODS: This study aimed to recruit and enroll up to 1500 active firefighters 
between August 2023 and October 2024. Between August 2023 and October 2024, 
active firefighters were recruited and randomized into a study arm based on 
their eligibility, including serum PFOS levels, for the specific arms. The trial 
arms include (1) blood and plasma donation, (2) zone 2 physical activity, and 
(3) intermittent fasting. FCRP outcomes include serum PFAS reduction (arm 1), 
epigenetic age acceleration (all arms), cardiovascular conditioning (arm 2) and 
cognitive outcomes (all arms), mental health (all arms), and overall disease 
risk (all arms). Each study arm includes an intervention and a control group. At 
enrollment and end of the study, participants provide blood and urine samples 
and complete a comprehensive questionnaire on their occupational and health 
history, exposures, and lifestyle behaviors. At the end of the study, 
participants also participated in a cognitive evaluation. Depending on the study 
arm, participants may additionally complete a cardiopulmonary exercise test at 
baseline and follow-up, a mid-study survey, and a mid-study blood and urine 
collection.
RESULTS: Participant activities and data collection will conclude by December 
2025.
CONCLUSIONS: The FCRP is a randomized controlled trial that aims to test the 
effectiveness of fire service-selected interventions in reducing serum PFAS 
levels. Study results will contribute to potential interventions that could be 
used to reduce serum PFAS levels in firefighters.

OBJECTIVES: To explore the role of a DNA methylation assay for managing 
minimally abnormal cervical cancer screening results in a prospective cohort 
undergoing opportunistic cervical cancer screening.
METHODS: In the cohort of the METHY2 and METHY3 screening studies of women 
undergoing opportunistic cervical cancer screening, cervical cytology samples 
were sent for high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) DNA assays, cytologic 
pathology and methylation assays of PAX1/JAM3 (CISCER). This study evaluated the 
discriminative power of CISCER in managing women with minimally abnormal 
cervical cancer screening results for CIN3+. Absolute CIN3+ risks and colposcopy 
referrals within one screening round were calculated.
RESULTS: A total of 1857 women with minimally abnormal cervical cancer findings 
had cervical histologic outcomes and were included in the analysis. In women 
with a minimally abnormal cervical cancer result, the sensitivity and 
specificity of CISCER was 74.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 68.3%-81.4%) and 
89.1% (95% CI 87.6%-90.6%) for detecting CIN3+. CISCER analysis discriminated 
well for minimally abnormal cervical cancer results, yielding a CIN3+ risk of 
40.5% (95% CI 34.9%-46.2%) after a positive result and a CIN3+ risk of 2.7% (95% 
CI 2.0%-3.6%) after a negative result.
CONCLUSIONS: In women with a minimally abnormal cervical cancer screening 
result, the CISCER provides excellent detection of CIN3+. The use of CISCER in 
women with a minimally abnormal cervical cancer screening result can lead to a 
substantial reduction in the number of direct colposcopy referrals.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the most prevalent type of gastrointestinal cancer. 
Genetic, epigenetic, and lifestyle factors have been implicated in the 
development of CRC. Non-coding RNAs such as HOX transcript antisense RNA 
(HOTAIR) and miR-3117 have been associated with cell proliferation, progression, 
invasion, and metastasis, as well as poor survival in several cancer types. This 
study examines the potential association between the HOTAIR (rs920778 T>C) and 
miR-3117 (rs7512692 C>T and rs4655646 G>A) variants and the clinicopathological 
features of CRC in Mexican patients. The study included genomic DNA of 
peripheral blood samples from 557 individuals (296 CRC patients and 261 
controls). The variants were identified by polymerase chain reaction-restriction 
fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). The association was calculated using 
the odds ratio (OR) test. P-values were adjusted using the Bonferroni test 
(0.016). Individuals carrying the T/C and C/C genotypes for the HOTAIR rs920778 
variant exhibited a higher susceptibility to CRC (OR=1.73, 95% CI: 1.15-2.58, 
P=0.009 and OR=2.78, 95% CI: 1.74-4.45, P=0.001, respectively). Male patients 
older than 50 years and carrying the C/C genotype demonstrated an increased 
susceptibility to developing CRC (OR=2.77, 95% CI: 1.63-4.70, P=0.001). 
Additionally, C/C genotype carriers exhibited an association with the advanced 
TNM stage. Furthermore, for the rs7512692 variant of the miR-3117 gene, patients 
carrying the C/T genotype exhibited increased susceptibility to developing CRC 
(OR=1.92, 95% CI: 1.35-2.74, P=0.001). Male patients over 50 years of age and 
carrying the C/T genotype demonstrated increased susceptibility for early TNM 
stages and tumor location in the colon. The results obtained suggest that the 
HOTAIR rs920778 and miR-3117 rs7512692 variants play a significant role in 
colorectal cancer risk.

Laryngeal cancer (LC) is a malignant tumor that occurs in the larynx. 
N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA methylation, a pivotal and prevalent epigenetic 
modification in eukaryotic mRNA, intricately intertwines with ferroptosis, and 
together, they play a crucial role in the development of LC. Accordingly, 
further research on related molecular mechanisms and pathology of LC is 
necessary. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis and correlation analysis 
were used to identify differentially expressed m6A-related ferroptosis genes in 
LC. The TCGA-HNSC and GSE65858 datasets were obtained from public databases. The 
TCGA-HNSC dataset consisted of 110 primary tumor oropharynx samples and 12 
control oropharynx samples, while the GSE65858 dataset contained forty-eight 
primary tumor oropharynx samples. Univariate Cox and least absolute shrinkage 
and selection operator (LASSO) regression were utilized for feature selection 
and risk model construction in the TCGA-HNSC dataset. The risk model was 
validated in the GSE65858 dataset. Then, a nomogram was built based on the 
independent prognostic factor identified using univariate and multivariate Cox 
regression in the TCGA-HNSC dataset. Mutation analysis, immune-related analysis, 
and drug sensitivity prediction were applied to analyze the utility of the risk 
model in the TCGA-HNSC dataset. Additionally, qRT-PCR and western blot were 
performed to detect the TFRC, RGS4, and FTH1 expression. Three biomarkers were 
identified to build a risk model using the univariate Cox and LASSO regression 
algorithms. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis verified the 
accuracy of the risk model. Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) and 
Estimation of STromal and Immune cells in MAlignant Tumors using the Expression 
data (ESTIMATE) algorithm showed a positive relationship between risk score and 
TIDE or ESTIMATE score. Furthermore, drug sensitivity prediction found that 19 
chemotherapy drugs were strongly correlated with a risk score. TFRC, RGS4, and 
FTH1 exhibited high expression levels in 30 laryngeal carcinoma tissues and cell 
lines. Notably, TFRC and FTH1 expression levels were significantly associated 
with patient prognosis. In Conclusion, TFRC, RGS4, and FTH1, were identified as 
m6A-regulated ferroptosis biomarkers in LC, providing insights into LC treatment 
and prognosis.

Thyroid carcinoma (THCA), the most prevalent endocrine system cancer, is rising 
worldwide. Granzyme family member GZMM causes tumor cell inflammation and 
programmed cell death. However, the role of GZMM in THCA has not been 
investigated. Bioinformatics analysis and assays showed that THCA GZMM protein 
levels were down-regulated and associated with certain clinicopathological 
features. Additionally, univariate and multivariate Cox analysis and ROC curve 
analysis showed that low GZMM expression was related with poor overall survival 
and might be employed as a prognostic and diagnostic factor. We used functional 
tests to examine how GZMM affected angiogenesis, invasion, and migration in 
vitro. TIMER showed a link between GZMM expression, immune cell infiltration, 
and tumor purity. Overexpression of GZMM also greatly boosted CD8 + T 
cell-attracting chemokines. TCGA data analysis yielded a GZMM and epigenetic 
modification-related gene risk prediction model. Overall, GZMM inhibits tumor 
invasion, migration, and angiogenesis, and is closely related to the immune 
microenvironment, significantly associated with poor prognosis in THCA patients.

Chronic alcohol exposure is a risk factor for developing esophageal squamous 
cell carcinoma (ESCC). To identify alcohol-responsive genes involved in 
esophageal carcinogenesis, we employed mouse models to systematically 
investigate alterations in cis-regulatory elements in the esophageal epithelium 
across different ethanol exposure durations. A key exposure duration, 16 weeks 
of exposure to 20% ethanol, corresponded with increased expression of 222 genes 
that correlated with ESCC progression and were enriched in pathways related to 
epithelial proliferation and oncogenesis. The construction of a comprehensive 
cis-regulatory element-gene map in human ESCC enables further evaluation of the 
role of the alcohol-responsive genes in ESCC susceptibility, identifying 
promoter and enhancer variants. A three-stage case-control study involving 9,033 
ESCC cases and 10,801 controls revealed an enhancer variant, rs10223516, in 
FOXP4 that was associated with ESCC susceptibility through gene-alcohol 
interaction. The rs10223516 variant modulated FOXP4 expression through a 
long-range interaction, with the T allele exhibiting higher enhancer activity. 
Alcohol drinkers with the TT genotype exhibited a 76% higher risk of developing 
ESCC than nondrinkers with the CC or TC genotype. Functional assays confirmed 
that the variant enhanced FOXP4 transcriptional activity, and upregulated FOXP4 
promoted ESCC development in vivo. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and 
RNA sequencing analyses further demonstrated that FOXP4 enhanced ESCC 
susceptibility and tumor growth by transcriptionally activating CYP26B1 and MYC. 
These findings highlight the complex gene-environment interactions between 
alcohol consumption and epigenetic alterations in esophageal tumorigenesis, 
offering potential targets for ESCC detection and prevention.
SIGNIFICANCE: An enhancer variant in FOXP4 mediates the interplay between 
alcohol consumption, epigenetic alterations, and esophageal carcinogenesis, 
which could inform development of early detection and prevention strategies.

BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are epigenetic regulators of T cell maturation 
and exhaustion. However, the mechanisms by which miRNAs influence T cell 
function in tumor environments remain unclear. This study focuses on miR-379-5p, 
which counteracts T cell exhaustion and enhances antitumor responses.
METHODS: Native CD8+ T cells were isolated from the blood of healthy donors and 
subjected to chronic stimulation to induce exhaustion. RNA sequencing and miRNA 
sequencing were performed to identify differentially expressed miRNAs. These 
miRNAs underwent bioinformatics analyses, including DESeq enrichment, immune 
cell infiltration assessment, and patient prognostic outcomes in The Cancer 
Genome Atlas data sets to assess their potential involvement in T cell 
exhaustion and antitumor immunity. The biological functions of miRNA on T cell 
differentiation, cytotoxic killing, and immune checkpoint regulation were 
investigated using in vitro assays, OT-I B16F10-OVA models, and patient-derived 
tumor organoids.
RESULTS: MiR-379-5p is downregulated in exhausted T cells and negatively 
associated with exhausted tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in advanced tumors. It 
correlates positively with better survival outcomes in breast cancer, cervical 
cancer and melanoma. In CD8+ T cells, miR-379-5p reduces the expression of 
immune checkpoint proteins T cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3 
(TIM3) and T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT) by targeting 
their 3' untranslated region. Overexpression of miR-379-5p in CD8+ T cell 
promotes differentiation into memory-like T effector cells and enhances 
cytotoxic killing of cancer cells. The transcription factor nuclear receptor 
subfamily 4 group A member 1 (NR4A1) with increased expression in exhausted T 
cells and negatively regulates miR-379, restoring immune checkpoint expression 
and suppressing cancer-killing ability. In contrast, OT-I T cells expressing 
ectopic miR-379-5p show increased cytotoxicity against B16F10-OVA tumors in 
mice. Autologous T cells isolated from patients with breast cancer transduced 
with miR-379-5p significantly improve killing of tumor organoids derived from 
the same patients.
CONCLUSIONS: MiR-379-5p acts as an epigenetic tumor suppressor by enhancing CD8+ 
T cell effector functions and suppressing T cell exhaustion. MiR-379-5p could 
represent a novel marker and strategy for cancer immunotherapy, offering 
promising avenues for enhancing antitumor immune responses.

Prostate cancer (PCa) ranks among the most prevalent cancers in men, noted for 
its high mortality rate and unfavorable prognosis. Estrogen-related genes (ERGs) 
are significantly associated with the progression of PCa. This investigation 
aims to comprehensively assess the prognosis of PCa based on ERGs and explore 
its underlying biological mechanisms. Univariate, multivariate, and Least 
Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression analyses were 
conducted to identify prognostic signature genes and build a prognostic model. 
The model's predictive performance was assessed using Receiver Operating 
Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), Gene 
Ontology (GO), and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment 
analyses were employed to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms of 
PCa. Antitumor drugs with high sensitivity were predicted using the CellMiner 
database and the pRRophitic package. Additionally, miRNAs targeting the 
identified signature genes were predicted using the miRNet database. This study 
identified six ERGs as prognostic biomarkers for PCa: POU4F1, BMP2, PGF, GAS1, 
GNAZ, and FGF11. The findings indicated that individuals in the low-risk 
category exhibited improved prognostic results. Notably, PCa progression may be 
closely linked to the cell adhesion molecule pathway and epigenetic regulation. 
Additionally, hsa-let-7a-5p and hsa-miR-34a-5p were identified as potential 
therapeutic regulators for PCa treatment. In conclusion, this research offers 
novel perspectives into the progression of PCa, providing robust scientific 
support for the development of personalized treatment strategies for PCa 
patients.

INTRODUCTION: Epigenetic biomarkers are molecular indicators of epigenetic 
changes, and some studies have suggested that these biomarkers have predictive 
power for disease risk. This study aims to analyze the relationship between 30 
epigenetic biomarkers and the risk of diabetes and cancer using machine learning 
modeling.
METHODS: The data for this study were sourced from the NHANES database, which 
includes DNA methylation arrays and epigenetic biomarker datasets. Nine machine 
learning algorithms were used to build models: AdaBoost, GBM, KNN, lightGBM, 
MLP, RF, SVM, XGBoost, and logistics. Model stability was evaluated using 
metrics such as Accuracy, MCC, and Sensitivity. The performance and 
decision-making ability of the models were displayed using ROC curves and DCA 
curves, while SHAP values were used to visualize the importance of each 
epigenetic biomarker.
RESULTS: Epigenetic age acceleration was strongly associated with cancer risk 
but had a weaker relationship with diabetes. In the diabetes model, the top 
three contributing features were logA1Mort, family income-to-poverty ratio, and 
marital status. In the cancer model, the top three contributing features were 
gender, non-Hispanic White ethnicity, and PACKYRSMort.
CONCLUSION: Our study identified the relationship between epigenetic biomarkers 
and the risk of diabetes and cancer, and used machine learning techniques to 
analyze the contributions of various epigenetic biomarkers to disease risk.

Epigenetic modification can be a key weapon employed by both sides of the battle 
between Cervical Cancer progression due to persistent high-risk papillomavirus 
(hr-HPV) infection and the development of anti-cancer modalities. Alongside the 
overactivated Wnt/β-catenin activity, reduced TET1 expression and ratio of 
5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) to 5-methylcytosine (5mC) were found in cervical 
cancer, which was correlated with lymph node metastasis. After treating cervical 
cancer cells with Resveratrol (RES), we found that TET1 expression was elevated 
and Wnt/β-catenin pathway activity was suppressed. Therefore, the aim of this 
study is to investigate the influence of resveratrol on the TET1 and 
Wnt/β-catenin pathways, and to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in 
this process, thereby clarifying the potential value of RES in the treatment of 
cervical cancer. Our data illustrate the TET1-mediated epigenetic modulation was 
an integral part of the effects of RES on the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in cervical 
cancer.

Exposure to benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) could lead to the development of lung cancer, 
but the potential mechanisms are complex and remain largely unclear. Plasma 
tRNA-derived small RNA (tsRNA), a new type epigenetic biomarker of cancer, might 
link environment exposure with lung cancer. Based on this case-control study of 
272 participants recruited from China, we aim to reveal the plasma tsRNA 
signature of lung cancer and their mediation effects on BaP-induced lung cancer. 
We sequenced tsRNA profiles and detected the adducts of Benzo[a]pyrene diol 
epoxide-albumin (BPDE-Alb) in plasma samples. We applied linear regression 
models to estimate associations between the adducts of BPDE-Alb, normalized 
tsRNA and the risk of lung cancer. We used mediation analysis to explore the 
mediation roles of tsRNAs in BaP-associated lung cancer. We identified 104 
tsRNAs significantly related to the risk of lung cancer (Bonferroni adjusted 
P < 0.05). Among these 104 tsRNAs, 17 tsRNAs were expressed at different 
concentrations between before and after lung cancer surgery groups with |fold 
change| > 2 at Bonferroni adjusted P < 0.05. In addition, of these 17 tsRNAs, 
the adducts of BPDE-Alb were associated with 5'-M-tRNA-Glu-CTC-1-1-L36, 
i-M-tRNA-Met-CAT-1-1-L24_pos29 and i-M-tRNA-Ala-AGC-2-2-L16_pos16, which could 
mediate a separate 40.8 %, 39.1 % and 36.8 % of the association between BaP 
exposure with lung cancer. Our study identified tsRNAs potentially mediating 
BaP-associated lung cancer development, and revealed tsRNAs as promising 
biomarkers of lung cancer.

Lung cancer is a highly lethal disease worldwide, resulting from a combination 
of genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors. The amplification of specific 
chromosomal regions is a hallmark of cancer progression; for instance, the 3q 
region of chromosome 3 is notably amplified in lung cancer, contributing to 
early tumor development. TP63, a member of the p53 family, is located in the 3q 
region. The presence of two distinct sets of TP63 isoforms (ΔNp63 and TAp63) 
complicates its functional role. Furthermore, miR-205-5p, a crucial player in 
cancer progression, has a predicted target site in the 5'-untranslated region 
(5'-UTR) of TAp63 transcripts. To investigate a potential correlation between 
miR-205-5p and the ΔNp63 and TAp63 isoforms, we conducted an in silico study 
followed by experimental validations on clinical tissue samples. We found a 
significant positive correlation between the expression of miR-205-5p and both 
isoforms of TP63 in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) datasets. The correlation between 
ΔNp63 and miR-205-5p was further confirmed in tissue samples from LUAD patients. 
Subsequently, we overexpressed ΔNp63α in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines and 
observed an upregulation of miR-205-5p, TAp63α, and DICER in the A549 cell line. 
Overexpression of ΔNp63α also inhibited the migration of A549 cells by reducing 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers and increasing 
mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) markers. We conducted a luciferase assay 
to investigate the direct interaction between miR-205-5p and the 5'-UTR of TAp63 
and observed a positive association. Overexpression of miR-205-5p in the A549 
cell line led to the upregulation of TAp63α and DICER. Additionally, we found a 
reduction in migration following miR-205-5p transfection. Based on these 
results, it appears that there is a ΔNp63α/miR-205-5p/TAp63α/DICER axis involved 
in the regulation of migration in lung adenocarcinoma, which is cell-specific.

Cancer stem cells are essential for initiation and therapy resistance of many 
cancers, including acute myeloid leukemias (AML). Here, we apply functional 
genomic profiling to diverse human leukemias, including high-risk MLL- and 
NUP98-rearranged specimens, using label tracing in vivo. Human leukemia 
propagation is mediated by a rare quiescent label-retaining cell (LRC) 
population undetectable by current immunophenotypic markers. AML quiescence is 
reversible, preserving genetic clonal competition and epigenetic inheritance. 
LRC quiescence is defined by distinct promoter-centered chromatin and gene 
expression dynamics controlled by an AP-1/ETS transcription factor network, 
where JUN is necessary and sufficient for LRC quiescence and associated with 
persistence and chemotherapy resistance in diverse patients. This enables 
prospective isolation and manipulation of immunophenotypically-varied leukemia 
stem cells, establishing the functions of epigenetic plasticity in leukemia 
development and therapy resistance. These findings offer insights into leukemia 
stem cell quiescence and the design of therapeutic strategies for their clinical 
identification and control.

PURPOSE: There is an urgent need to identify biomarkers of tumorigenesis for 
colitis-associated cancer (CAC) as early cancer detection remains crucial for 
patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This in silico study examines 
the relationship between IBD and CAC, with particular regard to 
differentially-expressed genes (DEGs).
METHODS: Integrated bioinformatics tools and public databases were employed. 
Data from GEO (GSE102133, GSE48958, GSE9348, GSE83687, GSE138202) were processed 
using GEOexplorer. DEGs were then functionally annotated with DAVID, SRplot, and 
integrated analysis via Metascape. Validation used Oncopression and Human 
Protein Atlas. Survival analysis employed GEPIA2. miRNA interactions were 
studied via miRTargetLink 2.0. Immune infiltration was analyzed with TIMER 2.0. 
COL1A1 expression and mutations were examined using cBioPortal, Kaplan-Meier 
plotter, and DNA methylation was analyzed using MethSurv. Correlation of COL1A1 
gene promoter methylation with tissue type and clinical data was performed using 
the UALCAN database. The ROC analysis of COL1A1 was conducted in the R 
environment.
RESULTS: Our analysis identified three potential hub genes (ICAM1, LAMC1, and 
COL1A1), which are overexpressed in IBD and cancer tissues compared to normal 
tissue, and hence may play a role in CAC. Furthermore, patients with lower 
COL1A1 expression had longer disease-free survival (p = 0.01) than those with 
higher expression. Therefore, this gene was chosen for further analysis and 
identified as the most crucial.
CONCLUSION: COL1A1 reveals significant immunohistochemistry, mutations, and 
methylation data. Further studies involving machine learning and clinical data 
are required to validate the results.

No study has systematically compared the suitability of DNA methylation (DNAme) 
profiles in non-invasive samples for the detection of breast cancer (BC). We 
assess non-tumour DNAme in 1,100 cervical, buccal, and blood samples from BC 
cases and controls and find that cervical samples exhibit the largest nuber of 
differentially methylated sites, followed by buccal samples. No sites were 
significant in blood after FDR adjustment. Deriving DNAme-based classifiers for 
BC detection in each sample type (WID-buccal-, cervical-, or blood-BC), we 
achieve validation AUCs of 0.75, 0.66, and 0.51, respectively. Buccal and 
cervical BC-associated DNAme alterations distinguish between BC cases and 
controls in both surrogate and breast tissue (AUC > 0.88), yet individual sites 
and the directionality of methylation changes are not identical between these 
two sample types, and buccal sample DNAme aligns with breast methylation changes 
more closely. Pending additional validation, these insights may have the 
potential to improve non-invasive personalized BC prevention.

Smoking has been identified as a major risk factor for the development and 
progression of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). As a key component of tobacco 
smoke, nicotine is believed to play a significant role in promoting NSCLC growth 
and progression. EZH2 is an epigenetic regulator highly expressed in the tumor 
tissues of smokers. However, whether and how nicotine regulates the expression 
of EZH2 and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Bioinformatics analysis 
and immunohistochemistry were used to compare the expression of EZH2 in NSCLC 
samples between smokers and nonsmokers. Western blotting, real-time quantitative 
PCR, and immunofluorescence were employed to confirm the effects of nicotine on 
EZH2 expression. Cell Counting Kit-8 assays, colony formation assays, 
5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine staining, and Transwell assays were conducted to 
analyze the proliferation and metastasis of A549 and H1650 cells treated with 
siRNA or EZH2 inhibitors. Real-time quantitative PCR and chromatin 
immunoprecipitation assays were performed to assess the regulatory effect of 
nicotine on EZH2 transcript levels via c-Myc. Coimmunoprecipitation and 
ubiquitination assays were used to assess the deubiquitination of c-Myc by 
OTUB1. Finally, a nude mouse model was used to evaluate the impact of combined 
c-Myc and EZH2 inhibitors on tumor proliferation and metastasis in vivo. EZH2 is 
expressed at relatively high levels in NSCLC patients, as determined by both 
bioinformatic and IHC analyses. Nicotine upregulates EZH2 expression and 
promotes the proliferation and metastatic ability of lung cancer cells. 
Inhibition of EZH2 with either DZNep or EPZ6438, EZH2 inhibitors, or siRNA 
significantly decreased the proliferative and metastatic capacity of NSCLC cells 
induced by nicotine treatment. Moreover, the study revealed that nicotine 
induces OTUB1 expression, stabilizes the c-Myc protein via deubiquitination, and 
enables c-Myc-mediated transcriptional activation of EZH2. Furthermore, the 
c-Myc inhibitor 10058-F4 exhibited synergistic effects with the EZH2 inhibitor 
DZNep in suppressing NSCLC cell proliferation and metastasis both in vitro and 
in vivo.Nicotine regulates the c-Myc/EZH2 signaling pathway via OTUB1-mediated 
deubiquitination, thereby promoting the proliferation and metastasis of NSCLC 
cells. This research reveals novel molecular mechanisms of nicotine in the 
development of NSCLC, providing a theoretical foundation for future therapeutic 
strategies.

Epigenomic mechanisms are critically involved in mediation of genetic and 
environmental factors that underlie cancer development. Histone modifications 
represent highly informative epigenomic marks that reveal activation and 
repression of gene activities and dysregulation of transcriptional control due 
to tumorigenesis. Here, we present a comprehensive epigenomic and transcriptomic 
mapping of 18 stage I and II tumor and 20 non-neoplastic tissues from non-small 
cell lung adenocarcinoma patients. Our profiling covers 5 histone marks 
including activating (H3K4me3, H3K4me1, and H3K27ac) and repressive (H3K27me3 
and H3K9me3) marks and the transcriptome using only 20 mg of tissue per sample, 
enabled by low-input omic technologies. Using advanced integrative bioinformatic 
analysis, we uncover cancer-driving signaling cascade networks, changes in 3D 
genome modularity, differential expression and functionalities of transcription 
factors and noncoding RNAs. Many of these identified genes and regulatory 
molecules show no significant change in their expression or a single epigenomic 
modality, emphasizing the power of integrative multimodal and multiomic analysis 
using patient samples.

Some cancers are strongly associated with exposure to environmental carcinogens, 
and genetic and epigenetic alterations are crucial in carcinogenesis. However, 
the interaction between genetic mutations and epigenetic regulation in cancer 
development has not been sufficiently examined. Here, we investigated the roles 
of gene mutations and altered circRNA expression in the malignant transformation 
of human bronchial epithelial cells after continuous exposure to CdCl2 (10 µM). 
The circular RNA circ_0007095 was down-regulated, and the SETBP1-R54P single 
nucleotide variant (SNV) accumulated during Cd carcinogenesis. The decreased 
circ_0007095 expression enhanced CdCl2-induced cancer cell proliferation, 
migration and tumor formation, and the accumulation of SETBP1-R54P also promoted 
CdCl2-induced carcinogenesis. Mechanistic studies showed that SETBP1-R54P 
mutation promoted circ_0007095 degradation by activating the KLF4-PFKP axis in 
the RNA degradation pathway. SETBP1-R54P mutation promoted the malignant 
transformation of Cd-induced 16HBE cells by regulating circ_0007095 expression. 
Our findings emphasize the importance of the interaction between genetic 
variation and epigenetic regulation during environmental chemical carcinogenesis 
and advance understanding of cancer etiology.

5-Hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) plays a key role in the DNA demethylation process 
and serves as a stable epigenetic marker in the human genome which is closely 
associated with disease progression, particularly in diabetes, colorectal 
cancer, and liver cancer. However, convenient and sensitive methods for 
detecting and quantifying 5hmC in the genome are scarce, especially in complex 
biological environments. Herein, a novel attempt at hypersensitive quantitative 
detection of 5hmC was presented. A multifunctional photosensitive probe was 
therefore introduced for specific labeling, enrichment, and elution of 5hmC-DNA. 
Combining with isothermal assay leveraging rolling circle amplification and 
Cas12a for accurate recognition, we achieved quantitative detection of 5hmC DNA 
in trace amounts at a level of 11 fM. Global 5hmC was measured in various 
biological samples using as little as 10 ng of input DNA by a real-time PCR 
instrument. The reported approach imposed no sequence restrictions, 
demonstrating promising potential for detecting modified bases in trace amounts 
of nucleic acids within complex environments, such as blood, urine, and saliva 
samples.

Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) span a broad clinical spectrum, from 
indolent neoplasms to life-threatening metastatic tumors. A persistent 
limitation of current risk stratification systems is that a subset of GISTs is 
graded as low-risk but nevertheless metastasizes. Therefore, new predictive 
factors that improve risk stratification are needed. In this exploratory study, 
we investigated the potential of genome-wide DNA methylation profiling and copy 
number variation (CNV) analysis as additional prognostic tools for GISTs. We 
collected a cohort of 28 patients with GIST diagnosed between 2001 and 2022, 
with available follow-up and molecular data. This included 15 patients without 
progressive disease (seven low-risk and eight moderate- to high-risk GISTs) and 
13 with progressive disease. Among those with progression, eight experienced 
recurrence or metastasis post-surgery (one low-risk, seven high-risk GISTs), 
while five had metastatic disease at initial diagnosis. Risk stratification was 
determined according to Miettinen's criteria. Genome-wide DNA methylation data 
and CNV plots were generated from imatinib-naïve primary GISTs using the 
Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip array. Unsupervised cluster analysis 
revealed distinct DNA methylation patterns predominantly associated with 
anatomical location and genotype. Differential DNA methylation analysis 
comparing primary gastric GISTs associated with and without progressive disease 
showed 8 differentially methylated regions spanning the coding and promoter 
areas of 6 genes. CNV analysis demonstrated that GISTs associated with 
progressive disease had the most CNVs, whereas low-risk, non-progressive GISTs 
had the fewest. Despite the limited sample size, this exploratory study 
indicates that genome-wide DNA methylation profiling and CNV analysis could 
enhance GIST risk stratification.

BACKGROUND: Blood DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles have been used to show that 
changes in circulating leukocyte composition occur during breast cancer 
development, suggesting that peripheral immune system alterations are markers of 
breast cancer risk. Blood DNAm profiles have recently been used to predict 
plasma protein concentrations (""Protein EpiScores""), but their associations with 
breast cancer risk have not been examined in detail.
METHODS: Whole blood DNAm profiles were obtained for a case-cohort sample of 
participants in the Sister Study and used to calculate 109 Protein EpiScores. Of 
the 4,479 women included, 2,151 (48%) were diagnosed with breast cancer within 
15 years of their baseline blood draw (median time to diagnosis: 8.6 years; 
1,673 invasive cancer and 478 ductal carcinomas in situ). Protein EpiScores 
associations with breast cancer incidence were estimated using weighted Cox 
regression models, overall and stratified by time and participant 
characteristics.
RESULTS: Protein EpiScores for RARRES2, IGFBP4, and CCL21 were positively 
associated with invasive breast cancer risk (hazard ratios from 1.17 to 1.24), 
while those for F7, SELL, CXCL9, CD48, and IL19 were inversely associated 
(hazard ratios from 0.82 to 0.86) (all FDR < 0.10). Eight immune 
response-related Protein EpiScores (CXCL9, CD48, FCGR3B, CXCL11, CCL21, CRTAM, 
VCAM1, GZMA) were associated with invasive cancers diagnosed within five years 
of enrollment. Protein EpiScore associations were consistently stronger for 
estrogen receptor-negative tumors.
CONCLUSIONS: Several Protein EpiScores, including many related to immune 
response, were associated with breast cancer risk, highlighting novel changes to 
the peripheral immune system that occur during breast cancer development.

The human Fallopian tube (FT) is an important organ in the female reproductive 
system and has been implicated as a site of origin for pelvic serous cancers, 
including high-grade serous tubo-ovarian carcinoma (HGSC). We have generated 
comprehensive whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, RNA-seq, and proteomic data of 
over 100 human FTs, with detailed clinical covariate annotations. Our results 
challenge existing paradigms that extensive epigenetic, transcriptomic and 
proteomic alterations exist in the FTs from women carrying heterozygous germline 
BRCA1/2 pathogenic variants. We find minimal differences between BRCA1/2 
carriers and non-carriers prior to loss of heterozygosity. Covariates such as 
age and surgical indication can confound BRCA1/2-related differences reported in 
the literature, mainly through their impact on cell composition. We 
systematically document and highlight the degree of variations across normal 
human FT, defining five groups capturing major cellular and molecular changes 
across various reproductive stages, pregnancy, and aging. We are able to 
associate gene, protein, and epigenetic changes with these and other clinical 
covariates, but not heterozygous BRCA1/2 mutation status. This sheds new light 
into prevention and early detection of tumorigenesis in populations at high-risk 
for ovarian cancer.

Scientific evidence demonstrates that a very low-calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) 
is effective and beneficial in the treatment of obesity, capable of reversing 
the methylome associated with obesity and has immunomodulatory capacity. This 
effect is in part promoted by nutritional ketosis and could be involved in 
counteracting obesity-related cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the 
effect of nutritional ketosis on the methylation of genes related to tumor 
processes in patients with obesity and in breast cancer cells. Based on 
methylome data (Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip, Illumina) from patients with 
obesity treated with a VLCKD for weight loss (n = 10; n = 5 women, 
age = 48.8 ± 9.20 years, BMI = 32.9 ± 1.4 kg/m2), genes belonging to 
cancer-related pathways were specifically evaluated and further validated in 
vitro in MDA-MB-231 (triple negative) and MCF7 (RE positive) breast tumor cells 
pretreated for 72 h with βOHB, the main ketone body, secretome from visceral 
(VATs) or subcutaneous (SATs) adipose tissue of patients with obesity. The cell 
tumoral phenotype was evaluated by proliferation assay and expression of 
cancer-related genes. VLCKD-induced nutritional ketosis promoted changes in the 
methylation of 18 genes (20 CpGs; 17 hypomethylated, 3 hypermethylated) belonged 
to cancer-related pathways with MAPK10, CCN1, CTNNA2, LAMC3 and GLI2 being the 
most representative genes. A similar pattern was observed in the MDA-MB-231 
cells treated with β-OHB, without changes in MCF7. These epigenetic changes 
paralleled the tumoral phenotype modulated by the treatments. Taking together 
these results highlight the potential role of VLCKD as an adjuvant to anticancer 
treatment in groups more susceptible to the development of cancer such as 
patients with obesity, exerting epigenetic regulation through nutritional 
ketosis and weight loss.

Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome (BWS) is an epigenetic overgrowth syndrome caused by 
methylation changes in the human 11p15 chromosomal locus. Patients with BWS may 
exhibit hepatomegaly, as well as an increased risk of hepatoblastoma. To 
understand the impact of these 11p15 changes in the liver, we performed a 
multiomic study [single nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) + single nucleus 
assay for transposable-accessible chromatin-sequencing (snATAC-seq)] of both 
BWS-liver and nonBWS-liver tumor-adjacent tissue. Our approach uncovers 
hepatocyte-specific enrichment of processes related to peroxisome 
proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARA). To confirm our findings, we 
differentiated a BWS induced pluripotent stem cell model into hepatocytes. Our 
data demonstrate the dysregulation of lipid metabolism in BWS-liver, which 
coincides with observed upregulation of PPARA during hepatocyte differentiation. 
BWS hepatocytes also exhibit decreased neutral lipids and increased fatty acid 
β-oxidation. We also observe increased reactive oxygen species byproducts in BWS 
hepatocytes, coinciding with increased oxidative DNA damage. This study proposes 
a putative mechanism for overgrowth and cancer predisposition in BWS liver due 
to perturbed metabolism.

Breast cancer is the most common neoplasm in women worldwide, with both genetic 
and environmental factors playing a role in its development. Glyphosate, the 
active ingredient in widely used agricultural herbicides, is recognized as a 
potential carcinogen and endocrine disruptor, making it a candidate for inducing 
epigenetic modifications linked to breast cancer. This study investigates the 
effects of the glyphosate-based herbicide Roundup® on non-tumorigenic (MCF10A) 
and tumorigenic (MCF7 and MDA-MB-231) breast cell lines, focusing on the 
expression of key breast cancer-related genes. Additionally, the study examines 
the association with epigenetic modifications and the use of epidrugs to reverse 
potential alterations, aiming to understand the risks and mechanisms of 
herbicide action. Results indicate that Roundup® affects cells through a 
non-estrogenic mechanism, impacting both hormone-dependent and -independent 
cells with varying toxic and proliferative effects depending on dose and 
exposure time. Moreover, it altered the expression of breast cancer-related 
genes such as BRCA1 and BRCA2 at low doses. The use of epigenetic modulators was 
able to reverse some Roundup®-induced changes, suggesting the herbicide's role 
in epigenetic modifications. Overall, these findings highlight the importance of 
understanding glyphosate-based herbicide mechanisms in humans, which could 
enable personalized prevention strategies to mitigate breast cancer risks.

Accurate cancer prognosis is essential for personalized clinical management, 
guiding treatment strategies and predicting patient survival. Conventional 
methods, which depend on the subjective evaluation of histopathological 
features, exhibit significant inter-observer variability and limited predictive 
power. To overcome these limitations, we developed cross-attention 
transformer-based multimodal fusion network (CATfusion), a deep learning 
framework that integrates multimodal histology-genomic data for comprehensive 
cancer survival prediction. By employing self-supervised learning strategy with 
TabAE for feature extraction and utilizing cross-attention mechanisms to fuse 
diverse data types, including mRNA-seq, miRNA-seq, copy number variation, DNA 
methylation variation, mutation data, and histopathological images. By 
successfully integrating this multi-tiered patient information, CATfusion has 
become an advanced survival prediction model to utilize the most diverse data 
types across various cancer types. CATfusion's architecture, which includes a 
bidirectional multimodal attention mechanism and self-attention block, is adept 
at synchronizing the learning and integration of representations from various 
modalities. CATfusion achieves superior predictive performance over traditional 
and unimodal models, as demonstrated by enhanced C-index and survival area under 
the curve scores. The model's high accuracy in stratifying patients into 
distinct risk groups is a boon for personalized medicine, enabling tailored 
treatment plans. Moreover, CATfusion's interpretability, enabled by 
attention-based visualization, offers insights into the biological underpinnings 
of cancer prognosis, underscoring its potential as a transformative tool in 
oncology.

INTRODUCTION: Infection with Epstein-Barr virus is a known risk factor for 
laryngeal carcinogenesis; it might influence DNA methylation acting as an 
epigenetic driver in this type of malignancy.
METHODS: Paired laryngeal tissues (neoplastic and peri-neoplastic) harvested 
from 24 patients were included in the study. Eleven patients expressing 
latent/lytic EBV genes were considered positive. 5-mC% was determined using 
ELISA technique and TSGs (PDLIM4, WIF1, DAPK1) promoters' methylation 
percentages were quantified by qMS-PCR. DNMTs (DNMT1 and DNMT3B) expression 
levels were quantified in qRT-PCR.
RESULTS: Overall, in laryngeal neoplastic samples vs peri-neoplastic ones, lower 
5mC% (p=0.004) and higher TSGs promoters hypermethylation were found (p<0.0001). 
Significant correlation between PDLIM4 and DAPK1 promoter methylation and 5-mC% 
(PDLIM4 p=0.0186; DAPK1 p=0.0259) was noted. Higher 5-mC% (p=0.0041), lower 
PDLIM4 gene promoter methylation (p=0.0017) and overexpression of DNMTs (DNMT1: 
p=0.0018, respectively DNMT3B: p=0.0017) were associated with EBV infection. 
Also, significant differences between EBV-positive and EBV-negative cases based 
on tumor stage (T) were noted for 5mC% in both T1/T2 (p=0.0364) and T3/T4 stages 
(p=0.0275), and for PDLIM4 promoter methylation in T1/T2 stages (p=0.0121).
CONCLUSION: Future studies are needed to more effectively illustrate the 
interplay between EBV infection and these epigenetic mechanisms. Notably, our 
study highlighted a correlation between EBV and epigenetic changes in laryngeal 
carcinoma.

METODE: Au fost incluse în studiu țesuturi laringiene pereche (neoplazice și 
peri-neoplazice) recoltate de la 24 pacienți. 11 pacienți la care s-a notat 
expresia genelor EBV litice/latente au fost considerați pozitivi. 5-mC% a fost 
determinat prin tehnica ELISA, iar procentele de metilare a promotorilor genelor 
tumoral-supresoare (PDLIM4, WIF1, DAPK1) au fost cuantificate prin qMS-PCR. 
Nivelurile de expresie ale DNMT1 și -3B au fost cuantificate prin qPCR.
REZULTATE: Per total, în probele laringiene neoplazice vs. peri-neoplazice s-a 
cuantificat un procent mai scăzut de 5-mC (p=0,004) și o hipermetilare a 
promotorilor genelor investigate (p<0,0001) Au fost obținute corelații 
semnificative între metilarea promotorilor genelor PDLIM4 și DAPK1 și 5-mC% 
(PDLIM4; p=0,0186; DAPK1; p=0,0259). Infecția cu EBV a fost asociată cu un 
procent ridicat de 5-mC (p=0,0026), o hipometilare a promotorului PDLIM4 
(p=0,0017) și hiperexpresia ADN metil-transferazelor (DNMT1; p=0,0018, respectiv 
DNMT3B; p=0,0017). Pe baza stadiului tumoral (T) au fost observate diferențe 
semnificative între cazurile EBV-pozitive și EBV-negative atât pentru 5-mC% în 
stadiile T1/T2 (p=0,0364) și stadiile T3/T4 (p=0,0275), cât și pentru metilarea 
promotorului PDLIM4 în stadiile T1/T2 (p=0,0121).
CONCLUZIE: Studii ulterioare vor ilustra mai bine interacțiunea dintre infecția 
cu EBV și acest mecanism epigenetic. Notabil, studiul nostru a evidențiat o 
corelație între infecția cu acest virus și modificările epigenetice în 
carcinomul laringian.

PURPOSE: Bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) inhibitors (BETi) have 
demonstrated epigenetic modulation capabilities, specifically in transcriptional 
repression of oncogenic pathways. Preclinical assays suggest that BETi 
potentially attenuates the PD1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint axis, supporting its 
combination with immunomodulatory agents.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A Phase 1b clinical trial was conducted to elucidate the 
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of the BET inhibitor RO6870810 as 
monotherapy and in combination with the PD-L1 antagonist atezolizumab in 
patients with advanced ovarian carcinomas and triple-negative breast cancer 
(TNBC). Endpoints included maximum tolerated dosages, adverse event profiling, 
pharmacokinetic evaluations, and antitumor activity. Pharmacodynamic and 
immunomodulatory effects were assessed in tumor tissue (by immunohistochemistry 
and RNA-seq) and in peripheral blood (by flow cytometry and cytokine analysis).
RESULTS: The study was terminated prematurely due to a pronounced incidence of 
immune-related adverse effects in patients receiving combination of RO6870810 
and atezolizumab. Antitumor activity was limited to 2 patients (5.6%) showing 
partial response. Although target engagement was confirmed by established BETi 
pharmacodynamic markers in both blood and tumor samples, BETi failed to markedly 
decrease tumor PD-L1 expression and had a suppressive effect on antitumor 
immunity. Immune effector activation in tumor tissue was solely observed with 
the atezolizumab combination, aligning with this checkpoint inhibitor's 
recognized biological effects.
CONCLUSIONS: The combination of BET inhibitor RO6870810 with the checkpoint 
inhibitor atezolizumab presents an unfavorable risk-benefit profile for ovarian 
cancer and TNBC (triple-negative breast cancer) patients due to the increased 
risk of augmented or exaggerated immune reactions, without evidence for 
synergistic antitumor effects.

BackgroundAcute myeloid leukemia (AML) prognosis varies greatly, underscoring 
the need for novel biomarkers to improve patient stratification. T-cell leukemia 
translocation-associated gene (TCTA) has emerged as a potential player in 
hematological malignancies, yet its role in AML remains unexplored.ObjectiveTo 
investigate the prognostic significance of TCTA in AML and elucidate its 
functional mechanisms.MethodsRNA sequencing data from 173 AML patients (TCGA) 
and 70 normal controls (GTEx) were analyzed. Patients were categorized into high 
and low TCTA expression groups. Bioinformatics tools assessed Gene Ontology, 
KEGG pathways, and immune infiltration and constructed a nomogram predicting 
1-5-year overall survival (OS).ResultsHigh TCTA expression correlated with 
significantly reduced OS (P < 0.001), with multivariate analysis identifying 
TCTA expression alongside age and cytogenetic risk as independent OS predictors. 
Receiver operating characteristic analysis validated TCTA's diagnostic 
potential. Enrichment analyses implicated TCTA in pathways critical to AML, such 
as hematopoiesis, p53 signaling, and DNA methylation, with a notable association 
with natural killer (NK) cell activity.ConclusionsElevated TCTA expression 
signifies poor prognosis in AML, positioning it as a promising prognostic 
biomarker. Its involvement in key AML-related pathways highlights TCTA's 
functional relevance and potential as a therapeutic target in AML management.

Epigenetic clocks have emerged as novel measures of biological aging and 
potential predictors of mortality. We examined all-cause, cardiovascular, and 
cancer mortality prediction by epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) estimated using 
different epigenetic clocks. Among 2105 participants to the 1999-2002 National 
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey aged ≥ 50 years old and followed for 
mortality through 2019, we calculated EAAs from the residuals of nine epigenetic 
clocks regressed on chronological age. We assessed the association of EAAs and 
pace of aging with mortality adjusting for covariates. During 17.5 years of 
median follow-up, 998 deaths occurred, including 272 from cardiovascular disease 
and 209 from cancer. Overall mortality was most significantly predicted by Grim 
EAA (P < 0.0001) followed by Hannum (P = 0.005), Pheno (P = 0.004), Horvath 
(P = 0.03), and Vidal-Bralo (P = 0.04) EAAs. Grim EAA predicted cardiovascular 
mortality (P < 0.0001), whereas Hannum (P = 0.006), Horvath (P = 0.009), and 
Grim (P = 0.01) EAAs predicted cancer mortality. Overall mortality prediction 
differed by race/ethnicity between non-Hispanic White and White participants for 
Horvath (Pinteraction = 0.048), Hannum (Pinteraction = 0.01), and Grim 
(Pinteraction = 0.04) EAAs. Hannum prediction of cancer mortality also differed 
between the two races/ethnicities (Pinteraction = 0.007). Despite being 
predictive in non-Hispanic White participants, Horvath (P = 0.75), Hannum 
(P = 0.84), and Grim (P = 0.10) EAAs failed to predict overall mortality in 
Hispanic participants, and Hannum EAA was not associated with cancer mortality 
in Hispanic participants (P = 0.18). In a US representative sample, Horvath, 
Hannum, SkinBlood, Pheno, Vidal-Bralo, and Grim EAAs as well as pace of aging 
predict mortality. Howbeit, Horvath, Hannum, and Grim EAAs were less predictive 
in Hispanic participants.

BACKGROUND: Lynch syndrome (LS) is an autosomal dominant cancer predisposition 
syndrome caused by a germline pathogenic variant, or epigenetic silencing, of a 
mismatch repair (MMR) gene, leading to a wide cancer spectrum with gene-specific 
penetrance. Ascertainment, assessment and testing of LS individuals is complex. 
A Canadian national guideline is needed to ensure equitable access to patient 
care across the country.
METHODS: The Canadian Lynch Syndrome (CDN-LS) working group was formed in 2021, 
consisting of 37 multidisciplinary LS experts and patient partners. To formulate 
consensus statements, a national environmental scan, Canadian clinical survey 
and literature review were undertaken. The e-Delphi method was used to reach 
consensus statements among the CDN-LS group.
RESULTS: The CDN-LS group voted on 21 statements, and 18 statements were adopted 
with over 80% agreement, including 16 statements that had over 90% agreement. 
These statements provide comprehensive guidelines on universal MMR reflex 
testing, cascade tumour testing (MLH1 promoter methylation, BRAF, somatic MMR), 
germline testing, therapeutics and patient advocacy.
CONCLUSION: This is the first comprehensive Canadian guideline for LS providing 
guidance to genetic specialists, laboratories, primary care providers and 
healthcare providers caring for patients with LS. It is endorsed by the Canadian 
College of Medical Genetics and the Canadian Association of Genetic Counsellors. 
The consensus statements are presented as a model for standard of care that 
improves equitable access to health services for LS across the country. Future 
work should include a national consensus on LS surveillance, with a goal to 
harmonise LS care across all provincial and territorial healthcare authorities.

Gallbladder stones alone do not explain the risk of gallbladder cancer (GBC) as 
the sole etiological factor. Chronic microbial infection, particularly 
Salmonella, has been implicated in GB carcinogenesis, but its causative role and 
the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. We studied gut and gallbladder 
tissue microbiome through targeted metagenomics to identify pathogenic bacteria 
in GBC. Virulence and pathogenicity of identified Salmonella Typhimurium from 
GBC tissue were studied after culture by whole genome sequencing, phylogenetic 
analysis, mutational profiling, and pangenome analysis. Mechanistic studies for 
GBC carcinogenesis were carried out in a mouse model of gallstones and chronic 
Salmonella infection, a cellular model using GBC (NOZ) cell lines, and a 
xenograft tumor model. We found an increased abundance of Salmonella in the gut 
microbiome of patients with GBC and culturable S. Typhimurium from the 
gallbladder cancer tissue. Comparative genomics of S. Typhimurium isolated from 
the GBC tissue showed a high invasive index. S. Typhimurium isolates harbored 
horizontally acquired virulence functions in their accessory genome. Chronic S. 
Typhimurium infection caused chronic inflammation, pre-malignant changes, and 
tumor-promoting mechanisms in the mouse model with gallbladder stones with 
activation of the epigenetic modulator KDM6B both in the mouse model and human 
GBC. Inhibition of KDM6B reduced engrafted tumor size in SCID mice. Of the 
differentially regulated genes in human GBC tissue, ADAMTSL5, CX3CR1, and SPSB4 
were also significantly dysregulated in NOZ cells infected with Salmonella. 
Chronic Salmonella infection contributes to gallbladder carcinogenesis through a 
host epigenetic mechanism involving KDM6B.

BACKGROUND: The ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase phosphorylates and 
activates several downstream targets that are essential for DNA damage repair, 
cell cycle inhibition and apoptosis. Germline biallelic inactivation of the ATM 
gene causes ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), and heterozygous pathogenic variant 
(PV) carriers are at increased risk of cancer, notably breast cancer. This study 
aimed to investigate whether DNA methylation profiling can be useful as a 
biomarker to identify tumors arising in ATM PV carriers, which may help for the 
management and optimal tailoring of therapies of these patients.
METHODS: Breast tumor enriched DNA was prepared from 2 A-T patients, 27 patients 
carrying an ATM PV, 6 patients carrying a variant of uncertain clinical 
significance and 484 noncarriers enrolled in epidemiological studies conducted 
in France and Australia to investigate genetic and nongenetic factors involved 
in breast cancer susceptibility. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis was 
performed using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation EPIC and 450K BeadChips. 
Correlation between promoter methylation and gene expression was assessed for 10 
tumors for which transcriptomic data were available.
RESULTS: We found that the ATM promoter was hypermethylated in 62% of tumors of 
heterozygous PV carriers compared to the mean methylation level of ATM promoter 
in tumors of noncarriers. Gene set enrichment analyses identified 47 biological 
pathways enriched in hypermethylated genes involved in neoplastic, 
neurodegenerative and metabolic-related pathways in tumor of PV carriers. Among 
the 327 differentially methylated promoters, promoters of ARHGAP40, SCGB3A1 
(HIN-1), and CYBRD1 (DCYTB) were hypermethylated and associated with a lower 
gene expression in these tumors. Moreover, using three different deep learning 
algorithms (logistic regression, random forest and XGBoost), we identified a set 
of 27 additional biomarkers predictive of ATM status, which could be used in the 
future to provide evidence for or against pathogenicity in ATM variant 
classification strategies.
CONCLUSIONS: We showed that breast tumors that arise in women who carry an ATM 
PV display a specific genome-wide DNA methylation profile. Specifically, the 
methylation pattern of 27 key gene promoters was predictive of ATM PV status of 
the women. These genes may also represent new medical prevention and therapeutic 
targets for these women.

Chronic exposure to arsenic can lead to various health issues, including cancer. 
Concerns have been mounting about the enhancement of arsenic toxicity through 
co-exposure to various prevalent lifestyle habits. Smokeless tobacco (SLT) 
products are commonly consumed in South Asian countries, where their use 
frequently co-occurs with exposure to arsenic from contaminated groundwater. To 
decipher the in vitro molecular and cellular responses to arsenic and/or 
smokeless tobacco, we performed temporal multi-omics analysis of the 
transcriptome and DNA methylome remodeling in exposed hTERT-immortalized human 
normal oral keratinocytes (NOK), as well as arsenic and/or smokeless tobacco 
genotoxicity and mutagenicity investigations in NOK cells and in human p53 
knock-in murine embryonic fibroblasts (Hupki MEF). RNAseq results from acute 
exposures of NOK cell to arsenic alone and in combination with smokeless tobacco 
extract revealed upregulation of genes with roles in cell cycle changes, 
apoptosis and inflammatory responses. This was in keeping with global DNA 
hypomethylation affecting genes involved in the same processes after chronic 
treatment. At the phenotypic level, we observed a dose-dependent decrease in NOK 
cell viability, induction of DNA damage, cell cycle changes and increased 
apoptosis, with the most pronounced effects observed under arsenic and SLT 
co-exposure conditions. Live-cell imaging experiments indicated that the DNA 
damage likely resulted from induction of apoptosis, an observation validated by 
a lack of exome-wide mutagenesis in response to chronic exposure to arsenic 
and/or smokeless tobacco. In sum, our integrative omics study provides novel 
insights into the acute and chronic responses to arsenic and smokeless tobacco 
(co-)exposure, with both types of responses converging on several key mechanisms 
associated with cancer hallmark processes. The resulting rich catalogue of 
molecular programs in oral cells regulated by arsenic and smokeless tobacco 
(co-)exposure may provide bases for future development of biomarkers for use in 
molecular cancer epidemiology studies of exposed populations at risk.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) stands as the second most prevalent cause of 
cancer-related mortality globally, while its incidence holds the third position 
among newly diagnosed cancer cases worldwide. Colorectal carcinogenesis is 
complicated, and the processes are triggered by the complex interaction of some 
genetic and environmental factors, including DNA methylation. Previous studies 
showed that RALYL is hypermethylated in CRC. We aimed to explore the role of 
RALYL in CRC involved in MNK2 alternative splicing in the present study.
METHODS: Bioinformatics analysis, detection in CRC samples, and experiments 
in vitro and in vivo combined with gene knockdown and overexpression were 
conducted. Cell proliferation and tumor growth assays were performed.
RESULTS: Results showed that hypermethylated RALYL is lowly expressed in CRC. 
Overexpression of RALYL suppresses cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth 
in vivo in CRC. MNK2 alternative splicing is essential for the tumor suppressive 
role of RALYL, along with RALYL regulating MNK2 alternative splicing via HNRNPC 
in CRC.
CONCLUSIONS: RALYL potentially exerts an inhibitory effect on CRC by engaging 
with HNRNPC to orchestrate the alternative splicing of MNK2. RALYL binds to 
HNRNPC to promote MNK2 splicing into MNK2a instead of MNK2b, consequently 
activating the p38 MAPK signaling pathway and inhibiting tumor proliferation in 
CRC. Our findings suggest that RALYL might suppress CRC through binding to 
HNRNPC to promote MNK2 splicing toward MNK2a, thereby activating the p38 MAPK 
signaling cascade.

BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer globally, with 
radiation therapy (RT) being a key treatment for clinically localized and 
locally advanced cases. Given high survival rates, addressing long-term side 
effects of RT is crucial for preserving quality-of-life. Radiogenomics, the 
study of genetic variations affecting response to radiation, has primarily 
focussed on genomic biomarkers, while DNA methylation studies offer insights 
into RT responses. Although most research has centred on tumours, no 
epigenome-wide association studies have explored peripheral blood biomarkers of 
RT-induced toxicities in prostate cancer patients. Identifying such biomarkers 
could reveal molecular mechanisms underlying RT response and enable personalized 
treatment.
METHODS: We analysed 105 prostate cancer patients (52 cases and 53 controls). 
Cases developed grade ≥ 2 genitourinary and/or gastrointestinal late toxicity 
after 12 months of starting RT, whereas controls did not. An epigenome-wide 
association study of post-RT toxicities was performed using the Illumina 
MethylationEPIC BeadChip, adjusting for age and cell type composition. We 
constructed two methylation risk scores-one using differentially methylated 
positions (MRSsites) and another using differentially methylated regions 
(MRSregions)-as well as a Support Vector Machine-based methylation signature 
(SVMsites). We evaluated RT effects on biological age and stochastic epigenetic 
mutations within established radiation response pathways. Gene Ontology and 
pathway enrichment analyses were also performed.
RESULTS: Pre-RT methylation analysis identified 56 differentially methylated 
positions (adjusted p-value ≤ 0.05), and 6 differentially methylated regions 
(p-value ≤ 0.05) associated with the genes NTM, ACAP1, IL1RL2, VOOP1, AKR1E2, 
and an intergenic region on chromosome 13 related to Short/Long Interspersed 
Nuclear Elements. Both Methylation Risk Scores (MRSsites AUC = 0.87; MRSregions 
AUC = 0.89) and the 8-CpG Support Vector Machine signature (SVMsites AUC = 0.98) 
exhibited strong discriminatory accuracy in classifying patients in the 
discovery cohort. Gene ontology analysis revealed significant enrichment 
(adjusted p-value ≤ 0.05) of genes involved in DNA repair, inflammatory 
response, tissue repair, and oxidative stress response pathways.
CONCLUSIONS: Epigenetic biomarkers show potential for predicting severe 
long-term adverse effects of RT in prostate cancer patients. The identified 
methylation patterns provide valuable insights into toxicity mechanisms and may 
aid personalized treatment strategies. However, validation in independent 
cohorts is essential to confirm their predictive value and clinical 
applicability.

IMPORTANCE: Up to 80% of survivors of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma 
(HNSCC) currently or previously smoked. Thus, tobacco use is a major modifiable 
risk factor for HNSCC, even in the era of human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated 
disease. However, how smoking underlies chromosomal and epigenetic changes that 
are associated with HNSCC outcomes remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To characterize genetic and molecular differences and associated 
biological pathways in patients with HNSCC based on smoking history.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study included 
patients with a confirmed diagnosis of HNSCC from the Cancer Genome Atlas via 
cBioPortal data independent of HPV status. Data were analyzed between April 2023 
and May 2024.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Smoking history was defined as individuals who 
smoked (currently or previously) compared with nonsmokers (never smoked). 
Genetic and molecular differences of interest were single nucleotide variation, 
copy number alteration, DNA methylation, and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression. 
Accounting for multiple testing, we reported the false discovery rate (FDR), 
with a statistically significant FDR of 0.05 or less. Potential functions and 
pathways were investigated using the Panther classification system, and the 
Fisher exact test was used for overrepresentation, using the Reactome pathway 
dataset as a guide. Associations between smoking-related genetic alterations and 
overall survival were analyzed using log-rank tests.
RESULTS: Of 511 participants, 135 (26.4%) were female, and the mean (SD) age was 
60.8 (11.9) years. People who smoked (389 [76.1%]) demonstrated significantly 
enriched copy number alterations on 9 genes located on chromosome 11q13 compared 
with nonsmokers (122 [23.9%]; FDR, 0.044-0.046). Two genes, FADD and CTTN, were 
significantly highly methylated in nonsmokers. Also, PPFIA1, FGF19, CCND1 and 
LTO1 were highly expressed in mRNA in those who smoked, while FADD mRNA 
expression was negatively correlated with FADD DNA methylation in nonsmokers 
(Pearson r = -0.53; 95% CI, -0.59 to -0.49) and those who smoked (Pearson 
r = -0.57; 95% CI, -0.63 to -0.51). People who smoked with altered FADD had 
higher risk of dying than those with FADD unaltered (hazard ratio, 1.40; 95% CI, 
1.004-1.96). Pathway analysis showed the significant genes were collectively 
associated with cellular processes and biological regulations, including 
olfactory signaling and the PI3K/AKT network.
CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: The results of this cohort study suggest that there 
may be patterned genetic and molecular differences in patients with HNSCC based 
on smoking history, especially genes located on chromosome 11q13. These genomic 
differences due to smoking make smoking a modifiable risk factor for HNSCC 
outcomes.

Background: Distant metastases (DM) are the leading cause of thyroid 
cancer-related death in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). 
Despite significant progress in understanding DNA methylation in DTC, the 
methylation landscape of metastatic primary tumors and DM remains unclear. Our 
primary objective was to investigate DNA methylation dynamics during DTC 
progression, with a secondary goal of assessing potential clinical implications. 
Materials and Methods: We conducted a multicenter retrospective study in 
patients with DTC who underwent surgery at five university hospitals. We 
profiled DNA methylation in a discovery series of 97 samples (15 normal tissues, 
30 non-metastatic [non-mDTC], and 35 metastatic [mDTC] primary DTC, and 17 
paired metastases [lymph nodes and DM]). Results were validated in an 
independent series of 17 non-mDTC and 13 mDTC. We used receiver operating 
characteristic curve analysis to evaluate the identified prognostic 
CpG-signature. Results: DNA methylation alterations, mostly hypomethylation, 
increased progressively from primary tumors to DM, both in papillary (PTC) and 
follicular (FTC) thyroid carcinomas. Compared with normal tissue, non-metastatic 
primary PTC (non-mPTC) exhibited more hypomethylated than hypermethylated CpGs 
in contrast to non-metastatic primary FTC (non-mFTC). However, metastatic 
tumors, both mPTC and mFTC, predominantly exhibited hypomethylated CpGs. The 
overlap of differentially methylated CpGs (DMe-CpGs) was low between non-mPTC 
and non-mFTC (14% non-mPTC DMe-CpGs present in non-mFTC) but significantly 
higher between mPTC and mFTC (60% mPTC DMe-CpGs present in mFTC), underscoring 
the convergence of epigenetic changes during metastatic progression. The 
presence of many de novo DMe-CpGs from metastatic primary tumors (83% from mPTC 
and 40% from mFTC) in DM, including metachronous DM, supports the hypothesis 
that DM originates from a major subclone of the primary tumor. We identified and 
validated a 156-CpG signature in primary tumors capable of distinguishing 
between non-mDTC and mDTC, offering potential prognostic value for DM 
development regardless of histology. Conclusions: These results show a 
progressive increase in DNA methylation alterations, mainly hypomethylation, 
during PTC and FTC metastatic progression, suggesting a linear model, though the 
DNA methylation dynamics differs between the two histological types. The 
analysis of the 156-CpG signature in primary tumors may help identify patients 
with DTC at high risk for DM, enhancing a more personalized treatment.

ER-positive/HER2-negative (ERpHER2n) breast cancer classified as PAM50 
HER2-enriched (ERpHER2n-HER2E) represents a small high-risk patient subgroup. In 
this study, we investigate genomic, transcriptomic, and clinical features of 
ERpHER2n-HER2E breast tumors using two primary ERpHER2n cohorts comprising a 
total of 5640 patients. We show that ERpHER2n-HER2E tumors exhibit aggressive 
clinical features and poorer clinical outcomes compared to Luminal A and Luminal 
B tumors. Furthermore, ERpHER2n-HER2E breast cancer does not consist of 
misclassified or HER2-low cases, has little impact of ERBB2, is highly 
proliferative and less ER dependent than other luminal subtypes. It is not an 
obvious biological entity but is nevertheless associated with potentially 
targetable molecular features, notably a high immune response and high FGFR4 
expression. Strikingly, molecular features that define the HER2E subtype in 
luminal disease are also consistent in HER2-positive disease, including an 
epigenetic mechanism for high FGFR4 expression in breast cancer.

Histones Classification Based on EGFET Signals.

Barahona J, Richardson H, Acosta L, Khatri G, Miller F, Pavlidis S, Lobaton E.

Dysregulation of histones has been implicated in several medical conditions, 
including various cancers and neurodegenerative disorders. Histone-specific 
biosensors are key in detecting and quantifying them, advancing our 
understanding of chromatin dynamics and epigenetic regulation for potential 
breakthroughs in cancer research and personalized medicine. The focus of this 
paper is on quantifying a biosensor's ability to distinguish between Human 
Histones (H4) and non-target analytes. Classification methods are used to 
provide complementary analysis to biosensor data derived from sensor 
manufactured using a KU7 RNA aptamer bonded to a gold electrode. The features 
found provide high classification performance (F1 score over 0.99) and suggest 
physical insights to the operation of the sensor not provided by typical 
analysis. Furthermore, machine learning techniques are used in an exploratory 
analysis to test the effects of faulty manufacturing or differences in testing 
environments on histone detection accuracy.

BACKGROUND: The function of GCNT2 has been documented to act as an oncogenic 
driver or tumor suppressor in different types of tumor, but the role of GCNT2 
and the epigenetic regulation mechanism in AML, however, has not yet been 
clarified. This study aimed to assay the expression and methylation profile of 
GCNT2 in AML, and further elucidate the clinical significance.
METHODS: Multiple datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer 
Genome Atlas projects (TCGA) were used to explore the expression and methylation 
profile of GCNT2 in normal hematopoiesis and AML. A pan-cancer analysis was 
performed to define the survival implications of GCNT2 across multiple cancers 
including AML. The relationships between GCNT2 expression/methylation and 
clinicopathologic features were investigated using a TCGA-AML dataset. 
Correlation analysis was performed to explore the relationship between 
transcriptional expression and DNA methylation. Differentially expressed genes 
(DEGs) on the KEGG pathway and GO terms were visualized using DAVID. Gene Set 
Enrichment Analysis (GESA) was carried out to assess the underlying mechanism. 
The relationship between methylation and immune cell infiltration was also 
examined.
RESULTS: GCNT2 expression was highest in hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) but 
gradually decreased during the hematopoiesis differentiation, the monocytes, 
however, remained a high level of GCNT2 as an exception. In AML, GCNT2 was 
down-regulated as compared to normal hematopoiesis but was much higher in 
contrast to normal peripheral blood samples. Data from a pan-cancer analysis 
revealed that high-expressed GCNT2 contributed to a worse OS for AML. DNA 
methylation of GCNT2 showed a distinctive co-methylation pattern in AML and 
significantly negatively correlated with transcriptional expression. Methylation 
in the transcriptional start site of isoform A plays a critical role in the 
epigenetic regulation of GCNT2 expression. The silence of GCNT2 in AML was 
attributed to DNA methylation. Hypomethylation of isoform A significantly 
predicted poor survival in AML, linking to several cytogenetic and molecular 
abnormalities, such as t (8:21), inv (16), t (15;17), and genes mutations of 
DNMT3A, CEBPA, RUNX1, and WT1. Enrichment analysis disclosed that 
hypomethylation of isoform A was involved in the immune system, and it was 
further revealed that hypomethylation of isoform A was tightly associated with 
immune cell infiltration and could be served as a promising indicator for 
immunotherapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Our comprehensive research demonstrated that GCNT2 acted as an 
oncogene in AML, and was epigenetically regulated by DNA methylation in isoform 
A. Hypomethylation of isoform A could be served as a promising indicator to 
identify the high-risk AML patients who might be responsive to immunotherapy.

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a crucial risk factor for both pancreatic cancer (PC) 
and kidney cancer (KC). However, effective common drugs for treating PC and/or 
KC patients who are also suffering from T2D are currently lacking, despite the 
probability of their co-occurrence. Taking disease-specific multiple drugs 
during the co-existence of multiple diseases may lead to adverse side effects or 
toxicity to the patients due to drug-drug interactions. This study aimed to 
identify T2D-, PC and KC-causing common genomic biomarkers (cGBs) highlighting 
their pathogenetic mechanisms to explore effective drugs as their common 
treatment. We analyzed transcriptomic profile datasets, applying weighted gene 
co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and protein-protein interaction (PPI) 
network analysis approaches to identify T2D-, PC-, and KC-causing cGBs. We then 
disclosed common pathogenetic mechanisms through gene ontology (GO) terms, KEGG 
pathways, regulatory networks, and DNA methylation of these cGBs. Initially, we 
identified 78 common differentially expressed genes (cDEGs) that could 
distinguish T2D, PC, and KC samples from controls based on their transcriptomic 
profiles. From these, six top-ranked cDEGs (TOP2A, BIRC5, RRM2, ALB, MUC1, and 
E2F7) were selected as cGBs and considered targets for exploring common drug 
molecules for each of three diseases. Functional enrichment analyses, including 
GO terms, KEGG pathways, and regulatory network analyses involving transcription 
factors (TFs) and microRNAs, along with DNA methylation and immune infiltration 
studies, revealed critical common molecular mechanisms linked to PC, KC, and 
T2D. Finally, we identified six top-ranked drug molecules (NVP.BHG712, 
Irinotecan, Olaparib, Imatinib, RG-4733, and Linsitinib) as potential common 
treatments for PC, KC and T2D during their co-existence, supported by the 
literature reviews. Thus, this bioinformatics study provides valuable insights 
and resources for developing a genome-guided common treatment strategy for PC 
and/or KC patients who are also suffering from T2D.

OBJECTIVE: The concept of ""lifestyle"" encompasses various factors, including 
nutrition, behavior, stress, physical activity, work habits, smoking, and 
alcohol consumption. Increasing evidence suggests that environmental and 
lifestyle factors can influence epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, 
histone acetylation, and microRNA expression. Given that microRNAs (miRNAs) are 
an emerging focus in cancer research, there is growing interest in understanding 
how lifestyle choices affect miRNA responses. MiR-21 is well-established as an 
oncogenic miRNA, while miR-125a is reported as a tumor-suppressive miRNA in 
different cancers. This study aimed to analyze whether cigarette smoking and 
alcohol consumption are associated with altered levels of these salivary miRNAs 
in healthy individuals.
METHODS: Saliva supernatant samples from 50 healthy individuals (10% smokers and 
34% alcohol drinkers) were analyzed alongside non-smokers and non-alcohol 
drinkers using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The expression levels 
of miR-21 and miR-125a were compared across samples based on demographic 
characteristics, social status, and smoking and drinking habits.
RESULT: The data showed overexpression of salivary miR-21 in individuals who 
regularly consumed alcohol and smoked, while miR-125a expression was not 
significantly affected in either group.
CONCLUSION: The differential expression of salivary miR-21 in healthy 
individuals from a localized population suggests a correlation with common 
lifestyle risk factors.

DNA methylation profiling by Illumina methylation array-based methods has 
revolutionized the molecular classification and diagnosis of brain tumors. A 
significant barrier to adopting these methods in a clinical environment is the 
requirement for specialized scanners, which results in high additional costs and 
a larger laboratory footprint. DNA sequencing-based alternatives are attractive 
because most clinical molecular pathology laboratories already use sequencers 
for other molecular assays. This study aimed to compare the utility of the newly 
developed sequencing-based enzymatic methyl sequencing (EM-seq) method paired 
with the Twist Human Methylome panel for brain tumor classification with 
standard Infinium Methylation BeadChip-based methods. We used DNA from 
fresh-frozen or formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) brain cancer samples 
from 19 patients and 1 control sample to construct DNA libraries covering 3.98 
million CpG sites. We developed and validated a bioinformatics pipeline to 
analyze target-enriched EM-seq (TEEM-seq) data in comparison with standard 
array-based methods for tumor classification and copy number profiling. We found 
high concordance between TEEM-seq and traditional methods, with high correlation 
coefficients (>0.98) between FFPE replicates. We successfully classified tumor 
samples into the expected molecular classes with robust prediction scores 
(>0.82). We observed that FFPE samples required a sequencing depth of at least 
35x to achieve consistently high and reliable prediction scores. The TEEM-seq 
method has the potential to complement existing tumor classification methods and 
lower the barriers for the adoption of methylation profiling in routine clinical 
use.

The correlation between air pollution and cancer incidence has been a 
longstanding concern, understanding the need to elucidate the specifics of this 
relationship. Thus, this study aimed to assess the association between exposure 
to air pollution and cancer incidence, and to identify the possible biological 
links between the two. We examined global cohort studies investigating the 
association between air pollution and cancer and performed a univariate 
Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. Our analysis revealed that the presence 
of particulate matter (PM)2.5, PM10, NO2, and NOx substantially impacted the 
risk of developing cancer. MR analysis identified 130 CpGs sites associated with 
three ambient air pollutants that have significant casual effects on the risk of 
14 cancer sites (false discovery rate<0.05). Gene annotation was conducted using 
g-Profiler by screening for single nucleotide polymorphisms significantly 
associated with outcome, followed by analysis of the gene interaction network 
using GeneMANIA, and visualization using igraph. In conclusion, this study 
demonstrates that air pollution has a significant impact on cancer incidence, 
provides strong evidence for an epigenetic causal link between the two, and 
provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms by which air pollution 
affects cancer development.

Prostate cancer (PC) is the most diagnosed cancer in males across the globe. 
Following the formation of metastasis, PC is linked to a notable decline in both 
prognosis and survival rates. Three-dimensional multicellular spheroids (MCSs) 
of a prostate adenocarcinoma cell line were generated in a three-day simulated 
microgravity environment (s-µg) to serve as a model for metastasis and to derive 
transcriptional and epigenetic PC candidates from molecular biological changes. 
With an FDR of 10-3, we detected the most differentially expressed genes in the 
two comparisons' adherent cells (AD) to MCSs (N = 751 genes) and 1g control 
cells to MCSs (N = 662 genes). In these two comparisons, genes related to cell 
cycle, angiogenesis, cell adhesion, and extracellular space were consistently 
found to be significantly enriched in GO annotations. Furthermore, at a 5% FDR 
significance level, we were able to identify 11,090 genome-wide differentially 
methylated positions (DMPs) and one differentially methylated region in the SRMS 
gene in the 1g vs. AD comparison, as well as an additional 10,797 DMPs in the 1g 
vs. MCSs comparison. Finally, we identified five s-µg-related positive 
enrichments of transcription factor binding sites for AR, IRF1, IRF2, STAT1, 
STAT2, and FOXJ3 close to the DMPs.

BACKGROUND: Discrepancies have been found between preoperative colposcopic 
biopsy results and histology results of loop electrical excision procedure 
(LEEP) specimens. GynTect® is a six-methylation-marker assay that has 
demonstrated its potential as a triage tool for cervical lesion detection and 
prediction. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of GynTect® 
in predicting the histology outcomes of post-LEEP specimens.
METHOD: A retrospective analysis was conducted to evaluate the clinical 
profiles, GynTect® results, and histology outcomes of postoperative specimens 
from 78 patients diagnosed with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion 
(HSIL) who underwent LEEP. The GynTect® assay is a six-marker (ASTN1, DLX1, 
ITGA4, RXFP3, SOX17, and ZNF671) methylation detection assay for cervical prep 
cell samples. Preoperative cervical cytology, high-risk human papillomavirus 
(hrHPV) detection, and methylation analysis were obtained from each participant. 
Preoperative colposcopic impression and biopsy results were recorded. 
Statistical analysis and multivariate logistic regression were performed using 
IBM SPSS Statistics 25.
RESULTS: Among the negative-GynTect® patients, 19 cases (57.6%) showed histology 
downgrading post-LEEP, while 14 cases (42.4%) showed sustained or upgrading 
histology results. In the positive-GynTect® patients, 8 cases (17.8%) showed 
downgrading histology results post-LEEP and 37 cases (82.2%) showed sustained or 
upgrading histology. The difference was statistically significant (p = 0.001). 
Multivariate regression analysis identified positive GynTect® outcomes and 
colposcopic impressions indicating HSIL on the day of surgery as independent 
predictors of pathological sustained or upgrading after LEEP.
CONCLUSIONS: This study underscores the potential of GynTect® in predicting 
histology outcomes of post-LEEP specimens, thereby showcasing its promising 
ability to assist clinicians in selecting appropriate therapeutic regimens for 
patients with HSIL.

BACKGROUNDCurrent methods for detecting esophageal cancer (EC) are generally 
invasive or exhibit limited sensitivity and specificity, especially for the 
identification of early-stage tumors.METHODSWe identified potential methylated 
DNA markers (MDMs) from multiple genomic regions in a discovery cohort, and a 
diagnostic model was developed and verified in a model-verification cohort of 
297 participants. The accuracy of the MDM panel was validated in a multicenter, 
prospective cohort (n = 1,429). The clinical performance of identified MDMs were 
compared with current tumor-associated protein markers.RESULTSFrom 31 
significant differentially methylated EC-associated regions identified in the 
marker discovery, we trained and validated a 3-MDM diagnostic model that could 
discriminate among patients with EC and volunteers without EC in a multicenter 
clinical prospective cohort with a sensitivity of 85.5% and a specificity of 
95.3%. This panel showed higher sensitivity in diagnosing early-stage tumors, 
with sensitivities of 56% for stage 0 and 77% for stage I, compared with the 
performance of current biochemical markers. In population with high risk for EC, 
the sensitivity and specificity were 85.68% and 93.61%, 
respectively.CONCLUSIONThe assessment of tumor-associated methylation status in 
blood samples can facilitate noninvasive and reliable diagnosis of early-stage 
EC, which warrants further development to expand screening and reduce mortality 
rates.TRIAL REGISTRATIONChiCTR2400083525.FUNDINGScience and technology funds of

Genome-wide human genetic studies have identified inherited cis-regulatory loci 
variants that predispose to cancers. However, the mechanisms by which these 
germline variants influence cancer progression, particularly through gene 
expression and proteostasis control, remain unclear. By analyzing genomic data 
from a gastric cancer (GC) case-control study (2,117 individuals), focusing on 
the ubiquitin-specific protease (USP) family, we identify the SNP rs72856331 
(G>A) in the promoter region of the proto-oncogene USP47 as a putative 
susceptibility allele for GC. Mechanistically, the risk allele G is associated 
with enhanced USP47 expression, mediated by altered recruitment of the 
transcription factor GLI3 and changes in the epigenetic status at promoter. 
CRISPR/Cas9-mediated single-nucleotide conversion into risk allele G results in 
increased GLI3 binding and subsequent USP47 upregulation. The depletion of GLI3 
results in a reduction of cancer-related phenotypes, similar to those observed 
following USP47 knockdown. Furthermore, we identify Snai1 as a deubiquitination 
target of USP47, explaining USP47-dependent activation of the 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition pathway and tumor progression. Our findings 
identify an important genetic predisposition that implicates the perturbation of 
transcription and proteostasis programs in GC, offering insights into prevention 
and therapeutic strategies for genetically stratified patients.

BACKGROUND/AIM: Methylation in the estrogen receptor alpha (ESRα) promoter is an 
epigenetic abnormality associated with breast cancer (BCa), whereas 
hypermethylation results in the loss of ER expression.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pyrosequencing was used to investigate a potential link 
between aberrant methylation in the P0/P1 promoters of ESRα and the risk of 
progression of benign fibrocystic and fibroadenoma tumors to BCa.
RESULTS: Results showed a significantly elevated level of DNA methylation in 
ESRα P1 promoter (p=0.0001) in fibroadenoma compared to ER-negative BCa tumors 
and a two-fold increased ESRα expression in fibrocystic and fibroadenoma benign 
tissues. In addition, methylation levels of HIN-1 and RASSF1A promoters were 
elevated in ER-positive compared to ER-negative BCa (p-value<0.04). ANOVA Mixed 
Model revealed significantly higher methylation levels in the promoter of 
RASSF1A for fibroadenoma and ER-positive BCa (p=0.004) compared to ER-negative 
BCa. Tumors with unclassified molecular subtypes (ER-positive, PR-negative, 
HER2-negative) had elevated levels of methylation (p=0.046) in the P0 promoter 
compared with luminal B (ER-positive, PR-positive, HER2-positive) tumors. Grade 
3 tumors showed a borderline association with ESRα P1 promoter methylation when 
compared with grade 2 tumors (p=0.056).
CONCLUSION: ESRα P0 promoter hypermethylation may occur in the early stages of 
breast carcinogenesis, while P1 promoter methylation appears in later stages 
with a poor prognosis. Therefore, methylation of the ESRα promoter and other 
tumor-related genes could serve as a potential biomarker for predicting 
fibroadenoma progression risk to BCa.

BACKGROUND/AIM: Oncogenic processes are delineated by metabolic dysregulation. 
Drug likeness is pharmacokinetically tested through the CYP450 enzymatic system, 
whose genetic aberrations under epigenetic stress could shift male organisms 
into prostate cancer pathways. Our objective was to predict the susceptibility 
to prostate neoplasia, focused on benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and 
prostate cancer (PCa), based on the pharmacoepigenetic and the metabolic profile 
of Caucasians.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two independent cohorts of 47,389 individuals in total 
were assessed to find risk associations of CYP450 genes with prostatic 
neoplasia. The metabolic profile of the first cohort was statistically evaluated 
and frequencies of absorption-distribution-metabolism-excretion-toxicity (ADMET) 
properties were calculated. Prediction of miRNA pharmacoepigenetic targeting was 
performed.
RESULTS: We found that prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia patients 
of the first cohort shared common cardiometabolic trends. Drug classes C08CA, 
C09AA, C09CA, C10AA, C10AX of the cardiovascular, and G04CA, G04CB of the 
genitourinary systems, were associated with increased prostate cancer risk, 
while C03CA and N06AB of the cardiovascular and nervous systems were associated 
with low-risk for PCa. CYP3A4*1B was the most related pharmacogenetic 
polymorphism associated with prostate cancer susceptibility. miRNA-200c-3p and 
miRNA-27b-3p seem to be associated with CYP3A4 targeting and prostate cancer 
predisposition. Metabolomic analysis indicated that 11β-OHT, 2β-OHT, 15β-OHT, 
2α-OHT and 6β-OHT had a high risk, and 16α-OHT, and 16β-OHT had an intermediate 
disease-risk.
CONCLUSION: These findings constitute a novel integrated signature for prostate 
cancer susceptibility. Further studies are required to assess their predictive 
value more fully.

IMPORTANCE: Inflammation impacts cancer risk and tumor biological processes, yet 
studies linking it to social and environmental risk factors are lacking.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of neighborhood deprivation and air 
pollution with breast adipose inflammation as well as the association between 
crown-like structures of the breast (CLS-B) and DNA methylation in Black and 
White women.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study analyzed women 
with and without breast cancer participating in the National Cancer 
Institute-Maryland Breast Cancer Study, most of whom were recruited between 
January 1, 1993, and December 1, 2003, from the University of Maryland Medical 
Center and surrounding hospitals in the Baltimore, Maryland, area. A small 
subset of the sample was recruited between March 27, 2012, and November 27, 
2017. Noncancerous breast tissue was collected from women who underwent 
reduction mammoplasty or breast cancer surgery. Statistical analyses were 
conducted between May and August 2024.
EXPOSURES: Two socioenvironmental exposures were examined: air pollution 
(specifically, fine particulate matter less than 2.5 μm in diameter [PM2.5]) and 
neighborhood deprivation (measured with Neighborhood Deprivation Index [NDI]). 
Participant geocodes were linked to 2000 US Census data to calculate PM2.5 
concentrations (total mass [μg/m3]) and NDI.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Breast tissues underwent immunohistochemical 
staining for pan-macrophage marker CD68 to detect 2 outcomes: CLS-B and 
adipose-associated macrophages. CLS-B and adipose-related macrophages were 
assessed by pathologists using artificial intelligence-assisted and manual 
approaches. Covariate-adjusted logistic regression models were used to ascertain 
associations between PM2.5 and NDI (exposures) and presence or absence of CLS-B 
(outcome); CD68-positive adipose macrophages were modeled as a dichotomous high 
or low variable. Covariate-adjusted linear regression was used to identify 
associations between CLS-B (exposure) and DNA methylation (outcome).
RESULTS: The cohort included 205 participants (127 Black [62.0%], 78 White 
[38.0%] women; mean [SD] age, 48.7 [13.3] years). Women with vs without CLS-B 
had higher median (IQR) body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms 
divided by height in meters squared; 35.5 [30.5-40.9] vs 31.8 [26.6-36.4]; 
P = .02). Higher levels of PM2.5 (odds ratio [OR], 2.32; 95% CI, 1.12-4.78; 
P = .02) and NDI (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.02-1.43; P = .03) were associated with 
presence of CLS-B overall; findings were still significant among Black women 
(PM2.5: OR, 2.64 [95% CI, 1.10-6.33], P = .03; NDI: OR, 1.22 [95% CI, 
1.01-1.48], P = .04) but were not statistically significant among White women 
(PM2.5: OR, 1.65 [95% CI, 0.45-5.99], P = .45; NDI: OR, 1.19 [95% CI, 
0.83-1.70], P = .35). Higher PM2.5 concentration was associated with increased 
macrophage infiltration (OR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.24-3.60; P = .006), with similar 
outcomes by race. The top 2 significant differentially methylated CpG sites by 
CLS-B status were SAR1B (β = 0.01; 95% CI, 0.01-0.02; P < .001) and IL2RB 
(β = -0.04; 95% CI, -0.05 to -0.02; P < .001). Significant interaction was 
observed between CLS-B status and race for IL2RB methylation levels (β = -0.03; 
95% CI, -0.04 to -0.01; P for interaction <.001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cross-sectional study uncovered an association 
between neighborhood-level social and environmental risk factors and breast 
tissue inflammation. The findings help inform efforts to reduce racial and 
socioeconomic disparities in breast cancer and improve health equity for 
socially vulnerable populations.

BACKGROUND & AIM: Osteopontin (OPN) was proposed to play a role in the 
pathophysiology of obesity and related disease, such as cancer. The aims were to 
evaluate the expression of OPN after caloric restriction-induced weight loss in 
adipose tissue (AT) from an animal model of diet-induced obesity (DIO) and to 
reflect these results on circulating OPN levels in patients with obesity (PWO); 
and to explore the effect of a very low-calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) on the 
circulating protein and DNA methylation levels of OPN, compared with a balanced 
hypocaloric diet (LCD) or bariatric surgery (BS) in PWO.
METHODS: OPN/SPP1 expression was evaluated in subcutaneous (SAT) and visceral 
(VAT) AT derived from diet-induced obesity (DIO) mice and after a 4-week 
weight-loss protocol of calorie restriction (CR). Plasmatic OPN was also 
evaluated in 32 normal-weight volunteers (20 women) and 79 PWO (59 women) and 
after a 4-6 months follow up of a VLCKD (n = 20), BS (n = 39) or LCD (n = 20). 
DNA methylation levels of OPN were extracted from our Infinium 
HumanMethylation450 BeadChips data sets.
RESULTS: OPN levels were higher in VAT of DIO mice and plasma of PWO than in 
normal-weight individuals and changed after weight loss. Particularly, 
circulating OPN increased 2 months after BS while it decreased at maximum 
ketosis-induced by VLCKD. A statistically significant decrease was also observed 
in methylation levels at cg11226901 after VLCKD.
CONCLUSIONS: OPN levels were reduced after VLCKD and severely increased after 
BS. Therefore, it could be a biomarker of the obesity-related metabolic stress 
and could be epigenetically regulated.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver diseases 
(MASLD), also known as non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD), have become a 
leading risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Western countries. 
NAFLD progresses from simple steatosis to HCC, with advanced liver fibrosis 
(ALF) and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) or 
non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) representing the two preceding high-risk 
stages.
METHODS: We analysed changes in the DNA methylation landscape from simple 
steatosis to ALF or NASH and determined their relevance in gene regulation and 
HCC survival. Methylomic datasets generated from applying the Illumina 450K 
BeadChip on human MASLD/NAFLD liver samples were analysed using integrative data 
analyses to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with 
ALF (F3/4 vs. F0/1) or non-fibrotic NASH (NASH-F0/1 vs. NAFLD-F0/1).
RESULTS: Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of genes associated with 
fibrosis-DMRs showed enrichment in xenobiotic metabolism, UV response and 
hypoxia pathways. Expression of 25 DMR-associated genes showed significant 
associations with HCC survival outcomes, including 16 genes with fibrosis-DMRs 
and 2 with NASH-DMRs mapped to their promoter regions. Binding motifs of seven 
transcription factors (TFs) were enriched in fibrosis-DMRs. Four DMR-associated 
genes (ESR1, TYW3, CLGN and TUBB) displayed an inverse relationship between 
promoter methylation and gene expression during human MASLD progression, which 
was further validated in a mouse MASLD model.
CONCLUSIONS: We propose a model in which changes in promoter DNA methylation 
during NAFLD progression regulate gene expression, impacting HCC survival 
outcomes.

Lung carcinogenesis is causally linked to cigarette smoking, in part by 
epigenetic changes. We tested whether accumulated epigenetic change in smokers 
is apparent in bronchial basal cells as cells of origin of squamous cell 
carcinoma. Using an EM-seq platform covering 53.8 million CpGs (96% of the 
entire genome) at an average of 7.5 sequencing reads per CpG site at a single 
base resolution, we evaluated cytology-normal basal cells bronchoscopically 
brushed from the in situ tobacco smoke-exposed 'bronchial epithelial field' and 
isolated by short-term primary culture from 54 human subjects. We found that 
mean methylation was globally lower in ever (former and current) smokers versus 
never smokers (p = 0.0013) across promoters, CpG shores, exons, introns, 
3'-UTRs, and intergenic regions, but not in CpG islands. Among 6mers with 
dinucleotides flanking CpG, those containing CGCG showed no effect from smoking, 
while those flanked with TT and AA displayed the strongest effects. At the gene 
level, smoking-related differences in methylation level were observed in CDKL1, 
ARTN, EDC3, CYP1B1, FAM131A, and MAGI2. Among candidate cancer genes, smoking 
reduced the methylation level in KRAS, ROS1, CDKN1A, CHRNB4, and CADM1. We 
conclude that smoking reduces long-term epigenome-wide methylation in bronchial 
stem cells, is impacted by the flanking sequence, and persists indefinitely 
beyond smoking cessation.

Plain Language Summary: In an epigenome-wide survey of normal bronchial cells 
brushed and primary-cultured from 54 donors, average cytosine methylation was 
globally lower and, equally so, in both former and current smokers versus never 
smokers across almost all genome compartments.At the gene level, smoking-related 
genome-wide significant differences in methylation level were observed in six 
agnostically uncovered, previously suspected carcinogenesis genes and another 
five genes among 40 a priori-selected candidate cancer genes.It is concluded 
that smoking reduces long-term epigenome-wide methylation in bronchial stem 
cells in cancer-related genes and persists indefinitely beyond smoking 
cessation, suggesting a possible decades-long epigenetic trace of risk for lung 
cancer and other lung disorders.

Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) and nicotine exposure have been implicated in lung cancer 
development. This study aims to elucidate the molecular mechanisms and potential 
biomarkers associated with this exposure in lung cancer patients. We integrated 
gene expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas lung cancer cohort and the 
Comparative Toxicogenomics Database to identify differentially expressed genes 
(DEGs) associated with BaP and nicotine exposure. Enrichment analyses, survival 
analyses, and immune cell infiltration analyses were conducted to interpret the 
biological significance of these DEGs. A risk score model and a nomogram were 
constructed for a prognostic evaluation. We identified 163 DEGs related to BaP 
and nicotine exposure in lung cancer. Enrichment analysis revealed significant 
biological processes and pathways, including ""IL-17 signaling"", ""cellular 
senescence"", and ""p53 signaling"". From the DEGs, 34 prognostic genes were 
identified, with CLDN5, DNASE1L3, and GPR37 being independent prognostic 
factors. A risk score model based on these genes showed significant prognostic 
value, with high-risk patients exhibiting poorer survival outcomes. 
Additionally, a nomogram based on these risk scores demonstrated good predictive 
accuracy and clinical utility. Kaplan-Meier analyses confirmed that high 
expression of CLDN5 and GPR37 correlated with poor survival, while high DNASE1L3 
expression indicated better survival. Single-gene enrichment analyses linked 
these genes to immune responses, cell adhesion, and DNA methylation. Immune cell 
infiltration analysis revealed significant correlations between the expression 
of these genes and the infiltration of various immune cell types. Our findings 
highlight the significant role of CLDN5, DNASE1L3, and GPR37 in lung cancer 
associated with BaP and nicotine exposure. The constructed risk score model and 
nomogram provide valuable tools for prognostication, and the identified genes 
offer potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Understanding the 
influence of toxic exposure on the tumor-immune microenvironment can guide 
future research and treatment strategies.

BRD1 encodes a protein containing a bromodomain, which is an essential component 
of histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complexes. These complexes play a crucial 
role in the regulation of gene transcription and the modification of chromatin 
structures. The aberrant expression of BRD1 is frequently observed across a 
range of cancer types, including hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). However, the 
precise mechanisms through which BRD1 contributes to tumorigenesis, especially 
in HCC, remain unclear. In our investigation, we have uncovered a novel role for 
BRD1 as an oncogene implicated the regulation of lipid metabolism in HCC 
progression. Specifically, the deficiency of BRD1 impedes the proliferation and 
metastasis of HCC cells reducing the accumulation of lipid droplets and 
cholesterol levels. This effect is mediated through the SREBF1-induced 
downregulation of SCD1 expression in HCC cells. Mechanistically, the ablation of 
BRD1 disrupts acetylation level of H3K9, culminating in the subsequent 
trimethylation of H3K9 (H3K9me3). Notably, the H3K14ac partially colocalizes 
with H3K9me3 and its methyltransferase SETDB1 to from a double labeling of both 
H3K14ac and H3K9me3 at the SREBF1 promoter. This double labeling contributes to 
the creation of a repressive environment, ultimately leading to the 
downregulation of SREBF1 gene expression in HCC. Furthermore, the combinatorial 
use of a BRD1 inhibitor and simvastatin augments antitumor efficacy in vivo. 
Collectively, our findings underscore BRD1 as a critical regulator of 
SREBF1-associated lipid metabolism and a participant in HCC progression through 
a distinct epigenetic regulatory mechanism. These discoveries further suggest a 
promising epigenetic therapeutic approach for the treatment of HCC.

Although inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colorectal polyps are considered 
as significant risk factors of colorectal cancer (CRC), the molecular mechanism 
associated with colorectal carcinogenesis is still explored. Unlike sporadic 
CRC, local persistent inflammation in IBD induces genetic and epigenetic 
alterations, leading to tumor development. Moreover, cumulative data indicate 
that colorectal polyps display a significant malignant potential. In this 
context, our study aimed to investigate the clinicopathological features of CRC 
associated with IBD and/or colorectal neoplastic polyps in a retrospective group 
of CRC cases. The clinical data and histopathological features of CRC cases have 
been collected from our files. Immunohistochemical examination of mismatch 
repair (MMR) proteins has been performed in a selected case. The study group 
comprised 40 patients, 72.5% men and 27.5% women, with a median age of 
64.73±9.09 years. Out of the cases with double association, 62.5% of CRC cases 
displayed colorectal polyps, while 32.5% of patients were diagnosed with both 
CRC and IBD, which encompassed both ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease 
(CD). Two patients included in our study group exhibited a triple association of 
IBD, colorectal polyps, and CRC, one of them showing defective MMR (dMMR) 
phenotype. Although our results provide significant data on the relationship 
between IBD, colorectal polyps, and colorectal carcinogenesis, future cohort 
studies are needed to improve our understanding on the complex mechanism of 
colorectal carcinogenesis, ultimately guiding improved prevention, diagnosis, 
and treatment strategies for these patients.

BRD4, a member of the BET family proteins, is extensively studied in cancer and 
is known for its complex network within tumor cells, interacting with various 
transcription factors and epigenetic regulatory proteins. However, the impact of 
BRD4 and its associated genes on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. 
HCC is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths globally, often 
diagnosed at an advanced stage, limiting treatment options. In this study, we 
curated BRD4-interacting genes and, through analysis of the TCGA-LIHC dataset, 
developed a four-gene prognostic model for HCC comprising EZH2, KIF20A, G6PD, 
and KIF2C. This model demonstrated strong predictive power in both training and 
validation cohorts, with high gene expression levels significantly correlating 
with poor prognosis. Furthermore, our analysis revealed significant 
immunological differences between risk groups and identified increased drug 
sensitivity in high-risk patients to certain medications, while decreased 
sensitivity to others. Experimental validation further indicated that the 
combination of BRD4 inhibitor ZBC260 and EZH2 inhibitor CPI-169 synergistically 
enhanced apoptosis in HCC. Collectively, this study provides a scientific 
rationale for early HCC diagnosis and personalized therapy, offering new 
insights into drug resistance in treatment.

Colorectal precancers in Lynch syndrome (LS) exhibit a distinct immune profile, 
presenting unique opportunities for developing immune-interception strategies to 
prevent carcinogenesis. Epigenetic modulation by EZH2 of immune-related genes is 
implicated in the carcinogenesis of different cancer types, including colorectal 
cancer. This study utilizes a mouse model of LS and ex vivo colonic organoids to 
assess the effects of the EZH2 inhibitor GSK503 on immune regulatory pathways, 
tumorigenesis, and epigenetic reprogramming. Our findings revealed that GSK503 
significantly increased CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in both splenocytes and colonic 
mucosa of treated mice compared with controls. Additionally, a preventive dose 
of GSK503 over 9 weeks notably reduced adenoma multiplicity, demonstrating its 
efficacy as a preventive modality. Single-cell RNA-Seq and molecular analyses 
showed activation of immune and apoptotic markers, along with a reduction in 
H3K27 methylation levels in colonic crypts. ChIP sequencing further revealed 
decreased levels of H3K27me3 and H3K4me1, while levels of the active enhancer 
marks H3K4me3 and H3K27Ac increased in treated mice. Collectively, these 
findings indicate that EZH2 inhibition enhances immune responses through 
epigenetic reprogramming in the genome of LS mice, establishing a promising 
framework for the clinical development of EZH2 inhibitors as a cancer prevention 
strategy for LS carriers.

Cigarette smoke (CS) is a driver of many respiratory diseases, including chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). 
Tobacco causes oxidative stress, impaired phagocytosis of alveolar macrophages 
(AMs), and alterations in gene expression in the lungs of smokers. MicroRNAs 
(miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that influence several regulatory pathways. 
Previously, we monitored the expressions of hsa-miR-223-5p, 16-5p, 20a-5p, 
-17-5p, 34a-5p, and 106a-5p in AMs derived from the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) 
of subjects with NSCLC, COPD, and smoker and non-smoker control groups. Here, we 
investigated the capability of CS conditionate media to modulate the 
abovementioned miRNAs in primary AMs obtained in the same 43 sex-matched 
subjects. The expressions of has-miR-34a-5p, 17-5p, 16-5p, 106a-5p, 223-5p, and 
20a-5p were assessed before and after in vitro CS exposure by RT-PCR. In 
addition, a comprehensive bioinformatic analysis of miRNAs KEGGS and PPI linked 
to inflammation was performed. Distinct and common miRNA expression profiles 
were identified in response to CS, suggesting their possible role in 
smoking-related diseases. It is worth noting that, following exposure to CS, the 
expression levels of hsa-miR-34a-5p and 17-5p in both smokers and non-smokers, 
106a-5p in non-smokers, and 20a-5p in smokers, shifted towards those found in 
individuals with COPD, suggesting them as a risk factor in developing this lung 
condition. Moreover, CS-focused sub-analysis identified miRNA which exhibited 
CS-dependent pattern and modulated mRNA involved in the immune system or AMs 
property regulation. In conclusion, our study uncovered miRNA signatures in AMs 
exposed to CS, indicating that CS might modify epigenetic patterns that 
contribute to macrophage activation and lung disease onset and progression.

Breast cancer (BC) is a widespread malignancy that affects the lives of millions 
of women each year, and its resulting financial and healthcare hardships cannot 
be overstated. These issues, in combination with side effects and obstacles 
associated with the current standard of care, generate considerable interest in 
new potential targets for treatment as well as means for BC prevention. One 
potential preventive compound is Withaferin A (WFA), a traditional medicinal 
compound found in winter cherries. WFA has shown promise as an anticancer agent 
and is thought to act primarily through its effects on the epigenome, including, 
in particular, the methylome. However, the relative importance of specific 
genes' methylation states to WFA function remains unclear. To address this, we 
utilized human BC cell lines in combination with CRISPR-dCas9 fused to DNA 
methylation modifiers (i.e., epigenetic editors) to elucidate the importance of 
specific genes' promoter methylation states to WFA function and cancer cell 
viability. We found that targeted demethylation of promoters of the tumor 
suppressors p21 and p53 within MDA-MB-231/MCF7 cells resulted in around 
1.7×/1.5× and 1.2×/1.3× increases in expression, respectively. Targeted 
methylation of the promoter of the oncogene CCND1 within MDA-MB-231/MCF7 cells 
resulted in 0.5×/0.8× decreases in gene expression. These changes to p21, p53, 
and CCND1 were also associated with decreases in cell viability of around 
25%/50%, 5%/35%, and 12%/16%, respectively, for MDA-MB-231/MCF7 cells. When 
given in combination with WFA in both p53 mutant and wild type cells, we 
discovered that targeted methylation of the p21 promoter was able to modulate 
the anticancer effects of WFA, while targeted methylation or demethylation of 
the promoters of p53 and CCND1 had no significant effect on viability decreases 
from WFA treatment. Taken together, these results indicate that p21, p53, and 
CCND1 may be important targets for future in vivo studies that may lead to 
epigenetic editing therapies and that WFA may have utility in the prevention of 
BC through its effect on p21 promoter methylation independent of p53 function.

Benzene, a well-known carcinogenic airborne pollutant, poses significant health 
risks, particularly in industries such as petroleum, shoemaking, and painting. 
Despite strict regulations, chronic occupational exposure persists, contributing 
to the onset of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and other malignancies. Benzene's 
carcinogenicity stems from its metabolic activation, leading to increased 
oxidative stress, DNA damage, and cancer transformation. While its toxicity is 
well-documented, the link between genetic and epigenetic alterations and cancer 
susceptibility in exposed workers remains underexplored. This study aims to 
identify early biomarkers of benzene exposure and AML risk by analyzing gene 
expression and DNA methylation datasets from GEO DataSets, integrated with 
molecular pathway analyses, as well as miRNA-target and protein-protein network 
evaluations. This multi-approach led to the identification of nine deregulated 
genes (CRK, CXCR6, GSPT1, KPNA1, MECP2, MELTF, NFKB1, TBC1D7, ZNF331) in workers 
exposed to benzene, with NFKB1 showing strong discriminatory potential. Also, 
dose-dependent DNA methylation changes were observed in CXCR6 and MELTF, while 
selected miRNAs such as let-7d-5p, miR-126-3p, and miR-361-5p emerged as key 
post-transcriptional regulators. Furthermore, functional enrichment linked these 
genes to immune response, inflammation, cell proliferation, and apoptosis 
pathways. While network analyses highlighted NFKB1, CRK, and CXCR6 as central to 
benzene-associated leukemogenesis. Altogether, these findings provide novel 
insights into an early biomarker fingerprint for benzene exposure and AML 
susceptibility, supporting the future development of biomolecular-based targeted 
occupational health monitoring and personalized preventive strategies for 
at-risk workers.

Human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated high-grade vulvar intraepithelial lesion 
(HSIL) is a precursor of vulvar squamous cell carcinoma (VSCC). Because of the 
8% cancer risk, many vulvar HSIL patients undergo aggressive and mutilating 
treatments. Characterizing HSIL by their progression risk can help individualize 
treatment strategies. Accordingly, copy number alterations (CNAs) and DNA 
methylation have been identified as biomarkers for cancer risk stratification of 
HSIL. Here, we assessed their potential correlation, and relation to HPV16 
(sub)lineages and progression to vulvar cancer. Eighty-two vulvar formalin-fixed 
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples, including controls, HSIL, HSIL adjacent to 
VSCC and VSCC, with previously determined DNA methylation profiles, were 
analysed for CNAs using mFAST-SeqS. Genome-wide z-scores were calculated to 
determine overall aneuploidy (aneuploidy scores), and compared to the 
methylation levels and status of marker panel ZNF582/SST/miR124-2. For 52 
HPV16-positive cases, HPV (sub)lineages were determined by Sanger sequencing. 
HPV16 lineage A was predominant (86.4%), followed equally by lineages B, C, and 
D. Frequent chromosomal alterations included chr1pq, chr3q, chr9q gains, and 
chr2q, chr4q losses. Median aneuploidy scores increased across disease 
categories, from 0 in controls, to 3 in HSIL, 16 in HSIL adjacent to VSCC and 29 
in VSCC. A positive relationship between aneuploidy scores and DNA methylation 
levels was found (ρ = 0.61, Spearman's rank correlation test). Aneuploidy scores 
were significantly higher in methylation-positive samples (p < .001). In 
conclusion, we showed that DNA methylation and CNAs both rise with increasing 
severity of disease, indicating their prognostic value for cancer risk 
stratification of HSIL, while no relation to HPV16 (sub)lineages was found.

INTRODUCTION: Barrett esophagus (BE) is the strongest known risk factor for 
developing esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), the second-most lethal cancer in the 
United States. Esopredict is a novel validated methylation-based biomarker assay 
that provides precise quantification of neoplastic progression risk in BE 
patients. Inherit challenges, including tissue heterogeneity, sampling error, 
interobserver variability, and inconsistent adherence to surveillance biopsy 
guidelines, may affect the predictive value results of Esopredict obtained at 
different anatomic locations or different sampling time points.
METHODS: To investigate the spatiotemporal performance of Esopredict across 
multiple spatiotemporal sampling points, we profiled 220 biopsies obtained from 
58 BE patients, including 11 patients with overlapping spatial and temporal 
biopsies. We focused on spatial profiling (i.e., multiple biopsies obtained at 
several anatomic locations during a single endoscopy) and temporal profiling 
(i.e., biopsies obtained from multiple endoscopies performed at different time 
points). Each patient had an initial histologic diagnosis of nondysplastic 
Barrett esophagus, indefinite for dysplasia, or low-grade dysplasia. Final 
follow-up (endpoint) biopsies showed either high-grade dysplasia or EAC 
(progressors), or nondysplastic Barrett esophagus, indefinite for dysplasia, or 
low-grade dysplasia (nonprogressors). Biopsies were analyzed with Esopredict to 
compute a progression risk score, which quantified the likelihood of future 
progression to high-grade dysplasia or EAC within 5 years.
RESULTS: In 52 spatially profiled patients, Esopredict demonstrated a 
sensitivity of 81% (17/21 progressor patients), based on the highest-scoring 
biopsy from each patient; sensitivity increased to 100% (12/12) when end point 
biopsies occurred within 5 years of the index (initial) biopsy. In 28 temporally 
profiled patients, sensitivity was 100% (8/8 patients), based on the biopsy 
performed at the time point closest to the end point biopsy.
DISCUSSION: Esopredict showed high predictive performance in multiple 
spatiotemporal samples in BE patients. These data further support the use of 
Esopredict as a robust test to distinguish high-risk BE patients, who may 
benefit from endoscopic eradication therapy or increased surveillance frequency, 
from low-risk patients, who may be candidates for less frequent surveillance and 
noninterventional observation.

Precise modulation of dynamic and complex tumor microenvironment (TME) to 
disrupt tumorigenesis and reshape intratumoral immune infiltration has emerged 
as promising approaches for enhanced cancer therapy. Among recent innovations, 
proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) represent a burgeoning chemical 
knockdown technology capable of degrading oncogenic protein homeostasis and 
inducing dynamic alternations within carcinoma settings, offering potential for 
antitumor manipulation. However, achieving selectivity in PROTACs that respond 
to disease environmental stimulation and precisely perturb on-target proteins 
remains challenging. The multi-step synthesis and limited permeability, 
attributed to high-molecular-weight and heterobifunctional structures, further 
hinder their in vivo efficacy. Herein, we present a unique TME-responsive 
enzyme-activated clickable PROTACs, which features a short peptide-tagged 
pomalidomide derivative to undergo tumor-specific cleavage by cathepsin protease 
to induce orthogonal crosslinking of the exposed cysteine with 
2-cyanobenzothiazole-labeled epigenetic protein-ligand JQ1, facilitating in situ 
degrader formation within tumor regions only. Systematic protein profiling and 
proteomic analysis revealed that such TME-specific clickable-PROTACs not only 
selectively eliminate epigenetic proteins without tedious pre-synthesis to 
bridge disparate small-molecule bi-warhead fragments, but also demonstrated 
superior tumor penetration compared to conventional high-molecular-weight 
PROTACs. Importantly, these clickable-PROTACs efficiently downregulated immune 
checkpoint programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) both in vitro and in vivo, 
remodeling TME for enhanced therapeutics, especially in anti-tumoral 
immunomodulation.

BACKGROUND: Ovarian cancer (OC) is a prevalent malignant tumor in the field of 
gynecology, exhibiting the third highest incidence rate and the highest 
mortality rate among gynecological tumors. Chromatin remodeling accomplishes 
specific chromatin condensation at distinct genomic loci and plays an essential 
role in epigenetic regulation associated with various processes related to 
cancer development.
METHODS: Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between OC and control samples 
were screened from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Genotype-Tissue Expression 
(GTEx) databases, combined with chromatin remodeling-related genes (CRRGs) 
obtained from the GeneCards database to identify differentially expressed CRRGs 
(DECRRGs). Enrichment analysis and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network 
were performed on the DECRRGs. Prognostic genes of OC were screened using 
univariate Cox and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) 
analyses. A risk model based on prognostic genes was developed, and the survival 
probability of OC patients in different risk groups was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier 
(KM) curve. Finally, the expression levels of prognostic genes were validated by 
quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blotting.
RESULTS: In total, 7 potential prognostic genes associated with the progression 
of OC patients were obtained, including ARID1B, ATRX, CHRAC1, HDAC1, INO80, 
MBD2, and SS18. Based on the expression level of prognostic genes, OC patients 
were divided into high-risk group and low-risk group. Survival analysis 
indicated that patients classified into the high-risk group had higher mortality 
rates, which enables this prediction model to be utilized as an independent 
predictor of OC. Immunocorrelation analysis showed that low-risk patients were 
more likely to benefit from immunotherapy.
CONCLUSION: In this study, we have identified 7 prognostic genes, including 
ARID1B, ATRX, CHRAC1, HDAC1, INO80, MBD2, and SS18. Overall, our findings 
provided a foundation for further comprehension of the potential molecular 
mechanisms underlying OC pathogenesis and progression.

Epimutation is defined as any heritable change in gene activity that does not 
affect the actual sequence of DNA. One of the most researched epimutations is 
promoter methylation of breast cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1. This 
epimutation may arise de novo in somatic tissues, such as breast or ovarian 
cancer tissue, but has also been shown to be widely distributed throughout 
tissues. BRCA1 methylation detectable in peripheral blood has been associated 
with the risk of both breast and ovarian cancer in patients without a germline 
pathogenic variant status of this gene. The strength of this association 
suggests that diagnostic screening for the BRCA1 epimutation should be 
considered with potential implications in cancer risk assessment. However, the 
detection of BRCA1 epimutation may be challenging, as it is generally detectable 
at a very low level in blood. Methylation-sensitive high-resolution melting 
(MS-HRM) was shown to provide a high sensitivity of methylation detection, and 
as it is a PCR-based method, epimutation screening based on MS-HRM is labor- and 
cost-effective. Here we describe the MS-HRM protocol for BRCA1 epimutation 
screening. © 2025 Wiley Periodicals LLC. Basic Protocol: High sensitivity

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous cancer, making outcomes 
prediction challenging. Several predictive and prognostic models are used but 
have considerable inaccuracy at individual level. We tried to increase 
prediction accuracy using a multi-omics strategy. We interrogated data from 1391 
consecutive, newly diagnosed subjects with AML, integrating information on 
mutation topography, DNA methylation, and transcriptomics. We developed an 
unsupervised multi-omics classification system (UAMOCS) with these data. UAMOCS 
provides a multidimensional understanding of AML heterogeneity and stratifies 
subjects into three cohorts: (a) UAMOCS1 [high lymphocyte activating 3 (LAG3) 
expression, chromosome instability, myelodysplasia-related mutations]; (b) 
UAMOCS2 (monocytic-like profile, immune suppression and activated angiogenesis 
and hypoxia pathways); and (c) UAMOCS3 [CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha 
(CEBPA) mutations and MYC pathway activation]. UAMOCS distinguishes overall 
survival rates across the cohorts (TCGA P = 0.042; GSE71014 P = 0.043; 
ihCAMs-AML, GSE102691 and GSE37642 all P < 0.001). The model's C-statistic is 
comparable to the 2022 ELN risk classification (0.87 vs 0.82; P = 0.162), but 
offers a more nuanced distinction between intermediate- and high-risk groups. 
When combined with high-throughput drug sensitivity testing, UAMOCS can 
accurately predict sensitivity to azacitidine (AZA) and venetoclax. The UAMOCS 
system is available as an R package. The UAMOCS system has the potential to 
redefine AML subtypes, enhance prognostic predictions, and guide treatment 
strategies based on patients' immune status and expected responses to therapies.

BACKGROUND: The advent of immunotherapy has revolutionized the treatment 
paradigm for gastric cancer (GC), offering unprecedented clinical benefits. 
However, a detailed molecular characterization of the tumor immune 
microenvironment in GC is essential to further optimize these therapies and 
enhance their efficacy.
METHODS: Consensus clustering was utilized to classify GC patients into distinct 
immune states, followed by an in-depth analysis of differences in mutation 
profiles, copy number variations, and DNA methylation patterns. Weighted gene 
co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and correlation analysis were applied to 
identify gene modules underlying the classification of immune ""hot"" and ""cold"" 
tumors. Subsequently, 101 machine learning algorithm combinations were employed 
to construct a prognostic model based on the identified gene modules. 
Single-cell analysis was conducted to investigate cellular interactions 
associated with the immune-determinant gene module. Finally, immunofluorescence 
staining for CD8, CD45, and CXCR4 was performed on human GC tissue samples.
RESULTS: A total of 1,298 GC patients were included in this comprehensive 
analysis. For the first time, we identified and characterized immune ""hot"" and 
""cold"" tumors in GC patients, revealing distinct molecular features associated 
with these tumor types. Immune ""hot"" tumor-related genes were identified, and 
their functional roles were validated through biological behavior analysis. A 
prognostic signature, termed the hot tumor top regulators (HTTR), was developed 
using 101 machine learning algorithm combinations. The HTTR signature emerged as 
an independent prognostic factor, effectively stratifying patients into low- and 
high-risk groups with significant differences in overall survival. High-risk 
groups demonstrated strong associations with immune checkpoint regulation, 
antigen presentation, and inhibitory pathways. Notably, single-cell analysis 
revealed that HTTR genes were highly active in CD8 + T cells, with the 
CXCL12-CXCR4 axis playing a critical role in mediating interactions between 
CD8 + T cells and endothelial cells.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the HTTR signature served as a robust prognostic 
biomarker for GC patients and effectively identified those with immune ""hot"" 
tumors. This finding provided valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms of 
tumor immunity in GC, offering potential avenues for targeted therapeutic 
interventions.

Current research on the relationship between environmental endocrine disrupting 
chemicals (EDCs) and breast cancer remains insufficient, with limited evidence 
and inconsistent conclusions. Mendelian randomization (MR) is a robust method 
for establishing causality, as it reduces biases from confounding factors and 
reverse causation. This study uses MR to investigate the effects of three types 
of EDCs, including bisphenols, parabens, and phthalates, on the risk of overall 
breast cancer and its subtypes-Luminal A, Luminal B, triple negative, human 
epidermal growth factor receptor 2-enriched, and estrogen 
receptor-positive/negative. The study also examines the 1400 blood metabolome as 
potential mediators and explores EDCs-associated DNA methylation changes as 
potential factors, with a focus on European populations. Our results shows that 
n-butyl paraben (n-BuP) is positively associated with Luminal A, mono-methyl 
phthalate is negatively associated with Luminal B, and mono-iso-butyl phthalate 
(MiBP) is positively associated with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). 
Mediation analysis reveals that blood metabolites, such as caffeic acid sulfate 
and the caffeine-to-paraxanthine ratio, mediate the effect of n-BuP on Luminal 
A, while methylsuccinate mediate the effect of MiBP on TNBC. Epigenetic analysis 
shows associations between EDCs exposure-related DNA methylation changes at 
specific CpG sites (cg26325335, cg08537847, cg27454300) and different breast 
cancer risks. These findings not only suggest potential biomarkers for early 
detection and intervention but also underscore the imperative for further 
research to rigorously validate these associations.

BACKGROUND: Cancer creates an immunosuppressive environment that hampers immune 
responses, allowing tumors to grow and resist therapy. One way the immune system 
fights back is by inducing ferroptosis, a type of cell death, in tumor cells 
through CD8 + T cells. This involves lipid peroxidation and enzymes like 
lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3 (Lpcat3), which makes cells more prone 
to ferroptosis. However, the mechanisms by which cancer cells avoid 
immunotherapy-mediated ferroptosis are unclear. Our study reveals how cancer 
cells evade ferroptosis and anti-tumor immunity through the upregulation of 
fatty acid-binding protein 7 (Fabp7).
METHODS: To explore how cancer cells resist immune cell-mediated ferroptosis, we 
used a comprehensive range of techniques. We worked with cell lines including 
PD1-sensitive, PD1-resistant, B16F10, and QPP7 glioblastoma cells, and conducted 
in vivo studies in syngeneic 129 Sv/Ev, C57BL/6, and conditional knockout mice 
with Rora deletion specifically in CD8+ T cells, Cd8 cre;Rorafl mice. Methods 
included mass spectrometry-based lipidomics, targeted lipidomics, Oil Red O 
staining, Seahorse analysis, quantitative PCR, immunohistochemistry, PPARγ 
transcription factor assays, ChIP-seq, untargeted lipidomic analysis, ROS assay, 
ex vivo co-culture of CD8+ T cells with cancer cells, ATAC-seq, RNA-seq, Western 
blotting, co-immunoprecipitation assay, flow cytometry and Imaging Mass 
Cytometry.
RESULTS: PD1-resistant tumors upregulate Fabp7, driving protective metabolic 
changes that shield cells from ferroptosis and evade anti-tumor immunity. Fabp7 
decreases the transcription of ferroptosis-inducing genes like Lpcat3 and 
increases the transcription of ferroptosis-protective genes such as Bmal1 
through epigenetic reprogramming. Lipidomic profiling revealed that Fabp7 
increases triglycerides and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), which impede 
lipid peroxidation and ROS generation. Fabp7 also improves mitochondrial 
function and fatty acid oxidation (FAO), enhancing cancer cell survival. 
Furthermore, cancer cells increase Fabp7 expression in CD8+ T cells, disrupting 
circadian clock gene expression and triggering apoptosis through p53 
stabilization. Clinical trial data revealed that higher FABP7 expression 
correlates with poorer overall survival and progression-free survival in 
patients undergoing immunotherapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study uncovers a novel mechanism by which cancer cells evade 
immune-mediated ferroptosis through Fabp7 upregulation. This protein reprograms 
lipid metabolism and disrupts circadian regulation in immune cells, promoting 
tumor survival and resistance to immunotherapy. Targeting Fabp7 could enhance 
immunotherapy effectiveness by re-sensitizing resistant tumors to ferroptosis.

Cervical cancer, the fourth most common cancer globally and the second most 
prevalent cancer among women in India, is primarily caused by Human Papilloma 
Virus (HPV). The association of diet with cancer etiology and prevention has 
been well established and nutrition has been shown to regulate cancer through 
modulation of epigenetic markers. Dietary fatty acids, especially omega-3, 
reduce the risk of cancer by preventing or reversing the progression through a 
variety of cellular targets, including epigenetic regulation. In this work, we 
have evaluated the potential of ALA (α linolenic acid), an ω-3 fatty acid, to 
regulate cervical cancer through epigenetic mechanisms. The effect of ALA was 
evaluated on the regulation of histone deacetylases1, DNA methyltransferases 1, 
and 3b, and global DNA methylation by ELISA. RT-PCR was utilized to assess the 
expression of tumor regulatory genes (hTERT, DAPK, RARβ, and CDH1) and their 
promoter methylation in HeLa (HPV18-positive), SiHa (HPV16-positive) and C33a 
(HPV-negative) cervical cancer cell lines. ALA increased DNA demethylase, HMTs, 
and HATs while decreasing global DNA methylation, DNMT, HDMs, and HDACs mRNA 
expression/activity in all cervical cancer cell lines. ALA downregulated hTERT 
oncogene while upregulating the mRNA expression of TSGs (Tumor Suppressor Genes) 
CDH1, RARβ, and DAPK in all the cell lines. ALA reduced methylation in the 5' 
CpG island of CDH1, RARβ, and DAPK1 promoters and reduced global DNA methylation 
in cervical cancer cell lines. These results suggest that ALA regulates the 
growth of cervical cancer cells by targeting epigenetic markers, shedding light 
on its potential therapeutic role in cervical cancer management.

BACKGROUND: Epigenes are defined as proteins that perform post-translational 
modification of histones or DNA, reading of post-translational modifications, 
form complexes with epigenetic factors or changing the general structure of 
chromatin. This specialized group of proteins is responsible for controlling the 
organization of genomic DNA in a cell-type specific fashion, controlling normal 
development in a spatial and temporal fashion. Moreover, mutations in epigenes 
have been implicated as causal in germline pediatric disorders and as driver 
mutations in cancer. Despite their importance to human disease, to date, there 
has not been a systematic analysis of the sources of functional diversity for 
epigenes at large. Epigenes' unique functions that require the assembly of pools 
within the nucleus suggest that their structure and amino acid composition would 
have been enriched for features that enable efficient assembly of chromatin and 
DNA for transcription, splicing, and post-translational modifications.
RESULTS: In this study, we assess the functional diversity stemming from gene 
structure, isoforms, protein domains, and multiprotein complex formation that 
drive the functions of established epigenes. We found that there are specific 
structural features that enable epigenes to perform their variable roles 
depending on the cellular and environmental context. First, epigenes are 
significantly larger and have more exons compared with non-epigenes which 
contributes to increased isoform diversity. Second epigenes participate in more 
multimeric complexes than non-epigenes. Thirdly, given their proposed importance 
in membraneless organelles, we show epigenes are enriched for substantially 
larger intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). Additionally, we assessed the 
specificity of their expression profiles and showed epigenes are more 
ubiquitously expressed consistent with their enrichment in pediatric syndromes 
with intellectual disability, multiorgan dysfunction, and developmental delay. 
Finally, in the L1000 dataset, we identify drugs that can potentially be used to 
modulate expression of these genes.
CONCLUSIONS: Here we identify significant differences in isoform usage, 
disordered domain content, and variable binding partners between human epigenes 
and non-epigenes using various functional genomics datasets from Ensembl, 
ENCODE, GTEx, HPO, LINCS L1000, and BrainSpan. Our results contribute new 
knowledge to the growing field focused on developing targeted therapies for 
diseases caused by epigene mutations, such as chromatinopathies and cancers.

Stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) is a common malignancy with high heterogeneity and 
a lack of highly precise treatment options. We downloaded the multiomics data of 
STAD patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-STAD cohort, which included 
mRNA, microRNA, long non-coding RNA, somatic mutation, and DNA methylation data, 
from the sxdyc website. We synthesized the multiomics data of patients with STAD 
using 10 clustering methods, construct a consensus machine learning-driven 
signature (CMLS)-related prognostic models by combining 10 machine learning 
methods, and evaluated the prognosis models using the C-index. The prognostic 
relationship between CMLS and STAD was assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves, and 
the independent prognostic value of CMLS was determined by univariate and 
multivariate regression analyses. we also evaluated the immune characteristics, 
immunotherapy response, and drug sensitivity of different CMLS groups. The 
results of the multiomics analysis classified STAD into three subtypes, with CS1 
resulting in the best survival outcome. In total, 10 hub genes (CES3, AHCYL2, 
APOD, EFEMP1, CYP1B1, ASPN, CPE, CLIP3, MAP1B, and DKK1) were screened and 
constructed the CMLS was significantly correlated with prognosis in patients 
with STAD and was an independent prognostic factor for patients with STAD. Using 
the CMLS risk score, all patients were divided into a high CMLS group and a low 
CMLS group. Patients in the low-CMLS group had better survival, more enriched 
immune cells, and higher tumor mutation load scores, suggesting better 
immunotherapy responsiveness and a possible ""hot tumor"" phenotype. Patients in 
the high-CMLS group had a significantly poorer prognosis and were less sensitive 
to immunotherapy but were likely to benefit more from chemotherapy and targeted 
therapy. In this study, 10 clustering methods and 10 machine learning methods 
were combined to analyze the multiomics of STAD, classify STAD into three 
subtypes, and constructed CMLS-related prognostic model features, which are 
important for accurate management and effective treatment of STAD.

BACKGROUND: The rising incidence of breast cancer and its heterogeneity 
necessitate precise tools for predicting patient prognosis and tailoring 
personalized treatments. Epigenetic changes play a critical role in breast 
cancer progression and therapy responses, providing a foundation for prognostic 
model development.
METHODS: We developed the Machine Learning-derived Epigenetic Model (MLEM) to 
identify prognostic epigenetic gene patterns in breast cancer. Using 
multi-cohort transcriptomic datasets, MLEM was constructed with rigorous machine 
learning techniques and validated across independent datasets. The model's 
performance was further corroborated through immunohistochemical validation on 
clinical samples.
RESULTS: MLEM effectively stratified breast cancer patients into high- and 
low-risk groups. Low-MLEM patients exhibited improved prognosis, characterized 
by enhanced immune cell infiltration and higher responsiveness to immunotherapy. 
High-MLEM patients showed poorer prognosis but were more responsive to 
chemotherapy, with vincristine identified as a promising therapeutic option. The 
model demonstrated robust performance across independent validation datasets.
CONCLUSION: MLEM is a powerful prognostic tool for predicting breast cancer 
outcomes and tailoring personalized treatments. By integrating epigenetic 
insights with machine learning, this model has the potential to improve clinical 
decision-making and optimize therapeutic strategies for breast cancer patients.

Myelodysplastic Neoplasm (MDS) is a cancer associated with aging, often leading 
to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). One of its hallmarks is hypermethylation, 
particularly in genes responsible for DNA repair. This study aimed to evaluate 
the methylation and mutation status of DNA repair genes (single-strand - XPA, 
XPC, XPG, CSA, CSB and double-strand - ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, LIG4, RAD51) in MDS 
across three patient cohorts (Cohort A-56, Cohort B-100, Cohort C-76), using 
methods like pyrosequencing, real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry, and mutation 
screening. Results showed that XPA had higher methylation in low-risk MDS 
compared to high-risk MDS. For double-strand repair genes, ATM displayed higher 
methylation in patients who transformed to AML (p = 0.016). ATM gene expression 
was downregulated in MDS compared to controls (p = 0.042). When patients were 
classified according to the WHO 2022 guidelines, ATM expression progressively 
decreased from low-risk subtypes (e.g., Hypoplastic MDS) to high-risk MDS and 
AML. Patients who transformed to AML had a higher 5mC/5hmC ratio compared to 
those who didn't (p = 0.045). Additionally, poor cytogenetic risk patients had 
higher tissue methylation scores than those with good risk (p = 0.035). Analysis 
using the cBioPortal platform identified ATM as the most frequently mutated DNA 
repair gene, with various mutations, such as frameshift and missense, most of 
which were classified as oncogenic. The findings suggest that ATM is frequently 
silenced or downregulated in MDS due to methylation or mutations, contributing 
to the progression to AML. This highlights ATM's potential role in the disease's 
advancement and as a target for future therapeutic strategies.

BACKGROUND: To date, there is no effective cure for the highly malignant brain 
tumor glioblastoma (GBM). GBM is the most common, aggressive central nervous 
system tumor (CNS). It commonly originates in glial cells such as microglia, 
oligodendroglia, astrocytes, or subpopulations of cancer stem cells (CSCs). 
Glucose plays an important role in the, which energy metabolism of normal and 
cancer cells, but cancer cells exhibit an increased demand for glucose is 
required for their differentiation and proliferation. The main aim of this study 
is to explore the anti-cancer efficacy of the ketogenic diet against GBM. Also, 
this research focuses on the identification of the catalytic action of zinc in 
epigenetic modulators such as oxyresveratrol and ensures the combinatorial 
effect in the treatment of GBM.
METHOD: In this study, we have evaluated various parameters to understand the 
therapeutic efficacy of the treatment groups through in vivo experiments against 
aggressive brain tumors. Intracerebroventricular experiments were performed to 
induce the tumor in the animals and estimate the tumor burden and proliferative 
index. Followed by the Morris water maze, an open field test, and rota rod was 
performed to evaluate the memory and motor coordination. To understand the 
glucose, and ketone level modification before and after treatment, the level of 
glucose and ketone was analyzed. Moreover, the zinc level is assessed using 
flame atomic absorption spectroscopy.
RESULTS: The results suggested that the ketogenic diet has an anti-cancer 
efficacy against C6-induced GBM cell lines. Also, it exerts a synergistic effect 
with the epigenetic modulator, oxyresveratrol, and zinc against GBM cell lines. 
Moreover, the treatment groups improved memory and motor coordination and 
modified the glucose and ketone levels to reduce the tumor burden and Ki-67 
proliferative index.
CONCLUSION: This study revealed the therapeutic effect of the ketogenic diet 
along with its combination such as oxyresveratrol and zinc against the 
C6-induced GBM in the Wistar rats. Also, it improved memory and motor 
coordination and reduced tumor growth. It also modified the glucose and ketone 
levels in the tumor-induced animal and supported to diminish the tumor burden.

The DNA methylation of CYP24A1 can regulate its gene expression and may play a 
role in the occurrence and progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the 
association between CYP24A1 DNA methylation and the prognosis of CRC patients 
has not yet been reported. In this study, differential methylation analysis was 
conducted in both blood and tissue cohorts, and differential expression analysis 
was performed in the tissue cohort with in vitro validation. GO and KEGG 
enrichment analyses were performed on CYP24A1-related genes. A correlation 
between CYP24A1 promoter methylation and its gene expression was explored. 
Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox regression analyses were performed to investigate 
the impact of CYP24A1 DNA methylation on the prognosis of CRC patients. 
Prognostic risk scores were constructed for survival prediction. Immune 
infiltration analysis was also conducted. Our results showed that the 
hypermethylation of cg02712555 in tumor tissues (hazard ratio, 0.48; 95% 
confidence interval, 0.24-0.94; p = 0.032) and CpG site 41 in peripheral 
leukocytes (HR, 0.35; 95%CI, 0.14-0.84; p = 0.019) were both associated with 
decreased overall mortality in CRC patients. Prognostic risk scores showed 
robust predictive capabilities of these two CpG loci for the prognosis of CRC 
patients. CYP24A1 hypermethylation was positively correlated with infiltration 
levels of activated CD4 + T cells, activated CD8 + T cells, activated B cells, 
activated dendritic cells, and macrophages. Taken together, our findings 
indicate that the methylation levels of specific CpG sites within the CYP24A1 
promoter region in blood leukocytes and tumors are potential prognostic and 
predictive markers for overall survival in CRC patients.

Mutations in cancer risk genes increase susceptibility, but not all carriers 
develop cancer. Indeed, while DNA mutations are necessary drivers of cancer, 
only a small subset of mutated cells go on to cause the disease. To date, the 
mechanisms underlying individual cancer susceptibility remain unclear. Here, we 
took advantage of a unique mouse model of intrinsic developmental heterogeneity 
(Trim28+/D9) to investigate whether early-life epigenetic variation influences 
cancer susceptibility later in life. We found that heterozygosity of Trim28 is 
sufficient to generate two distinct early-life epigenetic states associated with 
differing cancer susceptibility. These developmentally primed states exhibit 
differential methylation patterns at typically silenced heterochromatin, 
detectable as early as 10 days of age. The differentially methylated loci are 
enriched for genes with known oncogenic potential, frequently mutated in human 
cancers and correlated with poor prognosis. This study provides genetic evidence 
that intrinsic developmental heterogeneity can prime individual, lifelong cancer 
susceptibility.

To integrate machine learning and multiomic data on lactylation-related genes 
(LRGs) for molecular typing and prognosis prediction in lung adenocarcinoma 
(LUAD). LRG mRNA and long non-coding RNA transcriptomes, epigenetic methylation 
data, and somatic mutation data from The Cancer Genome Atlas LUAD cohort were 
analyzed to identify lactylation cancer subtypes (CSs) using 10 multiomics 
ensemble clustering techniques. The findings were then validated using the 
GSE31210 and GSE13213 LUAD cohorts. A prognosis model for LUAD was developed 
using the identified hub LRGs to divide patients into high- and low-risk groups. 
The effectiveness of this model was validated. We identified two lactylation 
CSs, which were validated in the GSE31210 and GSE13213 LUAD cohorts. Nine hub 
LRGs, namely HNRNPC, PPIA, BZW1, GAPDH, H2AFZ, RAN, KIF2C, RACGAP1, and WBP11, 
were used to construct the prognosis model. In the subsequent prognosis 
validation, the high-risk group included more patients with stage T3 + 4, 
N1 + 2 + 3, M1, and III + IV cancer; higher recurrence/metastasis rates; and 
lower 1, 3, and 5 year overall survival rates. In the oncogenic pathway 
analysis, most of the oncogenic mutations were detected in the high-risk group. 
The tumor microenvironment analysis illustrated that immune activity was notably 
elevated in low-risk patients, indicating they might more strongly respond to 
immunotherapy than high-risk patients. Further, oncoPredict analysis revealed 
that low-risk patients have increased sensitivity to chemotherapeutics. Overall, 
we developed a model that combines multiomic analysis and machine learning for 
LUAD prognosis. Our findings represent a valuable reference for further 
understanding the important function of lactylation modification pathways in 
LUAD progression.

BACKGROUND: Endogenous retrovirus (ERV) elements are genomic footprints of 
ancestral retroviral infections within the human genome. While the dysregulation 
of ERV transcription has been linked to immune cell infiltration in various 
cancers, its relationship with immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) response in 
solid tumors, particularly metastatic clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), 
remains inadequately explored.
METHODS: This study analyzed patients with metastatic ccRCC from two prospective 
clinical trials, encompassing 181 patients receiving nivolumab in the CheckMate 
trials (-009 to -010 and -025) and 48 patients treated with the 
ipilimumab-nivolumab combination in the BIONIKK trial. ERV expression was 
quantified using the ERVmap algorithm from RNA sequencing data. Our primary 
objective was to correlate ERV expression with progression-free survival, with 
overall survival and time-to-second-treatment survival as secondary endpoints. 
We used bootstrap methods with univariate Cox regression on 666 substantially 
expressed ERVs to evaluate their prognostic significance and stability.
RESULTS: Our analysis centered on two ERVs, E4421_chr17 and E1659_chr4, which 
consistently exhibited opposing prognostic impacts across both cohorts. We 
developed a stratification system based on their median expression levels, 
categorizing patients into four ERV subgroups. These subgroups were further 
consolidated into a three-tier risk model that significantly correlated with ICI 
treatment outcomes. The most responsive ERV risk category showed enhanced 
endothelial cell infiltration, whereas the resistant category was characterized 
by higher levels of myeloid dendritic cells, regulatory T cells, myeloid-derived 
suppressor cells, and markers of T-cell exhaustion. Notably, this ERV-based 
classification outperformed traditional transcriptomic signatures in predicting 
ICI efficacy and showed further improvement when combined with epigenetic DNA 
methylation markers.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings introduce a dual ERV-based stratification system that 
effectively categorizes patient risk and predicts clinical outcomes for ccRCC 
patients undergoing ICI therapy. Beyond enhancing the predictive precision of 
existing transcriptomic models, this system paves the way for more targeted and 
individualized approaches in the realm of precision oncology.

Gastric cancer is a common digestive system tumor with a high resistance rate 
that reduces the sensitivity to chemotherapy. Nutrition therapy is an important 
adjuvant approach to favor the prognosis of gastric cancer. Dietary amino acids 
contribute greatly to gastric cancer progression by mediating tumor gene 
expressions, epigenetics, signal transduction, and metabolic remodeling. In the 
present study, 20 types of amino acids were screened and glutamine, glycine and 
serine were identified as the critical regulators of cisplatin (DDP) sensitivity 
in gastric cancer cells. Moreover, KDM4A acetylation drove the reduced 
chemotherapy sensitivity in gastric cancer cells by maintaining protein 
stability and activating DNA repair ability when the concentrations of glutamine 
(Gln), serine (Ser), and glycine (Gly) decreased. Conversely, Gln/Ser/Gly at 
increasing concentrations stimulated ubiquitination degradation of KDM4A, which 
in turn elevated the sensitivity of gastric cancer cells to chemotherapy. Our 
findings unveiled the role of amino acid nutrition in regulating chemotherapy 
sensitivity of gastric cancer and the underlying mechanism, thus providing a 
scientific basis for expanding the clinical significance of nutrition therapy 
for gastric cancer patients.

Recent therapeutic strategies have highlighted the potential of 
β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) as effective anticancer 
agents, particularly for colon cancer. These metabolites can modulate cellular 
metabolism and induce epigenetic changes, inhibiting tumor growth. Nonetheless, 
certain cancer cells may utilize ketone bodies, like BHB as nutrient sources 
under hypoxic conditions, potentially reducing treatment efficacy. Understanding 
these mechanisms is crucial for optimizing cancer therapies. This study 
evaluated the effects of BHB and α-KG on HCT-116 colorectal cancer cell 
viability under normoxic and low-glucose hypoxic conditions. HCT-116 cell lines 
were treated with different doses of BHB and α-KG in normoxic and low-glucose 
hypoxic conditions, and then cell viability was assessed by the MTT assay. 
Moreover, the mRNA expression levels of SRC, hypoxia-inducible factor 
1α (HIF-1α), acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase 1 (ACAT1), and sirtuin 2 (SIRT2) genes 
were determined using quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain 
reaction (q RT-PCR). BHB significantly increased the proliferation of HCT-116 
colon cancer cells under low-glucose hypoxic conditions, while α-KG maintained 
cell viability in normoxic conditions but not in hypoxia. BHB treatment reduced 
SIRT2 mRNA levels and increased ACAT1, SRC, and HIF-1α expression. Conversely, 
α-KG decreased ACAT1, SRC, and HIF-1α expression and increased SIRT2 levels in 
normoxia but could not reverse gene expression during hypoxia. Our study 
demonstrated that BHB and α-KG exhibited complex interactions with colon cancer 
cell viability under varying oxygen and glucose conditions. While BHB promoted 
cell proliferation in hypoxic environments, α-KG showed protective effects in 
normoxic conditions. This research contributed to the growing body of evidence 
supporting the role of metabolic modulators in cancer therapy and emphasized the 
importance of understanding tumor microenvironments to optimize treatment 
outcomes. However, the need for further research into the metabolic pathways is 
underscored to enhance therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment.

The increasing shift from cannabis smoking to cannabis vaping is largely driven 
by the perception that vaping to form an aerosol represents a safer alternative 
to smoking and is a form of consumption appealing to youth. Herein, we compared 
the chemical composition and receptor-mediated activity of cannabis smoke 
extract (CaSE) to cannabis vaping extract (CaVE) along with the biological 
response in human bronchial epithelial cells. Chemical analysis using HPLC and 
GC/MS revealed that cannabis vaping aerosol contained fewer toxicants than 
smoke; CaSE and CaVE contained teratogens, carcinogens, and respiratory 
toxicants. A bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET)-based biosensor 
detected the receptor-mediated activity of the extracts, primarily driven by 
Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) concentration. RNA-sequencing showed both CaSE 
and CaVE induced similar transcriptional responses, significantly upregulating 
genes within pathways related to inflammation, cancer, and cellular stress. This 
was paralleled by downregulation of pathways related to lipid synthesis and 
metabolism from both CaSE and CaVE. Targeted metabolomics revealed significant 
changes in metabolites involved in lipid and membrane metabolism, energy 
production, nucleotide/DNA/RNA pathways, and oxidative stress response, 
suggesting potential impairment of lung epithelial cell repair and function. In 
addition, the upregulation of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) indicates 
epigenetic changes potentially contributing to inflammation, oxidative stress, 
and an increased risk of cancer. These findings challenge the notion that 
cannabis vaping is risk-free, highlighting an urgent need for comprehensive 
research into its respiratory health effects. This comparison of cannabis 
consumption methods offers insights that could inform public health policies and 
raise consumer awareness regarding the potential risks of inhaling cannabis 
aerosol.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Cannabis use is increasing worldwide amid broad 
acceptance and legalization. The prevalence of traditional smoking is 
diminishing in favor of vaping dry flower. This is the first study to provide 
initial evidence that cannabis aerosol contains carcinogenic, teratogenic, and 
respiratory toxicants that induce transcriptional responses in epithelial cells 
analogous to those from cannabis smoke, suggesting potential adverse pulmonary 
effects.

Epigenetic alterations are hallmarks of cancer, with histone modifiers playing 
critical roles in gene transcription, DNA homeostasis, and other nuclear 
functions. Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1), a key regulator of H3K4 
methylation, has emerged as a promising pharmacological target in cancer 
treatment, including leukemia. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the most 
common pediatric cancer, remains a significant therapeutic challenge due to 
limited understanding of how epigenetic therapy impacts leukemia dissemination. 
In this study, we demonstrate that targeting LSD1 enhances the invasive capacity 
of ALL cells, inducing an elongated, invasive phenotype and increasing nuclear 
deformability. Using a 3D matrix model, LSD1 inhibition promoted ALL cell 
invasion without significantly affecting the cell cycle progression or apoptosis 
under the tested conditions. Interestingly, LSD1 targeting reduced ALL cell 
spreading and tissue colonization in vivo, suggesting differential effects 
depending on the cellular context. Our findings indicate that LSD1 inhibition 
impairs chemotactic responses and transendothelial migration, key processes for 
extravasation and in vivo invasiveness. These results reveal a dual role for 
LSD1 in leukemia cell migration: promoting invasiveness in 3D environments while 
reducing extravasation and chemotaxis in vivo. This dual effect underscores the 
importance of cellular context in determining therapeutic outcomes and the 
development of strategies targeting specific stages of leukemia dissemination.

The aging process will lead to a gradual functional decline in the human body, 
and even accelerate a significantly increased risk of degenerative diseases. DNA 
methylation patterns change markedly with one's age, serving as a biomarker of 
biological age and closely linked to the occurrence and progression of 
age-related diseases. Currently, diagnostic methods for individual degenerative 
diseases are relatively mature. However, aging often accompanies the onset of 
multiple degenerative diseases, presenting certain limitations in existing 
diagnostic models. Additionally, some identified DNA methylation biomarkers are 
typically applicable to only one or a few types of cancer or diseases, further 
restricting their utility. We endeavor to screen for biomarkers associated with 
multiple degenerative diseases from the perspective of aging-related co-morbid 
mechanisms and to perform multiple degenerative disease diagnoses. In this 
study, we explored research based on methylation correlations and patterns to 
investigate shared mechanisms across multiple degenerative diseases, identifying 
a set of biomarkers associated with them. We validated these biomarkers with 
biological omics analysis and the prediction of multiple classes of degenerative 
diseases, screened the biomarkers from 600 to 110 by biological omics analysis, 
and demonstrated the validity and predictive ability of the screened 110 
biomarkers. We propose a disease diagnostic model based on a multi-scale 
one-dimensional convolutional neural network (MSDCNN) and a multi-class 
degenerative disease prediction model (ResDegNet). The two models are well 
trained and tested to accurately diagnose diseases and categorize four types of 
degenerative diseases. The research identified 110 biomarkers associated with 
degenerative diseases, providing a foundation for further exploration of 
age-related degenerative conditions. This work aims to facilitate early 
diagnosis, the identification of biomarkers, and the development of therapeutic 
targets for drug interventions.

DNA methylation is a crucial epigenetic modification that orchestrates chromatin 
remodelers that suppress transcription, and aberrations in DNA methylation 
result in a variety of conditions such as cancers and developmental disorders. 
While it is understood that methylation occurs at CpG-rich DNA regions, it is 
less understood how distinct methylation profiles are established within various 
cell types. In this work, we develop a molecular-transport model that depicts 
the genomic exploration of DNA methyltransferase within a multiscale DNA 
environment, incorporating biologically relevant factors like methylation rate 
and CpG density to predict how patterns are established. Our model predicts DNA 
methylation-state correlation distributions arising from the transport and 
kinetic properties that are crucial for the establishment of unique methylation 
profiles. We model the methylation correlation distributions of nine cancerous 
human cell types to determine how these properties affect the epigenetic 
profile. Our theory is capable of recapitulating experimental methylation 
patterns, suggesting the importance of DNA methyltransferase transport in 
epigenetic regulation. Through this work, we propose a mechanistic description 
for the establishment of methylation profiles, capturing the key behavioral 
characteristics of methyltransferase that lead to aberrant methylation.

DNA methylation is a crucial epigenetic modification used as a biomarker for 
early cancer progression. However, existing methods for DNA methylation analysis 
are complex, time-consuming, and prone to DNA degradation. This work 
demonstrates selective capture of unmethylated DNAs using ZnO nanowires without 
chemical or biological modifications, thereby concentrating methylated DNA, 
particularly those with high methylation levels that can predict cancer risk. We 
observe varying affinities between methylated and unmethylated DNA on ZnO 
nanowires, which may be influenced by differences in hydrogen bonding strength, 
potentially related to the effects of methylation on DNA strand behavior, 
including self-aggregation and stretching inhibition. As a result, the 
nanowire-based microfluidic device effectively collects unmethylated DNA, 
leading to a significantly increased ratio of methylated to unmethylated DNA, 
particularly for collecting low-concentration methylated DNA. This simplified 
microfluidic device, composed of ZnO nanowires, enables direct separation of 
specific methylated DNA, offering a potential approach for DNA methylation 
mapping in clinical disease diagnostics.

Mesothelioma is a lethal cancer of the serosal lining of the body cavities. Risk 
factors include environmental and genetic factors. Asbestos exposure is 
considered the principal environmental risk factor, but other carcinogenic 
mineral fibers, such as erionite, also have a causal role. Pathogenic germline 
(heritable) mutations of specific genes, especially BAP1, are thought to 
predispose the individual to mesothelioma in about 10% of cases. Somatic 
mutations and deletions of specific tumor suppressor genes, particularly BAP1, 
CDKN2A/B, and NF2, occur frequently in human mesothelioma, and asbestos-exposed 
mice with heterozygous deletions of any one of these genes have been shown to 
develop mesothelioma more often and at an accelerated rate than in control 
animals. Autochthonous mesothelioma mouse models, which are genetically 
engineered to carry multiple genetic lesions matching those observed in the 
human disease counterpart, closely resemble the disease phenotype and the 
extensive inflammatory responses that characterize human mesothelioma. Because 
autochthonous mice do not require asbestos exposure and form tumors rapidly, 
these models are invaluable for assessing novel therapeutic strategies in an 
immunocompetent setting. The overlapping genetic, epigenetic, and immune 
environments of the tumors observed in these genetically engineered mouse models 
(GEMMs) and human primary mesothelioma specimens support the clinical relevance 
of these preclinical models. This article presents protocols for studies of 
asbestos-induced mesothelioma in GEMMs and non-carcinogenic conditional knockout 
models of mesothelioma, including an example of a preclinical application. These 
models are invaluable for understanding the biological underpinnings of 
mesothelioma and for testing new therapeutics and chemoprevention or 
interception agents. © 2025 Wiley Periodicals LLC. Basic Protocol 1: Generation

The short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) propionate and butyrate have beneficial 
health effects, are produced in large amounts by microbial metabolism and have 
been identified as unique acyl lysine histone marks. To better understand the 
function of these modifications, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation followed 
by sequencing to map the genome-wide location of four short-chain acyl histone 
marks, H3K18pr, H3K18bu, H4K12pr and H4K12bu, in treated and untreated 
colorectal cancer (CRC) and normal cells as well as in mouse intestines in vivo. 
We correlate these marks with open chromatin regions and gene expression to 
access the function of the target regions. Our data demonstrate that propionate 
and butyrate bind and act as promoters of genes involved in growth, 
differentiation and ion transport. We propose a mechanism involving direct 
modification of specific genomic regions by SCFAs resulting in increased 
chromatin accessibility and, in the case of butyrate, opposing effects on the 
proliferation of normal versus CRC cells.

BACKGROUND: An increasing body of evidence has linked fructose intake to 
colorectal cancer (CRC). African-American (AA) adults consume greater quantities 
of fructose and are more likely to develop right-side colon cancer than European 
American (EA) adults.
OBJECTIVES: We examined the hypothesis that fructose consumption leads to 
epigenomic and transcriptomic differences associated with CRC tumor biology.
METHODS: Deoxyribonucleic acid methylation data from this cross-sectional study 
was obtained using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC kit (GSE151732). Right 
and left colon differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified using 
DMRcate through analysis of Food Frequency Questionnaire data on fructose 
consumption in normal colon biopsies (n = 79) of AA adults undergoing screening 
colonoscopy. Secondary analysis of CRC tumors was carried out using data derived 
from The Cancer Genome Atlas Colon Adenocarcinoma, GSE101764, and GSE193535. 
Right colon organoids derived from AA (n = 5) and EA (n = 5) adults were exposed 
to 4.4 mM of fructose for 72 h. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were 
identified using DESeq2.
RESULTS: We identified 4263 right colon fructose-associated DMRs 
[false-discovery rates (FDR) < 0.05]. In contrast, only 24 DMRs survived 
multiple testing corrections (FDR < 0.05) in matched, left colon. Almost 50% of 
right colon fructose-associated DMRs overlapped regions implicated in CRC in ≥1 
of 3 data sets. Highly significant enrichment was also observed between genes 
corresponding to right colon fructose-associated DMRs and DEGs associated with 
fructose exposure in right colon organoids of AA individuals (P = 3.28E-30). 
Overlapping and significant enrichments for fatty acid metabolism, glycolysis, 
and cell proliferation pathways were also found. Cross-referencing genes within 
these pathways to DEGs in CRC tumors reveal potential roles for ankyrin repeat 
domain containing protein 23 and phosphofructokinase, platelet in 
fructose-mediated CRC risk for AA individuals.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data support that dietary fructose exerts a greater CRC 
risk-related effect in the right than left colon among AA adults, alluding to 
its potential role in contributing to racial disparities in CRC.

BACKGROUND: Recent advancements in contemporary therapeutic approaches have 
increased the survival rates of lung cancer patients; however, the long-term 
benefits remain constrained, underscoring the pressing need for novel 
biomarkers. Surfactant-associated 3 (SFTA3), a long non-coding RNA predominantly 
expressed in normal lung epithelial cells, plays a crucial role in lung 
development. Nevertheless, its function in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remains 
inadequately understood.
METHODS: Single-cell RNA sequencing data were utilized to identify novel cancer 
cell-intrinsic gene signatures associated with the progression of LUAD, and 
their roles in LUAD were comprehensively analyzed. Serum samples were collected 
to quantify the expression levels of SFTA3 in LUAD patients. Furthermore, a 
series of biological experiments, including cell viability assays, scratch wound 
healing assays, and colony formation assays, were conducted to demonstrate the 
tumor-suppressive effects of SFTA3. RNA sequencing was performed to elucidate 
the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of SFTA3 in lung cancer cells.
RESULTS: We constructed a prognostic model comprising eight genes: ALDOA, 
ATP5MD, SERPINH1, SFTA3, SLK, U2SURP, SCGB1A1, and SCGB1A3. The model 
effectively stratified patients into high- and low-risk categories, revealing 
that low-risk patients experienced superior clinical outcomes, exhibited an 
immunologically hot tumor microenvironment (TME), and had a greater probability 
of responding to immunotherapy. In contrast, the high-risk group exhibited a 
cold TME and may benefit more from chemotherapy. Furthermore, our study revealed 
that a progressive decrease in SFTA3 expression in cancer cells was correlated 
with tumor advancement. Notably, the serum levels of SFTA3 significantly 
decreased in patients with LUAD, suggesting its potential utility in liquid 
biopsy for LUAD diagnosis. Additionally, the knockdown of SFTA3 enhances the 
proliferation and migration of lung cancer cells, whereas its overexpression 
inhibits these phenotypes. The epithelial-mesenchymal transition pathway was 
significantly enriched following SFTA3 silencing, suggesting that SFTA3 may 
impact tumor progression by modulating this process. We also identified key 
transcription factors and epigenetic mechanisms implicated in the downregulation 
of SFTA3 in LUAD.
CONCLUSION: We developed a robust prognostic model and identified SFTA3 as a 
novel biomarker with potential applications in the diagnosis, prognosis, and 
personalized treatment of LUAD. Additionally, our findings offer new insights 
into the mechanisms underlying LUAD tumorigenesis and immune evasion.

Liquid biopsy enables real-time monitoring of tumor development and response to 
therapy through the analysis of CTCs and ctDNA. NALCN is a sodium leak channel 
that is frequently involved in tumor evolution and immunity and acts as a tumor 
suppressor. Deletion of NALCN has been shown to increase cancer metastasis and 
the number of CTCs in peripheral blood. In this study, we investigated for the 
first time NALCN promoter methylation in (a) Aza-treated cell lines (A549, 
TE671, BT20, and MDA-MB-468), (b) paired NSCLC tissues (n = 22), and (c) plasma 
cell-free DNA (ctDNA) from patients with NSCLC (early stage n = 39, metastatic n 
= 39) and DNA from 10 healthy donors (HD) using a newly developed highly 
specific and sensitive real-time MSP method. Treatment with 5'-aza-dC induced 
the expression of NALCN only in the A549 cell line, suggesting that DNA 
methylation regulates its expression in certain cancers. The mRNA expression 
levels of NALCN were quantified in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and 
adjacent non-cancerous tissues, and it was found to be underexpressed in 54.5% 
of tumor tissues, with significantly higher expression in recurrence-free 
patients (p = 0.009) than in patients who relapsed. The NALCN methylation level 
was not statisticallysignificantlycorrelated with the corresponding expression 
(p = 0.439), while Kaplan-Meier analysis showed an association between NALCN 
promoter hypermethylation and worse disease-free intervals (DFIs) (p = 0.017). 
Evaluation of NALCN methylation in ctDNA revealed that it was detected in 5.1% 
of early and 10.2% of advanced cases. Our results strongly suggest that 
epigenetic inactivation of NALCN may be a predictor of metastasis in NSCLC. Our 
results should be validated in further studies based on a larger patient cohort 
to further investigate whether DNA methylation of the NALCN promoter could serve 
as a potential prognostic DNA methylation biomarker and predictor of metastasis 
in NSCLC.

Organophosphate pesticides (OPPs) are widely used chemical pesticides in all the 
developed countries. Among the OPPs, Chlorpyrifos (CPF) is predominantly used 
and has been linked to various adverse health effects from acute to chronic 
exposure. Exposure to pesticides both occupationally and environmentally causes 
frequent human health problems including neurological disorders, liver, kidney 
dysfunctions and cancer. The acute and chronic effects of these environmental 
toxicants have been linked to epigenetic changes that appear shortly after 
exposure, but can last for a lifetime and possibly be passed down through 
generations. The present study investigates the effects of acute and chronic 
exposure to CPF, the predominantly used OPP globally on human liver cells, 
focusing on the induction of DNA damage and epigenetic alterations. Human normal 
liver cells (WRL-68) were acutely and chronically exposed to varying 
concentrations of CPF. The results revealed significant DNA damage, epigenetic 
changes and the onset of neoplastic transformation as evidenced by alterations 
in the DNA repair genes, DNA methyltransferases markers, cell cycle markers, 
epithelial to mesenchymal transition markers (EMT) and loss of apoptosis. 
Additionally, chronic CPF exposure led to increased colony formation, 
proliferation and migratory properties of normal liver cells indicating the 
neoplastic transformation of these cells. These findings highlight the potential 
of CPF to disrupt the cellular integrity and promote carcinogenesis in the liver 
cells. The present study underscores the impact of chronic CPF exposure in the 
initiation of cancer and also highlights the importance of continued research to 
fully understand the chronic health implications of CPF, for developing targeted 
interventions to mitigate its carcinogenic risks.

Prostate cancer is a widespread health issue that affects men worldwide. It is 
one of the most common forms of cancer, and its development is influenced by a 
combination of hereditary, epigenetic, environmental, age, and lifestyle 
factors. Given that it is the second most common cause of cancer-related deaths 
in men, it is crucial to comprehend its complex facets. Present research 
especially targets the 3-kinase/protein kinase B, Epidermal Growth Factor 
Receptor, and extracellular signal-related kinase pathways, which are known to 
be significantly involved in prostate cancer progression. Here, Rutin 
derivatives were screened against selected prostate cancer targets. Molecular 
docking was performed to identify favorable interactions and the most promising 
compound. Further, Density functional theory, pharmacokinetics, Molecular 
dynamics simulation, principal component analysis, free energy landscape 
analysis, and Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area provided 
additional insights into selecting the best drug candidate. Among all the 
selected rutin derivatives, RU4b1 has potent inhibitory action. We also 
performed predictive analysis to identify the distinct metabolic sites within 
the structure of RU4b1. RU4b1 also exhibits drug-like properties and potent 
antioxidant activity. The findings were also compared with standard drugs and 
reference molecules of the respective proteins, and it is noteworthy that RU4b1 
exhibited superior action compared to the standard drugs and reference 
molecules. This study aims to contribute valuable insights into developing 
targeted therapies for prostate cancer, emphasizing the potential of rutin 
derivatives as effective anti-cancer agents.

Mycosis fungoides (MF) is a neoplasm of the immune system. It is a cutaneous 
lymphoma originating in the peripheral epidermotropic T-cells, specifically the 
memory T-cells (CD45RO+). The etiology of MF is indefinite, but various factors, 
such as genetic and epigenetic abnormalities, environmental and occupational 
exposure to chemicals, infections, and cytokines (interleukin [IL]-2, IL-4, 
etc.), play a vital role. Pityriasis lichenoides (PL), such as MF, is a rare 
subtype that is presented with skin lesions similar to that of PL.

Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is an aggressive cancer characterized by a high 
risk of relapse post-surgery. Current follow-up methods (serum carcinoembryonic 
antigen detection and PET-CT) lack sensitivity and reliability, necessitating a 
novel approach. Analyzing cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from blood plasma emerges as a 
promising avenue. This study aims to evaluate the cost-effective and genome-wide 
cell-free reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (cfRRBS) method combined 
with computational deconvolution for effective disease monitoring in EAC 
patients. cfDNA methylation profiling with cfRRBS was performed on 162 blood 
plasma samples from 33 EAC cancer patients and 28 blood plasma samples from 20 
healthy donors. The estimated tumor fraction for EAC patients at the time of 
diagnosis was significantly different from the healthy donor plasma samples 
(one-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test: p-value = 0.032). Tumor fractions above 15% 
and focal gains/amplifications in MYC (chr8), KRAS (chr12), EGFR (chr7) and 
NOTCH2 (chr1) were observed in four samples of distinct patients at the time 
metastatic disease was detected. This study showed feasibility to estimate tumor 
fractions in blood plasma of EAC patients based on cfDNA methylation using 
cfRRBS and computational deconvolution. Nevertheless, in this study only cancer 
patients with evidence of metastatic disease show high tumor fractions and copy 
number alterations.

BACKGROUND: Esophageal cancer (ECa) is one of the most deadly cancers, with 
increasing incidence worldwide and poor prognosis. While endoscopy is 
recommended for the detection of ECa in high-risk individuals, it is not 
suitable for large-scale screening due to its invasiveness and inconvenience.
METHODS: In this study, a novel gene methylation panel was developed for a 
blood-based test, and its diagnostic efficacy was evaluated using a cohort of 
304 participants (203 cases, 101 controls). The assessment focused on the DNA 
methylation levels of SEPTIN9, tissue factor pathway inhibitor 2 (TFPI2), and 
the fragile histidine triad gene (FHIT) in patients with ECa, benign esophageal 
disease, and healthy controls. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve 
was generated for the panel to calculate the area under the curve (AUC), 
sensitivity, specificity, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), along with a 
comparison to the gold standard of pathological examination. The consistency 
between biomarker and pathological diagnosis was evaluated with kappa analysis 
conducted with IBM SPSS Statistics. The Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test 
was utilized to assess the association of test positivity with demographic 
characteristics.
RESULTS: In patients with ECa, SEPTIN9, TFPI2, and FHIT DNA methylation levels 
were significantly higher compared to those with benign esophageal disease or 
healthy controls. The panel demonstrated promising potential as a noninvasive 
tool for distinguishing malignant tumors from both healthy controls and benign 
esophageal diseases, achieving an area under the ROC curve of 0.925 (95% CI: 
0.889-0.952), with a sensitivity of 79.8% [95% CI 73.6-85.1%] and specificity of 
95.0% [95% CI 88.8-98.4%]. In particular, the panel showed exceptional 
diagnostic efficiency for stage 0, I, and II cancer patients with sensitivity at 
69.0, 75.5%, and 78.9%, respectively. The comparison revealed a Kappa value of 
0.725 between RT-PCR testing and the established gold standard of pathological 
examination, indicating a high level of consistency. Additionally, there was no 
bias in diagnostic efficiency based on age, gender, or the presence of other 
malignancies (non-esophageal cancers).
CONCLUSIONS: The study's findings suggested that the DNA methylation biomarkers 
panel holds promise as a non-invasive and convenient diagnostic test for ECa. 
The panel's ability to distinguish malignant tumors from benign esophageal 
diseases, coupled with its high sensitivity and specificity, presented 
opportunities to enhance the over-all diagnosis of high-risk population when in 
conjunction with existing detection methods.

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are important environmental carcinogens 
that can cause lung cancer. However, the underlying epigenetic mechanism during 
PAHs-induced lung carcinogenesis has remained largely unknown. Previously, we 
screened some novel epigenetic regulatory genes during 3-methylcholanthrene 
(3-MCA)-induced lung carcinogenesis, including the potassium inwardly rectifying 
channel subfamily J member 15 (KCNJ15) gene. This study aimed to investigate the 
expression regulation, function, and mechanism of KCNJ15 through database 
analysis, malignant transformed cell model, and xenograft tumor models. We found 
that KCNJ15 was remarkably under-expressed during lung carcinogenesis and 
progression. High levels of DNA methylation led to low KCNJ15 expression in 
3-MCA-induced malignantly transformed HBE cells. High expression of KCNJ15 was 
positively correlated with good survival prognosis in lung cancer patients. 
KCNJ15 overexpression significantly inhibited the growth, invasion, and 
migration of lung cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. Knockdown of KCNJ15 
resulted in an opposite phenotype. KCNJ15 regulated the Hippo pathway by 
activating YAP phosphorylation and inhibiting YAP expression. There was a 
significant protein-protein interaction between KCNJ15 and the G protein subunit 
beta 1 (GNB1). GNB1 overexpression effectively reduced the effect of KCNJ15 on 
Hippo pathway. Our data demonstrated that KCNJ15, as a novel epigenetic 
silencing tumor suppressor, regulates cell growth, invasion, and migration by 
interaction with GNB1 protein mediating the Hippo-YAP signaling pathway during 
chemical-induced lung carcinogenesis and progression. It provides novel insights 
into epigenetic regulation mechanism during carcinogenesis induced by 
environmental pollutants.

BACKGROUNDCurrent clinical sequencing methods cannot effectively detect DNA 
methylation and allele-specific variation to provide parent-of-origin 
information from the proband alone. Parent-of-origin effects can lead to 
differential disease, and the inability to assign parent of origin in de novo 
cases limits prognostication in the majority of affected individuals with 
retinoblastoma, a hereditary cancer with suspected parent-of-origin 
effects.METHODSTo directly assign parent of origin in patients with 
retinoblastoma, we extracted genomic DNA from blood samples for sequencing using 
a programmable, targeted, single-molecule, long-read DNA genomic and epigenomic 
approach. This allowed germline variant calling and simultaneous 
haplotype-resolved CpG methylation in participants with familial (n = 7) and de 
novo (n = 9) retinoblastoma.RESULTSTargeted long-read sequencing allowed phasing 
genomic variation with a differentially methylated region in intron 2 of the 
retinoblastoma gene to confirm parent of origin in known familial samples. This 
approach allowed us to directly assign parent of origin in simple and complex de 
novo cases from the proband alone. The ability to assign parent of origin in all 
retinoblastoma cases showed that harboring disease-causing variants on the 
paternally inherited allele, whether arising familially or de novo, was 
associated with more advanced cancer staging at presentation and significantly 
greater risk of chemotherapy failure (P = 0.002).CONCLUSIONThis study 
demonstrates the diagnostic potential of multiomic long-read profiling to unveil 
the parent-of-origin effect in hereditary cancer. The approach in this work will 
be instrumental in assigning parent of origin to other genetic diseases using 
local and distant imprinting signals in the genome.FUNDINGNational Eye

Cancer progression involves genetic and epigenetic changes that disrupt 
chromatin 3D organization, affecting enhancer-promoter interactions and 
promoting growth. Here, we provide an integrative approach, combining chromatin 
conformation, accessibility, and transcription analysis, validated by in silico 
and CRISPR-interference screens, to identify relevant 3D topologies in pediatric 
T cell leukemia (T-ALL and ETP-ALL). We characterize 3D hubs as regulatory 
centers for oncogenes and disease markers, linking them to biological processes 
like cell division, inflammation, and stress response. Single-cell mapping 
reveals heterogeneous gene activation in discrete epigenetic clones, aiding in 
patient stratification for relapse risk after chemotherapy. Finally, we identify 
MYB as a 3D hub regulator in leukemia cells and show that the targeting of key 
regulators leads to hub dissolution, thereby providing a novel and effective 
anti-leukemic strategy. Overall, our work demonstrates the relevance of studying 
oncogenic 3D hubs to better understand cancer biology and tumor heterogeneity 
and to propose novel therapeutic strategies.

Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common extracranial solid tumor in children. 
Despite treatment advances, the survival rates of high-risk NB patients remain 
low. This highlights the urgent need for a deeper understanding of the molecular 
mechanisms driving NB progression to support the development of new therapeutic 
strategies. In this study, we demonstrated that the reduced levels of DNAJC12, a 
protein involved in metabolic regulation, are associated with poor prognosis in 
NB patients. Our data indicate that low DNAJC12 expression activates glycolysis 
in NB cells, leading to increased lactic acid production and histone H4 lysine 5 
lactylation (H4K5la). Elevated H4K5la upregulates the transcription of COL1A1, a 
gene implicated in cell metastasis. Immunohistochemistry staining of NB patient 
samples confirmed that high H4K5la levels correlate with poor clinical outcomes. 
Furthermore, we showed that inhibiting glycolysis, reducing H4K5la, or targeting 
COL1A1 can mitigate the invasive behavior of NB cells. These findings reveal a 
critical link between metabolic reprogramming and epigenetic modifications in 
the context of NB progression, suggesting that H4K5la could serve as a novel 
diagnostic and prognostic marker, and shed light on identifying new therapeutic 
targets within metabolic pathways for the treatment of this aggressive pediatric 
cancer.

BACKGROUND: DNA methylation (DNAm) influences both sex differences and cancer 
development, yet the mechanisms connecting these factors remain unclear.
METHODS: Utilizing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we conducted a 
comprehensive analysis of sex-related DNAm effects in nine non-reproductive 
cancers, compared to paired normal adjacent tissues (NATs), and validated the 
results using independent datasets. First, we assessed the extent of sex 
differential DNAm between cancers and NATs to explore how sex-related DNAm 
differences change in cancerous tissues. Next, we employed a multivariate 
adaptive shrinkage approach to model the covariance of cancer-related DNAm 
effects between sexes, aiming to elucidate how sex impacts aberrant DNAm 
patterns in cancers. Finally, we investigated correlations between the methylome 
and transcriptome to identify key signals driving sex-biased DNAm regulation in 
cancers.
RESULTS: Our analysis revealed a significant attenuation of sex differences in 
DNAm within cancerous tissues compared to baseline differences in normal 
tissues. We identified 3,452 CpGs (Pbonf < 0.05) associated with this reduction, 
with 72% of the linked genes involved in X chromosome inactivation. Through 
covariance analysis, we demonstrated that sex differences in cancer are 
predominantly driven by variations in the magnitude of shared DNAm signals, 
referred to as ""amplification."" Based on these patterns, we classified cancers 
into female- and male-biased groups and identified key CpGs exhibiting 
sex-specific amplification. These CpGs were enriched in binding sites of 
critical transcription factors, including P53, SOX2, and CTCF. Integrative 
multi-omics analyses uncovered 48 CpG-gene-cancer trios for females and 380 for 
males, showing similar magnitude differences in DNAm and gene expression, 
pointing to a sex-specific regulatory role of DNAm in cancer risk. Notably, 
several genes regulated by these trios were previously identified as drug 
targets for cancers, highlighting their potential as sex-specific therapeutic 
targets.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings advance our understanding of how sex, DNAm, and gene 
expression interact in cancer, offering insights into the development of 
sex-specific biomarkers and precision medicine.

Plain Language Summary: Sex disparities in non-reproductive cancers are 
well-documented across various aspects, including incidence, survival, 
mortality, and treatment outcomes. A deeper understanding of these differences 
could support the development of personalized therapeutic strategies. In this 
study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of sex-related DNA methylation 
(DNAm) effects in nine non-reproductive cancers, comparing cancer tissues with 
paired normal adjacent tissues (NATs). Our findings revealed that DNAm 
differences between males and females were significantly reduced in cancerous 
tissues. The CpGs associated with this reduction were linked to pathways 
involving the tumor microenvironment. Additionally, we found that these sex 
differences in cancer were primarily driven by variations in the effect sizes of 
shared DNAm signals, allowing us to classify cancers into male-biased (BLCA, 
THCA, KIRP, LUAD, and HNSC) and female-biased (LUSC, LIHC, COAD, and KIRC) 
groups. Notably, we found that differential expression in cancers was correlated 
with differential methylation in a sex-specific manner, through concordant 
magnitude differences within each sex. Several of these genes, regulated by DNAm 
changes, were already targets of cancer drugs (e.g., ECSCR, GATA2, and ERBB3), 
highlighting the potential for developing sex-specific treatments. Overall, this 
research enhances our understanding of the role of DNAm in cancer and could 
contribute to more personalized therapies for both males and females.

BACKGROUND: Deoxyribose nucleic acid (DNA) methylation is an important 
epigenetic modification that plays an important role in the occurrence and 
development of tumors. Identifying key methylation-driven genes that affect the 
prognosis of lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) can provide direction for 
targeted therapy research.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Methylation and RNA-seq data were downloaded from The 
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The MethylMix package was used to integrate and 
analyze the methylation and gene expression data from TCGA, and the LUSC dataset 
(GSE37745) was downloaded from GEO for validation. Forty-five 
DNA-methylation-driven genes (MDGs) were obtained, and 3 genes (TRIM61, SMIM22, 
and ALDH7A1) were significantly associated with survival by using univariate and 
multivariate Cox regression. A risk model was constructed. KM analysis showed 
that patients with high-risk scores had poor survival. A nomination plot for 
prognosis prediction of LUSC patients was constructed, which showed a good 
predictive efficiency for tumor prognosis. The high expression of ALDH7A1 was an 
independent risk factor for poor prognosis in LUSC. The expression of ALDH7A1 in 
LUSC was negatively correlated with its methylation status (COR = -0.655). GSEA 
analysis showed that high expression of ALDH7A1 could activate multiple 
signaling pathways (JAK-STAT signaling pathway and mTOR signaling pathway). In 
vitro cell experiments confirmed that in LUSC, silencing ALDH7A1 could inhibit 
tumor progression, while overexpression of ALDH7A1 could promote tumor 
progression.
CONCLUSION: Our results indicated that ALDH7A1, a newly discovered MDG in LUSC, 
could act as an independent prognostic factor for OS in LUSC, with the potential 
to become a potential target for LUSC diagnosis and treatment. High expression 
of ALDH7A1 in LUSC could promote the occurrence and development of tumors. 
Signaling pathways, such as JAK-STAT and mTOR signaling pathways, might regulate 
the high expression of ALDH7A1.

BACKGROUND: Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) exhibits a complex microenvironment 
with diverse cell populations influencing patient prognosis. Single-cell RNA 
sequencing (scRNA-seq) was used to identify prognosis-related cell types, and 
DNA methylation (DNAm)-based models were developed to predict outcomes based on 
their cellular characteristics.
METHODS: We integrated scRNA-seq, bulk data, and clinical information to 
identify key cell populations associated with prognosis. The TCGA dataset was 
used for validation, and cell composition was inferred from DNAm data. 
Prognostic models were constructed based on cell-type-specific DNAm markers, and 
genomic features were compared across risk groups. Nomograms were created to 
assess treatment responses in different risk levels.
RESULTS: Epithelial and T cells were major prognostic factors. Genomic analysis 
showed that epithelial cells in PDAC followed a malignant trajectory. DNAm data 
from TCGA confirmed the association of higher epithelial and T cell proportions 
with worse prognosis. Prognostic models based on DNAm markers of these cells 
effectively predicted patient survival, especially 5-year overall survival 
(AUC = 0.834). High-risk group with epithelial cell model showed altered 
pathways (tight junctions, NOTCH, and P53 signaling), while high-risk group 
with T cell model had changes in glycolysis, hypoxia, and NOTCH signaling, with 
more KRAS or TP53 mutations. Low-risk groups in the T cell model displayed 
stronger antitumor immune responses. Treatment predictions and nomograms were 
developed for clinical use.
CONCLUSIONS: scRNA-seq and DNAm data integration enabled the creation of 
predictive models based on epithelial and T cell-specific methylation patterns, 
offering robust prognosis prediction for PDAC patients.

BACKGROUND: Despite the advancements in early lung cancer detection attributed 
to the widespread use of low-dose computed tomography (LDCT), this technology 
has also led to an increasing number of pulmonary nodules (PNs) of indeterminate 
significance being identified. Therefore, this study was aimed to develop a 
model that leverages plasma methylation biomarkers and clinical characteristics 
to distinguish between malignant and benign PNs.
METHODS: In a training cohort of 210 patients with PNs, we evaluated plasma 
circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) for the presence of three lung cancer-specific 
methylation markers: SHOX2, SCT, and HOXA7. Subsequently, we constructed a 
combined model utilizing methylated SHOX2/SCT/HOXA7 (mSHOX2/SCT/HOXA7) ctDNA 
levels, the largest nodule size measured by LDCT, and age, employing the binary 
logistic regression algorithm. Furthermore, we compared the diagnostic 
performances of the combined model with the Mayo Clinic model and the single 
mSHOX2/SCT/HOXA7 model by analyzing the area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve (AUC) for each.
RESULTS: The combined model demonstrated an impressive AUC of 0.87 and an 
accuracy of 0.75 in the training cohort, using pathologic diagnoses as the gold 
standard. This performance was significantly superior to that of the single 
mSHOX2/SCT/HOXA7 panel (AUC = 0.81, P < 0.0001) and the Mayo model (AUC = 0.65, 
P = 0.0005). Further validation in a cohort of 82 patients with PNs confirmed 
the diagnostic value of the combined model. Additionally, we observed that as 
the size of the nodule increased, the diagnostic accuracy of the combined model 
also improved.
CONCLUSIONS: A combined model incorporating the ctDNA-based methylation status 
of SHOX2/SCT/HOXA7 genes, the largest nodule size measured by LDCT, and age can 
serve as a supplementary approach to LDCT for lung cancer. This model enhances 
the precision in identifying high-risk individuals and optimizes the clinical 
management strategies for PNs detected by CT.

BACKGROUND: Cell-free DNA (cfDNA), a broadly applicable biomarker commonly 
sourced from urine or blood, is extensively used for research and diagnostic 
applications. In various settings, genetic and epigenetic information is derived 
from cfDNA. However, a unified framework for its processing is lacking, limiting 
the universal application of innovative analysis strategies and the joining of 
data sets.
FINDINGS: Here, we describe cfDNA UniFlow, a unified, standardized, and 
ready-to-use workflow for processing cfDNA samples. The workflow is written in 
Snakemake and can be scaled from stand-alone computers to cluster environments. 
It includes methods for processing raw genome sequencing data as well as 
specialized approaches for correcting sequencing errors, filtering, and quality 
control. Sophisticated methods for detecting copy number alterations and 
estimating and correcting GC-related biases are readily incorporated. 
Furthermore, it includes methods for extracting, normalizing, and visualizing 
coverage signals around user-defined regions in case-control settings. 
Ultimately, all results and metrics are aggregated in a unified report, enabling 
easy access to a wide variety of information for further research and downstream 
analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: We provide an automated pipeline for processing cell-free DNA 
sampled from liquid biopsies, including a wide variety of additional 
functionalities like bias correction and signal extraction. With our focus on 
scalability and extensibility, we provide a foundation for future cfDNA research 
and faster clinical applications. The source code and extensive documentation 
are available on our GitHub repository

Cancers during oncogenic progression hold information in epigenetic memory which 
allows flexible encoding of malignant phenotypes and more rapid reaction to the 
environment when compared to purely mutation-based clonal evolution mechanisms. 
Cancer memory describes a proposed mechanism by which complex information such 
as metastasis phenotypes, therapy resistance and interaction patterns with the 
tumor environment might be encoded at multiple levels via mechanisms used in 
memory formation in the brain and immune system (e.g. single-cell epigenetic 
changes and distributed state modifications in cellular ensembles). 
Carcinogenesis might hence be the result of physiological multi-level learning 
mechanisms unleashed by defined heritable oncogenic changes which lead to 
tumor-specific loss of goal state integration into the whole organism. The 
formation of cancer memories would create and bind new levels of individuality 
within the host organism into the entity we call cancer. Translational 
implications of cancer memory are that cancers could be engaged at higher 
organizational levels (e.g. be ""trained"" for memory extinction) and that 
compounds that are known to interfere with memory processes could be 
investigated for their potential to block cancer memory formation or recall. It 
also suggests that diagnostic measures should extend beyond sequencing 
approaches to functional diagnosis of cancer physiology.

BACKGROUND: African American (AA) men are at increased risk of prostate cancer 
compared with European American (EA) men. Biological mechanisms, including 
epigenetics, likely contribute to this disparity, but prior studies have been 
limited by sample size, candidate gene approaches, or lack of epigenome-wide DNA 
methylation (DNAm) data.
METHODS: To improve our understanding of these mechanisms, we compared DNAm 
features distinguishing tumor and paired histologically benign tissue from 76 AA 
and 75 EA patients with prostate cancer. We generated genome-wide array-based 
DNAm data and conducted differential methylation analyses comparing tumor and 
benign tissues in each ancestry group. We then examined the predictive ability 
of our identified sites and differential methylation by ancestry group.
RESULTS: We identified 90,747 and 98,929 differentially methylated CpGs in AA 
and EA, respectively, with 76,400 common to both groups. We identified 6,267 
genes with differentially methylated promoters common to both ancestries and 639 
and 1,301 genes unique to AA and EA respectively, as well as differentially 
methylated pathways. Only 10 CpGs were needed to distinguish tumor from benign 
based on a receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC > 0.9), with 
differentially methylated CpGs in one ancestry accurately predicting tumor 
versus benign in the other group. We also identified ancestry-associated CpGs 
(89 in tumor, 423 in benign).
CONCLUSIONS: Methylation features distinguishing tumor and benign were similar 
for EA and AA men; however, subtle differences were identified.
IMPACT: Differences in tumor and ancestry-associated CpGs may reveal 
differential tumor growth strategies, an important area for future disparities 
research.

BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer (GC) remains a serious health concern and is 
characterized by a multifactorial etiology involving both genetic and epigenetic 
factors. The aim of the current study was to examine the relationship between 
Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-G 3'UTR polymorphisms and the expression of HLA-G 
in both tumor tissues and plasma samples from patients with GC in the Tunisian 
population.
METHODS: HLA-G 3'UTR polymorphisms (14pb Insertion/deletion and + 3142C/G) were 
identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or Sanger sequencing. Plasma 
levels of sHLA-G (total sHLA-G, shed HLA-G1 and HLA-G5) were determined. 
Immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate the expression of HLA-G in tumor 
tissues.
RESULTS: The Del/Del genotype and Del allele frequencies were different between 
GC patients and healthy donors (HD) (OR [95 % CI] = 2.483 [1.070-5.410], 
p = 0.025 vs. OR [95 % CI] = 1.537 [0.924-2.584], p = 0.099; respectively). The 
C/C genotype and C allele frequencies were significantly greater in GC patients 
than in HD (OR [95 % CI] = 2.269[0.1.070-4.904], p = 0.033 vs. OR [95 % 
CI] = 1.746[1.045-2.878], p = 0.034; respectively). Interestingly, the Del/Del 
genotype and Del allele were significantly associated with an increased risk of 
GC in patients aged ≥55 years at diagnosis. HLA-G was highly expressed in GC 
tissues, particularly in tissues with advanced tumor invasion (T3 + T4). 
Compared with HD, GC patients had higher soluble HLA-G, shed HLA-G1 and HLA-G5 
levels (Mann-Whitney: p = 0.001, p = 0.001 and p = 0.643, respectively). 
Assessment of patients' survival by Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that the Del 
allele was significantly associated with reduced overall survival (OS) in GC 
patients at advanced stages III + IV (p = 0.043).
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that HLA-G 3'UTR polymorphisms are associated 
with GC susceptibility in Tunisian population. The expression of HLA-G in both 
the tissue and plasma may play an important role in the development and 
progression of GC. Therefore, the current study supported the recommendation of 
investigating HLA-G 3'UTR polymorphisms in GC and indicated that HLA-G molecules 
could serve as promising therapeutic targets in GC.

High-risk HPV (hrHPV)-based screening has led to many unnecessary colposcopy 
referrals, mainly because of direct referral after low-grade cytology 
(ASC-US/LSIL). DNA methylation and genotyping tests on ASC-US/LSIL samples have 
the potential to significantly improve the efficiency of screening. In this 
study, 12 triage strategies were constructed from FAM19A4/miR124-2 or ASCL1/LHX8 
methylation, HPV16/18 or HPV16/18/31/33/45 genotyping and 1-year repeat 
cytology. The performance was evaluated on 215 hrHPV-positive ASC-US/LSIL 
samples from the IMPROVE trial (NTR5078). Performance was measured by colposcopy 
referral rate, positive predictive value (PPV) for detecting precancer (CIN3), 
and negative predictive value (NPV). To evaluate efficiency, strategies were 
ordered by the cumulative colposcopy referral rate after 1-year cytology and 
compared by the marginal PPV to detect one additional CIN3 (mPPV). The most 
conservative strategy (referral when HPV16/18 and FAM19A4/miR124 methylation 
results are positive) had a direct referral rate of 5.2%, a cumulative referral 
rate after 1-year cytology of 54.1%, and mPPV of 19.3%. Replacing HPV16/18 by 
HPV16/18/31/33/45 increased the cumulative 1-year referral rate to 54.6%, and 
yielded an mPPV of 10.0%. Similar results were obtained for strategies with 
ASCL1/LHX8 methylation. Of all strategies, referral after an HPV16/18/31/33/45 
positive, ASCL1/LHX8 methylation-positive, and/or 1-year cytology-positive 
result yielded the highest direct and cumulative 1-year colposcopy referral 
rates of 64.4% and 79.1%, respectively. The NPVs after 1-year cytology varied 
between 98.1% and 99.4%, warranting a return to routine screening. Altogether, 
DNA methylation-based triage strategies are recommended as they are 
discriminative for CIN3 and control the number of immediate colposcopy 
referrals.

BACKGROUND: Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is a heterogeneous tumor characterized by 
diverse genetic and molecular alterations. Developing a multi-omics-based 
classification system for LUAD is urgently needed to advance biological 
understanding.
METHODS: Data on clinical and pathological characteristics, genetic alterations, 
DNA methylation patterns, and the expression of mRNA, lncRNA, and microRNA, 
along with somatic mutations in LUAD patients, were gathered from the TCGA and 
GEO datasets. A computational workflow was utilized to merge multi-omics data 
from LUAD patients through 10 clustering techniques, which were paired with 10 
machine learning methods to pinpoint detailed molecular subgroups and refine a 
prognostic risk model. The disparities in somatic mutations, copy number 
alterations, and immune cell infiltration between high- and low-risk groups were 
assessed. The effectiveness of immunotherapy in patients was evaluated through 
the TIDE and SubMap algorithms, supplemented by data from various immunotherapy 
groups. Furthermore, the Cancer Therapeutics Response Portal (CTRP) and the 
PRISM Repurposing dataset (PRISM) were employed to investigate new drug 
treatment approaches for LUAD. In the end, the role of SLC2A1 in tumor dynamics 
was examined using RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, CCK-8, wound healing, and 
transwell tests.
RESULTS: By employing multi-omics clustering, we discovered two unique cancer 
subtypes (CSs) linked to prognosis, with CS2 demonstrating a better outcome. A 
strong model made up of 17 genes was created using a random survival forest 
(RSF) method, which turned out to be an independent predictor of overall 
survival and showed reliable and impressive performance. The low-risk group not 
only had a better prognosis but also was more likely to display the ""cold tumor"" 
phenotype. On the other hand, individuals in the high-risk group showed a worse 
outlook and were more likely to respond positively to immunotherapy and six 
particular chemotherapy medications. Laboratory cell tests demonstrated that 
SLC2A1 is abundantly present in LUAD tissues and cells, greatly enhancing the 
proliferation and movement of LUAD cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Thorough examination of multi-omics data offers vital understanding 
and improves the molecular categorization of LUAD. Utilizing a powerful machine 
learning system, we highlight the immense potential of the riskscore in 
providing individualized risk evaluations and customized treatment suggestions 
for LUAD patients.

Lung cancer is one of the most common cancers in humans. However, there is still 
a need to understand the underlying mechanisms of a normal cell developing into 
a cancer cell. Here, we develop the chromosome dynamic structural model and 
quantify the important characteristics of the chromosome structural ensemble of 
the normal lung cell and the lung cancer A549 cell. Our results demonstrate the 
essential relationship among the chromosome ensemble, the epigenetic marks, and 
the gene expressions, which suggests the linkage between chromosome structure 
and function. The analysis reveals that the lung cancer cell may have a higher 
level of relative ensemble fluctuation (micro CFI) and a higher degree of phase 
separation between the two compartments than the normal lung cell. In addition, 
the significant conformational ""switching off"" events (from compartment A to B) 
are more than the significant conformational ""switching on"" events during the 
lung cancerization. We identify ""nucleation seeds"" or hot spots in chromosomes, 
which initiate the transitions and determine the mechanisms. The hot spots and 
interaction network results reveal that the lung cancerization process (from 
normal lung to A549) and the reversion process have different mechanisms. These 
investigations have revealed the cell fate determination mechanism of the lung 
cancer process, which will be helpful for the further prevention and control of 
cancers.

Epigenetic clocks can quantify DNA methylation by measuring the methylation 
levels at specific sites in the genome, which correlate with biological age 
(BA). Accelerated aging, where BA exceeds chronologic age, has been studied in 
relation to cancer development, but its utility in cancer prevention remains 
unclear. Accelerated aging holds promise as a tool to explain the increase in 
early-onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC). We investigate the association of 
accelerated aging and the presence of preneoplastic polyps (PNP) in the colon, 
defined as tubular adenomas and sessile serrated adenomas. In this study of 
persons under age 50 undergoing colonoscopy, we used peripheral blood samples to 
determine BA and age acceleration metrics. Age acceleration was determined by 
interrogating DNA methylation at specific CpG sites across the genome, which has 
been shown to correlate with age. We then conducted logistic regression analyses 
to evaluate the association between age acceleration and PNPs. In total, 51 
patient samples were evaluated. We found that that the odds of harboring a PNP 
are 16% higher with 1 year of accelerated aging, as measured by GrimAge. 
However, the strongest risk factor for PNPs remained male sex. This represents 
one of the first studies to explore accelerated aging and PNP in patients under 
the age of 50. A risk-stratified approach to EOCRC screening would minimize 
unnecessary colonoscopies and minimize healthcare burden while addressing the 
increase in EOCRC. Our findings suggest that BA calculations with peripheral 
blood collections could be an important component of such a risk model. 
Prevention Relevance: Understanding the association of accelerated aging and 
colorectal PNPs presents an opportunity to develop a risk-stratified approach to 
colorectal cancer screening in young persons.

BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is a pathology with an important incidence. It is a 
multifactorial disease characterized by epigenetic and nutritional factors. 
Indeed, there is a strong association between adipose tissue and the pulmonary 
system, and low-grade inflammation of obese and/or overweight subjects have a 
pivotal role in lung cancer establishment.
METHODS: In this study, we analyzed body composition through bioelectrical 
impedance analysis (BIA) and biochemical parameters such as glycemic and lipidic 
profile, inflammation profile and adiponectin serum levels in 30 patients (19 
male; 11 women) undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) lobectomy 
for lung cancer from September 2021 to May 2022 at the Thoracic Unit of Luigi 
Vanvitelli University of Naples. A control group were also recruited (15 male; 
15 female) consisting of age and sex matched volunteered subjects at the 
Thoracic Unit of Luigi Vanvitelli University of Naples. The control group and 
lung cancer patients were monitored for anthropometric and biochemical 
parameters before VATS lobectomy. Furthermore, the lung cancer patients were 
also monitored after 6 months of surgery.
RESULTS: Body composition is modified after surgery and also albumin and 
C-reactive protein (CRP) serum levels. In the overweight patients in our study, 
adiponectin levels were found to be reduced compared with the control group and 
increased in the same patients after VATS lobectomy.
CONCLUSIONS: Tumor removal as well as weight loss could affect adiponectin 
levels, and thus also a reduction in inflammation. In addition, weight loss 
could also be due to a psychological condition given by the intervention and not 
to malnutrition related to therapy.

BACKGROUND: DNA methylation (DNAm)-based marker of aging, referred to as 
'epigenetic age' or 'DNAm age' is a highly accurate multi-tissue biomarker for 
aging, associated with age-related disease risk, including cancer. Breast cancer 
(BC), an age-associated disease, is associated with older DNAm age and 
epigenetic age acceleration (age accel) at tissue levels. But this raises a 
question on the predictability of DNAm age/age accel in BC development, 
emphasizing the importance of studying DNAm age in pre-diagnostic peripheral 
blood (PB) in BC etiology and prevention.
METHODS: We included postmenopausal women from the largest study cohort and 
prospectively investigated BC development with their pre-diagnostic DNAm in PB 
leukocytes (PBLs). We estimated Horvath's pan-tissue DNAm age and investigated 
whether DNAm age/age accel highly correlates with risk for developing 
subtype-specific BC and to what degree the risk is modified by hormones and 
lifestyle factors.
RESULTS: DNAm age in PBLs was tightly correlated with age in this age range, and 
older DNAm age and epigenetic age accel were significantly associated with risk 
for developing overall BC and luminal subtypes. Of note, in women with bilateral 
oophorectomy before natural menopause experiencing shorter lifetime estrogen 
exposure than those with natural menopause, epigenetic age accel substantially 
influenced BC development, independent of obesity status and exogeneous estrogen 
use.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings contribute to better understanding of biologic aging 
processes that mediate BC carcinogenesis, detecting a non-invasive epigenetic 
aging marker that better reflects BC development, and ultimately identifying the 
elderly with high risk who can benefit from epigenetically targeted preventive 
interventions.

BACKGROUND: Ductal carcinoma in-situ (DCIS) is a pre-invasive form of invasive 
breast cancer (IBC). Due to improved breast cancer screening, it now accounts 
for ~ 25% of all breast cancers. While the treatment success rates are over 90%, 
this comes at the cost of considerable morbidity, considering that the majority 
of DCIS never become invasive and our understanding of the molecular changes 
occurring in DCIS that predispose to invasive disease is limited. The aim of 
this study is to characterize molecular changes that occur in DCIS, with the 
goal of improving DCIS risk stratification.
METHODS: We identified and obtained a total of 197 breast tissue samples from 5 
institutions (93 DCIS progressors, 93 DCIS non-progressors, and 11 adjacent 
normal breast tissues) that had at least 10-year follow-up. We isolated DNA and 
RNA from archival tissue blocks and characterized genome-wide mRNA expression, 
DNA methylation, DNA copy number variation, and RNA splicing variation.
RESULTS: We obtained all four genomic data sets in 122 of the 197 samples. Our 
intrinsic expression subtype-stratified analyses identified multiple molecular 
differences both between DCIS subtypes and between DCIS and IBC. While there was 
heterogeneity in molecular signatures and outcomes within intrinsic subtypes, 
several gene sets that differed significantly between progressing and 
non-progressing DCIS were identified by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis.
CONCLUSION: DCIS is a molecularly highly heterogenous disease with variable 
outcomes, and the molecular events determining DCIS disease progression remain 
poorly defined. Our genome-wide multi-omic survey documents DCIS-associated 
alterations and reveals molecular heterogeneity within the intrinsic DCIS 
subtypes. Further studies investigating intrinsic subtype-stratified 
characteristics and molecular signatures are needed to determine if these may be 
exploitable for risk assessment and mitigation of DCIS progression. The highly 
significant associations of specific gene sets with IBC progression revealed by 
our Gene Set Enrichment Analysis may lend themselves to the development of a 
prognostic molecular score, to be validated on independent DCIS cohorts.

Ageing is associated with a decline in the number and fitness of adult stem 
cells1,2. Ageing-associated loss of stemness is posited to suppress 
tumorigenesis3,4, but this hypothesis has not been tested in vivo. Here we use 
physiologically aged autochthonous genetically engineered5,6 mouse models and 
primary cells5,6 to demonstrate that ageing suppresses lung cancer initiation 
and progression by degrading the stemness of the alveolar cell of origin. This 
phenotype is underpinned by the ageing-associated induction of the transcription 
factor NUPR1 and its downstream target lipocalin-2 in the cell of origin in mice 
and humans, which leads to functional iron insufficiency in the aged cells. 
Genetic inactivation of the NUPR1-lipocalin-2 axis or iron supplementation 
rescues stemness and promotes the tumorigenic potential of aged alveolar cells. 
Conversely, targeting the NUPR1-lipocalin-2 axis is detrimental to young 
alveolar cells through ferroptosis induction. Ageing-associated DNA 
hypomethylation at specific enhancer sites is associated with increased NUPR1 
expression, which is recapitulated in young alveolar cells through DNA 
methylation inhibition. We uncover that ageing drives functional iron 
insufficiency that leads to loss of stemness and tumorigenesis but promotes 
resistance to ferroptosis. These findings have implications for the therapeutic 
modulation of cellular iron homeostasis in regenerative medicine and in cancer 
prevention. Furthermore, our findings are consistent with a model whereby most 
human cancers initiate at a young age, thereby highlighting the importance of 
directing cancer prevention efforts towards young individuals.

DNMT3A and TET2 are epigenetic regulator genes commonly mutated in age-related 
clonal hematopoiesis (CH). Despite having opposed epigenetic functions, these 
mutations are associated with increased all-cause mortality and a low risk for 
progression to hematologic neoplasms. Although individual impacts on the 
epigenome have been described using different model systems, the phenotypic 
complexity in humans remains to be elucidated. Here, we make use of a natural 
inflammatory response occurring during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), to 
understand the association of these mutations with inflammatory morbidity (acute 
respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS]) and mortality. We demonstrate the 
age-independent, negative impact of DNMT3A mutant (DNMT3Amt) CH on 
COVID-19-related ARDS and mortality. Using single-cell proteogenomics we show 
that DNMT3A mutations involve myeloid and lymphoid lineage cells. Using 
single-cell multiomics sequencing, we identify cell-specific gene expression 
changes associated with DNMT3A mutations, along with significant epigenomic 
deregulation affecting enhancer accessibility, resulting in overexpression of 
interleukin-32 (IL-32), a proinflammatory cytokine that can result in 
inflammasome activation in monocytes and macrophages. Finally, we show with 
single-cell resolution that the loss of function of DNMT3A is directly 
associated with increased chromatin accessibility in mutant cells. Hence, we 
demonstrate the negative prognostic impact of DNMT3Amt CH on COVID-19-related 
ARDS and mortality. DNMT3Amt CH in the context of COVID-19, was associated with 
inflammatory transcriptional priming, resulting in overexpression of IL32. This 
overexpression was secondary to increased chromatic accessibility, specific to 
DNMT3Amt CH cells. DNMT3Amt CH can thus serve as a potential biomarker for 
adverse outcomes in COVID-19.

BACKGROUND: Epigenetic modifications are crucial in tumourigenesis, yet the 
changes in novel epigenetic regulators like 5-hydroxymethylcytosines (5hmC) 
during the evolution of gastric premalignant lesions remain poorly understood. 
This study aims to investigate the implications of 5hmC in the progression from 
gastric premalignant lesions to gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC).
METHODS: To our knowledge, we conducted the largest and longest longitudinal 
study of a Chinese population with gastric precursor lesions, involving 29,176 
patients with gastritis who underwent gastroscopy and biopsy between 2001 and 
2015, with follow-up until 1 August, 2022. The median follow-up time was 12.2 
years, and the overall GAC incidence rate was 0.82%. Genome-wide mapping of 5hmC 
in gastric premalignant lesions from a subset of individuals was performed using 
the 5hmC-Seal assay, including 21 samples that progressed to GAC during 
follow-up and 48 non-progressed age- and sex-matched controls.
RESULTS: We identified 213 differentially modified gene bodies, primarily 
concentrated in pathways related to cell division, cell cycle, energy 
metabolism, inflammation and tumourigenesis. An exploratory study was conducted 
to summarize a 5hmC-based epigenetic model for predicting cancer progression 
using multivariable logistic regression and machine learning. The nine-gene 
model showed an area under the curve of 87.5% (95% confidence interval: 
72%-100%) in the validation samples (one of three), which were set aside before 
model training.
CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to explore the 5hmC molecular landscape in 
gastric premalignant lesions, suggesting relevant pathways implicated in their 
evolution to GAC as well as the feasibility of exploiting genome-wide 5hmC 
mapping in assessing the risk of future cancer progression.
KEY POINTS: A largest longitudinal follow-up study of gastric precursor lesions 
in Chinese patients. Revealing novel 5hmC molecular landscape linked to gastric 
premalignant lesions. The feasibility of an innovative 5hmC-based predictive 
model for assessing gastric cancer progression risk.

Smoking-associated epigenetic changes have been linked to lung cancer (LC) risk; 
however, the role of epigenetic alterations independent of smoking is yet to be 
fully understood. This study aimed to validate 16 previously reported CpG sites 
that are independent of smoking yet associated with LC risk within a 
population-based prospective cohort. Using the Infinium Methylation EPIC 
BeadChip kit or the Infinium HumanMethylation450K BeadChip Assay, DNA 
methylation (DNAm) in whole blood was assessed in four subsets (n = 736, 1027, 
997, and 312) of a population-based cohort from Germany. The DNAm levels of the 
16 smoking-independent CpG sites were analyzed. Hazard ratios (HRs) and their 
95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated to assess associations of 
DNAm at the 16 CpG sites with LC risk, adjusting for multiple covariates, 
including smoking habits and a smoking-associated DNAm score. Over 17 years of 
follow-up, a total of 199 LCs were observed. Among the 16 CpGs, cg02211449 
showed a negative association with LC risk (HR [95% CI] per SD increase, = 0.70 
[0.63-0.78]), while cg11385536 (1.04 [1.01-1.07]), cg09736286 (1.64 
[1.10-2.44]), cg19907023 (1.64 [1.01-2.66]), and cg22032485 (1.52 [1.04-2.21]) 
displayed positive associations with LC risk. Five of the 16 suggested 
smoking-independent CpGs could be externally validated as predictors of LC risk. 
Further research should address their potential contribution to enhanced LC risk 
stratification.

Colon cancer typically affects older adults, though it can happen at any age. 
Colon cancer, also known as Caco-2, is caused by multiple epigenetic alterations 
and involves unregulated proliferation, differentiation, and invasion of 
neighboring tissues. Colon cancer patients have had surgery, radiation, hormone 
therapy, and chemotherapy. This study investigates a new experimental method 
using inexpensive and environmentally friendly Egyptian plant extracts. 
DMSO-dissolved ginger, garlic, cinnamon, and chamomile were employed in this 
investigation. HPLC and GC-MS were used to analyze plant extracts. These 
extracts were tested for colon cancer efficacy using various methods. These 
methods included Caco-2 cells, MTT test, Annexin V-FITC flow cytometry, qRT-PCR, 
and ELISA. Garlic and ginger were found to be cytotoxic to Caco-2 cells. 
Compared to cinnamon and chamomile extracts, garlic and ginger have boosted LDH 
synthesis significantly. Garlic and ginger also altered autophagy genes 
(Bectin1, Atg5, PTEN) and Caspase-3 expression pathways on proapoptotic 
signaling. Garlic and ginger increased cleaved PTEN and caspase-3 and decreased 
Atg5 and Bectin1. Ginger and garlic caused extrinsic apoptosis and prevented 
Atg5 and Bectin1 phosphorylation. The average IL-8 and IL-6 levels increased 
significantly after 24 hours, according to ELISA. In conclusion, garlic and 
ginger extracts modify pro-inflammatory cytokines. Alternative herbal remedies 
like garlic and ginger may be effective and safe colon cancer treatments.

BACKGROUND: Effective screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) enables earlier 
diagnosis and intervention to improve patient survival.
METHODS: In this study, we prospectively conducted a blood-based CRC screening 
program for community residents in Hanjiang District, Yangzhou City, and 
evaluated the screening efficacy of a blood-based multi-locus DNA methylation 
assay (ColonAiQ). The ColonAiQ-positive rate and colonoscopy participation rate 
of the population, detection rate of intestinal lesions, and positive predictive 
value (PPV) of CRC and advanced adenoma (AA) were calculated, and the associated 
factors were explored.
RESULTS: A total of 105,285 participants were enrolled from January 2021 to 
December 2022, all of whom completed the ColonAiQ assay, yielding a positive 
rate of 6.42% (6759/105,285). The colonoscopy compliance rate was 48.56% 
(3282/6759). Intestinal lesions were detected in 1773 individuals (54.02%), 
including 63 cases of CRCs (predominately early-stage), 1195 adenomas (441 cases 
of AAs), 327 polyps, and 188 other benign lesions. CRC patients exhibited higher 
ColonAiQ scores and more positive loci compared to healthy individuals. The PPVs 
were 1.92% for CRC and 13.44% for AA. Among participants, 66,121 (62.8%) 
completed questionnaires graded by the Asia-Pacific Colorectal Screening score, 
with 12,139 (18.36%) classified in the high-risk tier. High-risk participants 
had a higher ColonAiQ-positive rate (11.07%) and PPVs for CRC (3.46%) and AA 
(22.18%). Factors associated with increased detection rates for CRC and AA 
included male gender, older age, a history of alcohol consumption, and prior 
polyps.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that ColonAiQ assay effectively identifies 
high-risk population. These findings strongly suggest that the ColonAiQ assay 
represents a promising strategy for the early detection of CRC and AA in 
individuals at average risk.

OBJECTIVE: DNA methylation is a promising biomarker for cervical cancer 
screening. This study aimed to validate the triage performance of cytological 
DNA methylation for detecting cervical intraepithelial neoplasia of grade 3 or 
worse (CIN3+) in women with high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) infection 
from a large prospective cohort undergoing opportunistic screening in China 
(METHY3).
METHODS: The triage performance for detecting CIN3+ lesions was compared between 
HPV16/18 genotyping, a liquid-based cytology (LBC) test, and the PAX1 and JAM3 
methylation (PAX1m/JAM3m) test according to cervical pathologic outcomes. Among 
the 4394 women infected with hrHPV, 1105 had definitive cervical histological 
findings that were analyzed.
RESULTS: For detecting CIN3+, the specificity of HPV16/18(+), the LBC result of 
≥atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS), and 
PAX1m/JAM3m(+) was 66.4%, 23.9%, and 89.6%, respectively, with odds ratios of 
4.24 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.85-6.40), 4.44 (2.27-10.1), and 18.5 
(12.1-28.7) (P < .001), respectively. PAX1m/JAM3m(+) had the highest area under 
the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.790, 95% CI, 0.747-0.832) in the 
whole cohort and in women of various ages. PAX1m/JAM3m (+) was detected in all 
patients with cancer (n = 28). Compared with HPV16/18 genotyping and the LBC 
test, PAX1m/JAM3m testing reduced referrals to colposcopy by 20.64 percentage 
points and 61.18 percentage points, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: PAX1 m /JAM3 m testing is highly specific for detecting CIN3+. As a 
triage biomarker, it is superior to HPV 16/18 genotyping and LBC testing for 
women with hrHPV infection.

The tumor microenvironment and immune evasion function in a complex cellular 
network profoundly challenge the clinical outcome of promising therapies. Our 
recently published study reported that the subset of genes upregulated in ccRCC 
due to H3K4me1 and DNA demethylation potentially leads to an immunosuppressive 
environment. Thus, modulating H3K4me1 chromatin modifier SETD7 with a natural 
inhibitor in combination with immunotherapy might improve the immune landscape 
for a better therapeutic outcome. The present study was conducted via virtual 
screening and MD simulation using compounds from the literature, IMPPAT, and 
SuperNatural database. The phytochemical IMPHY002979 showed better binding 
affinity and lower energy than the reported R-PFI-2 and cyproheptadine 
inhibitors. The phytochemicals interact with the SET domain through H-bonding, 
as confirmed by MD simulation and molecular interaction analysis. Further, the 
compound was assessed using ADME parameters and free energy estimation, showing 
better pharmacokinetic properties. Therefore, the non-accessibility of the 
histone methyltransferase activity domain of SET7 with IMPHY002979 can 
downregulate H3K4me1 and, thereby, the expression of genes potentially 
responsible for immunosuppressive TME. Thus, patient stratification based on 
molecular markers for immunotherapy and combining epigenetic modulators with 
therapeutic drugs will improve the efficacy of immunotherapy in ccRCC.

The lifestyle patterns of top athletes are highly disciplined, featuring strict 
exercise regimens, nutrition plans, and mental preparation, often beginning at a 
young age. Recently, it was shown that physically active individuals exhibit 
slowed epigenetic aging and better age-related outcomes. Here, we investigate 
whether the extreme intensity of physical activity of Olympic champions still 
has a beneficial effect on epigenetic aging. To test this hypothesis, we 
examined the epigenetic aging of 59 Hungarian Olympic champions and of the 332 
control subjects, 205 were master rowers. We observed that Olympic champions 
exhibit slower epigenetic aging, applying seven state-of-the-art epigenetic 
aging clocks. Additionally, male champions who won any medal within the last 
10 years showed slower epigenetic aging compared to other male champions, while 
female champions exhibited the opposite trend. We also found that wrestlers had 
higher age acceleration compared to gymnasts, fencers, and water polo players. 
We identified the top 20 genes that showed the most remarkable difference in 
promoter methylation between Olympic champions and non-champions. The 
hypo-methylated genes are involved in synaptic health, glycosylation, metal ion 
membrane transfer, and force generation. Most of the hyper-methylated genes were 
associated with cancer promotion. The data suggest that rigorous and long-term 
exercise from adolescence to adulthood has beneficial effects on epigenetic 
aging.

Long interspersed nuclear elements 1 (LINE-1) are the most abundant and the only 
autonomous mobile elements in the human genome. When their epigenetic repression 
is removed, it can lead to disease, such as autoimmune diseases and cancer. 
Coeliac disease (CeD) is an immune-mediated disease triggered by an abnormal 
T-cell response to dietary gluten and a predisposing condition of small bowel 
adenocarcinoma (SBA), frequently characterized by epigenetic alterations. The 
aim of this work was to assess LINE-1 methylation by bisulphite pyrosequencing 
and NanoString® gene transcription analysis in 38 CeD-SBAs compared with 25 SBAs 
associated with Crohn's disease (CrD-SBAs) and 25 sporadic SBAs (S-SBA). Both 
analyses were also performed in duodenal mucosae from 12 untreated CeD patients 
(UCD) and 19 treated CeD patients (TCD), and in 11 samples of normal intestinal 
mucosa to better investigate the role of LINE-1 deregulation in CeD and in 
CeD-SBA. A significant loss of LINE-1 methylation was observed in CeD-SBAs and 
in mucosae from UCD patients (with very similar methylation levels) compared 
with controls. By contrast, a restoration of normal LINE-1 methylation levels 
was found in TCD mucosae after a strict gluten-free diet. LINE-1 hypomethylation 
does not lead to expression of ORF1 and ORF2, with the only exception being for 
one CeD-SBA. The expression analysis of enzymes modulating DNA methylation and 
inflammatory genes confirmed that CeD-SBA shared a very similar expression 
profile of UCD mucosae showing a strong upregulation of genes involved in 
inflammation, immune response, and T-cell activity compared with TCD mucosae. 
For the first time, this work demonstrates that loss of DNA methylation is an 
intrinsic epigenetic feature of CeD, accompanying the immune response as a 
reversible mechanism in patients following a strict gluten-free diet, and 
suggests the possible role of LINE-1 hypomethylation in promoting cell 
adaptability during the gliadin-related inflammatory process. © 2024 The

Penile cancer is an uncommon disease compared with other urological tumors and 
is more common in low- and middle-income countries. Risk factors include age, 
ethnicity, smoking, hygiene, and human papillomavirus infection. Although 
carcinoma of the penis can be cured in up to 80% of cases if detected early, 
late diagnosis drastically reduces survival rates, especially in metastatic 
cases. More than 95% of cases are squamous cell carcinomas, and the degree of 
cell differentiation is a key histopathological factor, distinguishing between 
poorly (P), moderately (M), and well-differentiated (W) carcinomas, with 
verrucous carcinoma (V) having the best prognosis due to its low metastatic 
capacity. This study analyses the differential expression of several biomarkers 
related to cell proliferation and cell cycle, inflammation, epigenetics, and 
autophagy (cell cycle (IRS-4, Ki-67, RB1, CDK4, cyclin D1, ERBB2, β-catenin, and 
MAGE-A), inflammation (COX2, NLRP3, and AIF-1), epigenetics (HAT-1) and 
autophagy (ULK-1 and ATG9A) in penile carcinoma according to the degree of 
differentiation. Immunohistochemical techniques were performed on 34 penile 
squamous cell carcinoma (PSCC) samples classified into subtype V (N=6), and 
groups P (N=9), M (N=9), and W (N=10). The findings suggest a differential 
expression of molecules according to the degree of cell differentiation, with a 
higher differential expression of molecules according to the degree of cell 
differentiation, suggesting that the proteins studied could have predictive 
value. The study highlights the complexity of PSCC and the need for future 
studies to explore translational applications and search for new biomarkers to 
improve clinical management and understanding of this disease.

WDFY4 plays an essential role in the immune system by regulating B-cell growth 
and development and participating in antigen processing during 
cross-presentation. WDFY4 is closely related to asthma and systemic lupus 
erythematosus; however, its role in cancer remains unclear. The purpose of this 
study is to use bioinformatics to determine whether abnormal expression of WDFY4 
is a risk factor for cancer and to preliminarily analyze the ways in which WDFY4 
affects cancer through experiments. R language packages and bioinformatic 
database were used to mine the potential carcinogenic effect of WDFY4 and 
analyze the differential WDFY4 expression in cancer, gene mutations, different 
tumor prognoses, immune cell infiltration, tumor microenvironment, and DNA 
methylation correlation. H1975 and A549 cell lines were infected with 
lentiviruses to overexpress WDFY4, and the effect of WDFY4 on the activity, 
proliferation, apoptosis, and cell cycle of lung cancer cells was analyzed. 
WDFY4 was differentially expressed in human tumors in unpaired and paired 
samples. The differential expression of WDFY4 in unpaired and paired or protein 
samples from the Clinical Proteome Tumor Analysis Consortium of eight cancers 
was consistent. WDFY4 methylation was downregulated in 17 cancer types and 
caused prognostic differences in different directions in some cancers. WDFY4 
overexpression significantly inhibited the activity and proliferation of lung 
cancer cell lines, promoted apoptosis, and caused cell cycle arrest. 
Differential WDFY4 expression in cancers leads to differences in the prognosis 
of various cancers. WDFY4 can be an independent prognostic factor for glioma, 
KIRC, and LUSC.

Hepatoblastoma is the most common primary liver cancer in children. Poor 
outcomes are primarily associated with patients who have distant metastases. 
Using the Mammalian Metabolic Enzyme Database, we investigated the 
overexpression of metabolic enzymes in hepatoblastoma tumors compared to 
noncancerous liver tissue in the GSE131329 transcriptome dataset. For the 
overexpressed enzymes, we applied ElasticNet machine learning to assess their 
predictive value for metastasis. A metabolic expression score was then computed 
from the significant enzymes and integrated into a clinical-biological logistic 
regression model. Forty-one overexpressed enzymes distinguished hepatoblastoma 
tumors from noncancerous liver tissues. Eighteen of these enzymes predicted 
metastasis status with an AUC of 0.90, demonstrating 85.7% sensitivity and 92.3% 
specificity. ElasticNet machine learning identified DNMT3B and PFKFB4 as key 
predictors of metastasis. Univariate analyses confirmed the significance of 
these enzymes, with respective p-values of 0.0058 and 0.0091. A metabolic score 
based on DNMT3B and PFKFB4 expression discriminated metastasis status and 
high-risk CHIC scores (p-value = 0.005). The metabolic score was more sensitive 
than the C1/C2 classifier in predicting metastasis (accuracy: 0.72 vs. 0.55). In 
a regression model integrating the metabolic score with epidemiological 
parameters (gender, age at diagnosis, histological type, and clinical PRETEXT 
stage), the metabolic score was confirmed as an independent adverse predictor of 
metastasis (p-value = 0.003, odds ratio: 2.12). This study identified the dual 
overexpression of PFKFB4 and DNMT3B in hepatoblastoma patients at risk of 
metastasis (high-risk CHIC classification). The combined tumor expression of 
DNMT3B and PFKFB4 was used to compute a metabolic score, which was validated as 
an independent predictor of metastatic status in hepatoblastoma.

Biological mechanisms related to cancer development can leave distinct molecular 
fingerprints in tumours. By leveraging multi-omics and epidemiological 
information, we can unveil relationships between carcinogenesis processes that 
would otherwise remain hidden. Our integrative analysis of DNA methylome, 
transcriptome, and somatic mutation profiles of kidney tumours linked ageing, 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and xenobiotic metabolism to kidney 
carcinogenesis. Ageing process was represented by associations with cellular 
mitotic clocks such as epiTOC2, SBS1, telomere length, and PBRM1 and SETD2 
mutations, which ticked faster as tumours progressed. We identified a 
relationship between BAP1 driver mutations and the epigenetic upregulation of 
EMT genes (IL20RB and WT1), correlating with increased tumour immune 
infiltration, advanced stage, and poorer patient survival. We also observed an 
interaction between epigenetic silencing of the xenobiotic metabolism gene GSTP1 
and tobacco use, suggesting a link to genotoxic effects and impaired xenobiotic 
metabolism. Our pan-cancer analysis showed these relationships in other tumour 
types. Our study enhances the understanding of kidney carcinogenesis and its 
relation to risk factors and progression, with implications for other tumour 
types.

BACKGROUND: Transportation noise has been linked with breast cancer, but 
existing literature is conflicting. One proposed mechanism is that 
transportation noise disrupts sleep and the circadian rhythm. We investigated 
the relationships between road traffic noise, DNA methylation in circadian 
rhythm genes, and breast cancer. We selected 610 female participants (318 breast 
cancer cases and 292 controls) enrolled into the Malmö, Diet, and Cancer cohort. 
DNA methylation of CpGs (N = 29) in regulatory regions of circadian rhythm genes 
(CRY1, BMAL1, CLOCK, and PER1) was assessed by pyrosequencing of DNA from 
lymphocytes collected at enrollment. To assess associations between modeled 
5-year mean residential road traffic noise and differentially methylated CpG 
positions, we used linear regression models adjusting for potential confounders, 
including sociodemographics, shiftwork, and air pollution. Linear mixed effects 
models were used to evaluate road traffic noise and differentially methylated 
regions. Unconditional logistic regression was used to investigate CpG 
methylation and breast cancer.
RESULTS: We found that higher mean road traffic noise was associated with lower 
DNA methylation of three CRY1 CpGs (CpG1, CpG2, and CpG12) and three BMAL1 CpGs 
(CpG2, CpG6, and CpG7). Road traffic noise was also associated with differential 
methylation of CRY1 and BMAL1 promoters. In CRY1 CpG2 and CpG5 and in CLOCK 
CpG1, increasing levels of methylation tended to be associated with lower odds 
of breast cancer, with odds ratios (OR) of 0.88 (95% confidence interval (CI) 
0.76-1.02), 0.84 (95% CI 0.74-0.96), and 0.80 (95% CI 0.68-0.94), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our data suggest that DNA hypomethylation in CRY1 and 
BMAL1 could be part of a causal chain from road traffic noise to breast cancer. 
This is consistent with the hypothesis that disruption of the circadian rhythm, 
e.g., from road traffic noise exposure, increases the risk of breast cancer. 
Since no prior studies have explored this association, it is essential to 
replicate our results.

Aging is the greatest risk factor for breast cancer; however, how age-related 
cellular and molecular events impact cancer initiation is unknown. In this 
study, we investigated how aging rewires transcriptomic and epigenomic programs 
of mouse mammary glands at single-cell resolution, yielding a comprehensive 
resource for aging and cancer biology. Aged epithelial cells exhibit epigenetic 
and transcriptional changes in metabolic, pro-inflammatory and cancer-associated 
genes. Aged stromal cells downregulate fibroblast marker genes and upregulate 
markers of senescence and cancer-associated fibroblasts. Among immune cells, 
distinct T cell subsets (Gzmk+, memory CD4+, γδ) and M2-like macrophages expand 
with age. Spatial transcriptomics reveals co-localization of aged immune and 
epithelial cells in situ. Lastly, we found transcriptional signatures of aging 
mammary cells in human breast tumors, suggesting possible links between aging 
and cancer. Together, these data uncover that epithelial, immune and stromal 
cells shift in proportions and cell identity, potentially impacting cell 
plasticity, aged microenvironment and neoplasia risk.

Breast cancer (BC) is yet a significant global health challenge across various 
populations including Ghana, though several studies on host-genome associated 
with BC have been investigated molecular mechanisms of BC development and 
progression, and candidate therapeutic agents. However, a little attention has 
been given on microbial genome in this regard, although alterations in 
microbiota and epigenetic modifications are recognized as substantial risk 
factors for BC. This study focused on identifying bacterial key genes (bKGs) 
associated with BC infections in the Ghanaian population and exploring potential 
drug molecules by targeting these bKGs through in silico analyses. At first, 16S 
rRNA bacterial sequence data were downloaded from NCBI database comprising 520 
samples from BC patients and 442 from healthy controls. Analysis of 16S rRNA-Seq 
data showed significant differences in bacterial abundance between BC and 
healthy groups and identified 26 differential genera with the threshold values 
at |log2FC|>2.0 and p-value≤0.05. It was observed that two genera Prevotella and 
Anaerovibria are significantly upregulated in BC patients and others are 
downregulated. Functional analysis based on all differential genera identified 
19 MetaCyc signaling pathways, twelve of which were significantly enriched in BC 
patients by containing 165 genes Top-ranked 10 genes mdh, pykF, gapA, zwf, pgi, 
tpiA, pgk, pfkA, ppsA, and pykA were identified as BC-causing bacterial key 
genes (bKGs) through protein-protein interaction network analysis. Subsequently, 
the bKG-guided top ranked 10 drug molecules Digitoxin, Digoxin, Ledipasvir, 
Suramin, Ergotamine, Venetoclax, Nilotinib, Conivaptan, Dihydroergotamine, and 
Elbasvir were identified using molecular docking analysis. The stability of 
top-ranked three drug-target complexes (Digitoxin-pykA, Digoxin-mdh, and 
Ledipasvir-pgi) were confirmed through the molecular dynamics simulation 
studies. Therefore, these findings might be useful resources to the wet-lab 
researchers for further experimental validation on bacterial therapies against 
BC.

BACKGROUND: Thrombophilia, characterized by an increased risk of thrombosis, can 
result from genetic polymorphisms in clotting factors. This study aims to 
investigate the prevalence of factor V Leiden (G1691A), factor II prothrombin 
(G20210A), and MTHFR (C677T and A1298C) polymorphisms in a Greek population, 
evaluating not only their association with thrombophilia, but also broader 
health implications.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study involving one hundred apparently 
healthy adults from Thessaloniki, Greece. After obtaining informed consent, DNA 
was isolated and analyzed using real-time PCR to detect the frequencies of the 
aforementioned polymorphisms.
RESULTS: The genetic distribution of the examined polymorphisms aligns closely 
with that observed in Northern Europe. Factor V Leiden (FVL) and prothrombin 
G20210A mutations were predominantly wild types, with a small percentage showing 
heterozygous mutations. The MTHFR C677T and A1298C polymorphisms showed a higher 
variation in allele frequency. Certain lifestyle factors such as smoking and 
high body mass index were significantly associated with the occurrence of 
combined MTHFR genotypes, suggesting an interaction between genetic and 
environmental risk factors. Family cancer and cardiovascular history was 
significantly associated with combined FVL and prothrombin G20210A and MTHFR 
polymorphism heterozygous carriers.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that these genetic polymorphisms are not only 
pivotal in understanding thrombophilia but also have broader implications for 
cardiovascular disease and cancer. This study highlights the need for further 
research into the combined effects of genetic and epigenetic factors on health, 
which could lead to improved screening and personalized preventive healthcare 
strategies.

BACKGROUND: The association between increased cancer risk following a 
cerebrovascular event (CVE) has been previously reported. We hypothesize that 
biological age (B-age) acceleration is involved in this association. Our study 
aims to examine B-age as a novel contributing factor to cancer development 
post-CVE.
METHODS: From our prospective stroke registry (BasicMar), we selected 940 cases 
with epigenetic data. For this study, we specifically analyzed 648 of these 
patients who had available data, no prior history of cancer, and a minimum 
follow-up of 3 months. The primary outcome was cancer incidence. B-age was 
estimated using DNA methylation data derived from whole blood samples obtained 
within 24 h of stroke onset, employing various epigenetic clocks (including 
Hannum, Horvath, PhenoAge, ZhangBLUP, ZhangEN, and the mitotic epiTOC). 
Extrinsic epigenetic age acceleration (EEAA) was calculated as the residuals 
from the regression of B-age against chronological age (C-age). For epiTOC, the 
age-adjusted values were obtained by regressing out the effect of age from the 
raw epiTOC measurements. Estimated white cell counts were derived from DNA 
methylation data, and these cell fractions were used to compute the intrinsic 
epigenetic age acceleration (IEAA). Subsequently, we evaluated the independent 
association between EEAA, IEAA, and cancer incidence while controlling for 
potential confounding variables.
RESULTS: Among 648 patients with a median follow-up of 8.15 years, 83 (12.8%) 
developed cancer. Cox multivariable analyses indicated significant associations 
between Hannum, Zhang, and epiTOC EEAA and the risk of cancer after CVE. After 
adjusting for multiple testing and competing risks, EEAA measured by Hannum 
clock maintained an independent association with cancer risk. Specifically, for 
each year increase in Hannum's EEAA, we observed a 6.0% increased incidence of 
cancer (HR 1.06 [1.02-1.10], p value = 0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that epigenetic accelerated aging, as 
indicated by Hannum's EEAA, may play a significant role in the increased cancer 
risk observed in CVE survivors.

BACKGROUND: The early diagnosis rate of esophageal cancer (EC), one of the most 
prevalent digestive tract cancers worldwide, remains low.
AIM: To investigate the utility of plasma SHOX2, SEPTIN9, EPO, and RNF180 
methylation in the clinical diagnosis and monitoring of EC.
METHODS: Plasma samples were collected from 210 patients at Hubei Cancer 
Hospital, and TaqMan polymerase chain reaction was employed to detect plasma 
SHOX2, SEPTIN9, RNF180, and EPO methylation. The area under the curve was used 
to estimate their diagnostic value for EC. Cox and logistic regression analyses 
were used to estimate the independent screening risk factors for patients with 
EC.
RESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity of combined assessment of plasma SHOX2, 
SEPTIN9, RNF180, and EPO methylation for adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma 
(SCC), and EC detection were 66.67% and 86.27%, 77.40% and 85.29%, and 76.19% 
and 86.27%, respectively; the area under the curve values for diagnosing 
adenocarcinoma, SCC, and EC were 0.737 [95% confidence interval (CI): 
0.584-0.89], 0.824 (95%CI: 0.775-0.891), and 0.864 (95%CI: 0.809-0.92), 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: According to our findings, plasma SHOX2, SEPTIN9, RNF180, and EPO 
methylation exhibits appreciated sensitivity for diagnosing EC. The precise 
measurement of plasma SHOX2, SEPTIN9, RNF180, and EPO methylation can improve EC 
diagnosis and therapy efficacy monitoring.

BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: LUC7L2 may be involved in the recognition of 
non-consensus splice donor sites in association with the U1 snRNP spliceosomal 
subunit. However, their detailed features and regulatory mechanisms of LUC7L2 in 
the development of human liver cancer have not been well characterized.
RESULTS: Herein, our results demonstrate that LUC7L2 promotes the proliferation 
of liver cancer cells in vitro and xenograft transplantation in vivo. The 
proliferation ability was significantly increased in the rLV-LUC7L2 group 
compared to rLV group (24th hour: P = 0.00043; 48th hour: P = 0.000017). The 
cellular colony formation ability was significantly increased in the rLV-LUC7L2 
group compared to rLV group (25.18±6.94 % vs 67.63±9.57 %, P = 0.00009). The 
weight of transplanted tumors was significantly increased in the rLV-LUC7L2 
group compared to rLV group (0.387±0.074 vs 0.958± 0.103 g, P = 0.00004). 
Moreover, LUC7L2 effects on epigenetic regulation based on H3K4me3 in human 
liver cancer cells. e,g, RRAS. Furthermore, LUC7L2 affects transcriptome and 
proteome in liver cancer. In particular, LUC7L2 enhances the modification 
ability of H3K4me3and RNAPolII on the promoter region of RRAS and then enhances 
the expression of RRAS in liver cancer. Strikingly, LUC7L2 increases the 
increases the DNA damage repair ability dependent on RRAS. Although the DNA 
damage repair ability was significantly increased in the rLV-LUC7L2 group 
compared to rLV group(1.868±0.181 vs 0.17±0.034, P = 0.0000022), it was not 
significantly changed in rLV-LUC7L2+rLV-shRNA RRAS group compared with rLV 
group(1.868±0.181 vs 1.798±0.313, P = 0.317). Importantly, LUC7L2 enhances the 
carcinogenic function dependent on RRAS. In particular, RRAS increased the DNA 
damage repair ability by enhancing the formation of DNA damage repair dependent 
on tri-methylation of histone H3 lysine 36 (H3K36me3).
CONCLUSIONS: It is implied that LUC7L2's role in liver cancer proliferation is 
largely dependent on RRAS. The first discovery provides a basis for the 
prevention and treatment of human liver cancer.

BACKGROUND: We previously identified a sputum 12-gene methylation panel that 
predicts lung aging and risk for lung cancer.
RESEARCH QUESTION: Can the sputum methylation panel be used as a readout to 
derive a dietary pattern beneficial for lung health? Is this dietary pattern 
associated with various subjective and objective lung health phenotypes? Does 
this relationship vary among people who currently smoke vs previously smoked?
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Using the Lovelace Smoker Cohort (LSC), we employed 
the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regularized Poisson 
regression to define a dietary pattern for sputum. Associations of the dietary 
pattern with objective and subjective lung health measurements were examined 
using generalized linear and Cox models in the LSC and the Prostate, Lung, 
Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening trial.
RESULTS: The Dietary Pattern for Healthy Lung (DiPHeaL) includes low consumption 
of processed meat, and high consumption of dark green vegetables, tea, alcohol, 
and fruit juice. In the LSC, a higher DiPHeaL score (1 SD) was associated with 
better FEV1 (by 96.1 mL/s), FEV1/FVC ratio (by 1.83%), and respiratory quality 
of life (by 4.9 for activity score), and decreased cardiopulmonary mortality (by 
47%) in participants who previously smoked (all P values < .05), but not in 
participants who currently smoke. Moreover, effect sizes of the DiPHeaL score on 
respiratory quality of life measures were greater among participants who 
previously smoked with airway obstruction compared with those without. 
Associations with cardiovascular and respiratory mortality were replicated in 
PLCO participants who previously smoked . A higher DiPHeaL score was also 
associated with lower lung cancer incidence in participants who previously 
smoked, as well as reduced COPD incidence and lung cancer mortality regardless 
of smoking status in the PLCO.
INTERPRETATION: We defined a novel dietary pattern for lung epigenetic aging, 
which linked to lung health measurements. Participants who previously smoked, 
especially those with airway obstruction, may benefit the most from nutritional 
modification.

Endocrine fibroblast growth factors (eFGFs) play essential roles in cellular 
signaling processes, including development and differentiation, and are 
implicated in various cancers. However, their precise involvement in colon 
neoplasia and colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) remains incompletely understood. Here, 
we conducted a comprehensive investigation utilizing multiple databases to 
explore the multifaceted characteristics of eFGFs. Through integrated analyses 
of diverse databases, including TIMER2.0, UALCAN, OncoDB, cBioPortal, 
LinkedOmics, STRING, htfTarget, mirTarBase, circBank, and DGIdb, we explored 
eFGFs' gene expression, DNA methylation, prognostic significance, genetic 
alterations, gene regulatory networks, functional analysis, and drug 
interactions in COAD patients. Our findings revealed elevated expression levels 
of eFGFs in COAD, with aberrant gene expression potentially linked to promoter 
methylation. Importantly, hypermethylation of FGF21 and FGF23 and downregulation 
of FGF23 correlated with poor survival outcomes in COAD patients. Functional 
analyses highlighted the involvement of eFGF genes in Ras signaling, PI3K-Akt 
signaling, and cancer pathways. Furthermore, we validated our findings through a 
cross-sectional study by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction 
(qRT-PCR), confirming significant overexpression of FGF21 in colon polyps 
compared to normal mucosa. Additionally, we observed elevated RNA expression of 
FGF21 and FGF23 in adenomatous polyps compared to hyperplastic polyps. This 
study sheds new light on the critical roles of eFGFs in COAD tumorigenesis and 
underscores their potential as promising prognostic markers for COAD, as well as 
discriminative markers for distinguishing high-risk from low-risk polyps. These 
findings provide valuable insights into the complex molecular mechanisms 
underlying colorectal neoplasia and offer potential avenues for targeted 
therapeutic strategies.

BACKGROUND: Oral cancer (OC) is a significant global health concern, with 
Pakistan ranking 5th worldwide in OC incidence. Given the poor prognosis, early 
detection of at-risk individuals is crucial. Genetic factors, particularly 
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in metabolic genes, may influence OC 
susceptibility. This study investigated the association between SNPs in CYP1A1, 
COX2, SOD2, and HIF1a genes and OC risk in the Pakistani population.
METHODS: A prospective study was conducted from October 2019 to March 2022, 
enrolling 215 newly diagnosed OC patients and 410 controls. Genetic variations 
were analyzed using High-Resolution Melting (HRM) analysis and Sanger 
sequencing, with protein expression evaluated by ELISA.
RESULTS: No significant associations were found between the studied SNPs and OC 
risk. However, a non-significant trend was observed for the SOD2 variant 
(rs4880), where the G allele was associated with a higher OC risk than the A 
allele (p = 0.20). Elevated COX2 and HIF1α levels (p-values of 0.014 and 
< 0.001, respectively) and reduced SOD2 levels (p < 0.0001) were observed in OC 
patients, while CYP1A1 levels remained similar in both controls and cases.
CONCLUSION: Although SNPs in CYP1A1, COX2, SOD2, and HIF1α were not 
significantly associated with OC risk in the Pakistani population, altered 
protein expression levels of COX2, HIF1α and SOD2 suggest additional regulatory 
mechanisms. Further investigation into post-transcriptional modifications and 
epigenetic factors could lead to novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets for OC 
in Pakistan.

Predicting prognosis in lung cancer patients is important in establishing future 
treatment and monitoring plans. Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most common 
and aggressive type of lung cancer with dismal prognosis and prognostic 
stratification would help to guide treatment. Aberrant DNA methylation in tumors 
occurs earlier than clinical variations, and keeps accumulating as cancer 
progresses. Preliminary studies have given us some clues that DNA methylation 
might serve as a promising biomarker for prognosis prediction. Herein, we aimed 
to study the potential utility of DNA methylation pattern in predicting the 
recurrence risk of early stage resectable LUAD and to develop a risk-modeling 
signature based on differentially methylated regions (DMRs). This study 
consisted of three cohorts of 244 patients with stage I-IIIA LUAD, including 
marker discovery cohort (n = 39), prognostic model training cohort (n = 117) and 
validation cohort (n = 80). 468 DMRs between LUAD tumor and adjacent tissues 
were screened out in the marker discovery cohort (adjusted P < 0.05), and a 
prognostic signature was developed based on 15 DMRs significantly related to 
disease-free survival in early stage LUAD patients. The DMR signature showed 
commendable performance in predicting the recurrence risk of LUAD patients both 
in model training cohort (P < 0.001; HR = 4.32, 95% CI = 2.39-7.80) and model 
validation cohort (P = 0.009; HR = 9.08, 95% CI = 1.20-68.80), which might be of 
great utility both for understanding the molecular basis of LUAD relapse, 
providing risk stratification of patients, and establishing future monitoring 
plans.

BACKGROUND: Assessment of breast cancer (BC) risk generally relies on 
mammography, family history, reproductive history, and genotyping of major 
mutations. However, assessing the impact of environmental factors, such as 
lifestyle, health-related behavior, or external exposures, is still challenging. 
DNA methylation (DNAm), capturing both genetic and environmental effects, 
presents a promising opportunity. Previous studies have identified associations 
and predicted the risk of BC using DNAm in blood; however, these studies did not 
distinguish between genetic and environmental contributions to these DNAm sites. 
In this study, associations between DNAm and BC are assessed using paired twin 
models, which control for shared genetic and environmental effects, allowing 
testing for associations between DNAm and non-shared environmental exposures and 
behavior.
RESULTS: Pre-diagnosis blood samples of 32 monozygotic (MZ) and 76 dizygotic 
(DZ) female twin pairs discordant for BC were collected at the mean age of 56.0 
years, with the mean age at diagnosis 66.8 years and censoring 75.2 years. We 
identified 212 CpGs (p < 6.4*10-8) and 15 DMRs associated with BC risk across 
all pairs using paired Cox proportional hazard models. All but one of the BC 
risks associated with CpGs were hypomethylated, and 198/212 CpGs had their DNAm 
associated with BC risk independent of genetic effects. According to previous 
literature, at least five of the top CpGs were related to estrogen signaling. 
Following a comprehensive two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis, we found 
evidence supporting a dual causal impact of DNAm at cg20145695 (gene body of 
NXN, rs480351) with increased risk for estrogen receptor positive BC and 
decreased risk for estrogen receptor negative BC.
CONCLUSION: While causal effects of DNAm on BC risk are rare, most of the 
identified CpGs associated with the risk of BC appear to be independent of 
genetic effects. This suggests that DNAm could serve as a valuable biomarker for 
environmental risk factors for BC, and may offer potential benefits as a 
complementary tool to current risk assessment procedures.

Recent studies have implicated higher-order genome organization in the 
regulation of genes and cellular state. Lamina-Associated Domains (LADs) are 
regions of heterochromatin associated with the nuclear envelope and the nuclear 
lamina, a protein network involved in both nuclear organization and genome 
structure. LADs are developmentally regulated, and their dysregulation is 
associated with several diseases and pathological states, including cancer and 
premature aging. In addition to LADs, other nuclear protein compartments appear 
to scaffold or support unique chromatin environments to affect gene expression. 
These revelations carry profound implications for our comprehension of 
developmental processes and the pathogenesis of various diseases, especially 
given the numerous disorders already directly associated with, for example, 
mutations in lamin and INM proteins. This spatial compartmentalization of 
chromatin subtypes to unique protein compartments has led to the adoption of 
proximity-labeling methods, such as DamID (DNA Adenine Methyltransferase 
Identification), to identify these unique chromatin compartments.

Germline BRCA1 mutation carriers face a high breast cancer risk; however, the 
underlying mechanisms for this risk are not completely understood. Using a new 
genetically engineered mouse model of germline Brca1 heterozygosity, we 
demonstrate that early tumor onset in a Brca1 heterozygous background cannot be 
fully explained by the conventional 'two-hit' hypothesis, suggesting the 
existence of inherent tumor-promoting alterations in the Brca1 heterozygous 
state. Single-cell RNA sequencing and assay for transposase-accessible chromatin 
with sequencing analyses uncover a unique set of differentially accessible 
chromatin regions in ostensibly normal Brca1 heterozygous mammary epithelial 
cells, distinct from wild-type cells and partially mimicking the chromatin and 
RNA-level changes in tumor cells. Transcription factor analyses identify loss of 
ELF5 and gain of AP-1 sites in these epigenetically primed regions; in vivo 
experiments further implicate AP-1 and Wnt10a as strong promoters of 
Brca1-related breast cancer. These findings reveal a previously unappreciated 
epigenetic effect of Brca1 haploinsufficiency in accelerating tumorigenesis, 
advancing our mechanistic understanding and informing potential therapeutic 
strategies.

BACKGROUND: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has recently entered routine acute 
myeloid leukemia (AML) diagnostics. It is paramount for AML risk stratification 
and identification of molecular therapeutic targets. Most NGS feasibility and 
results data are derived from controlled clinical intervention trials (CCIT). We 
aimed to validate these data in a real-world setting.
PATIENTS, MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study retrospectively analyzed 447 AML 
patients treated at an Austrian tertiary cancer care center. A total of 284 out 
of the 447 cases were treated between 2013-2023 when NGS was locally available 
for the clinical routine.
RESULTS: The NGS was successfully performed from bone marrow biopsies and 
aspirates, with processing times decreasing from 22 days in 2013/2014 to 10 days 
in 2022. Molecular therapeutic target(s) were identified by NGS in 107/284 (38%) 
cases and enabled risk stratification in 10 cases where conventional karyotyping 
failed. Concerning molecular landscape, TET2 (27%), FLT3 (25%), DNMT3A (23%), 
and NPM1 (23%) were most frequently mutated. Comparing older and younger 
patients (cut-off 70 years) showed enrichment in older people for mutations 
affecting DNA methylation (72% vs. 45%; P < 0.001) and the spliceosome (28% vs. 
11%; P = 0.006) and more cellular signaling mutations in younger patients (61% 
vs. 46%; P = 0.022). Treatment outcomes corroborated a significant survival 
benefit in the recent NGS era and patients treated with novel/molecularly 
targeted drugs. Ultimately, biospecimens of these patients are stored within 
a leukemia biobank, generating a valuable tool for translational science.
CONCLUSION: Our study validates data from CCIT and supports their relevance for 
treatment decisions in a real-world setting. Moreover, they demonstrate the 
feasibility and benefits of NGS within a routine clinical setting.

Ubiquitously distributed environmental electrophiles covalently modify DNA and 
proteins, potentially leading to adverse health effects. However, the impacts of 
specific electrophiles on target proteins and their physiological roles remain 
largely unknown. In the present study, we focused on DNA methylation, which 
regulates gene expression and physiological responses. A total of 45 
environmental electrophiles were screened for inhibitory effects on the activity 
of DNA methyltransferase 3B (DNMT3B), a key enzyme in DNA methylation, and four 
compounds were identified. We focused on 1,2-naphthoquinone (1,2-NQ), an air 
pollutant whose toxicity has been reported previously. Interestingly, we found 
that 1,2-NQ modified multiple lysine and histidine residues in DNMT3B, one of 
which was near the active site in DNMT3B. It was found that 1,2-NQ altered gene 
expression and evoked inflammatory responses in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines. 
Furthermore, we found that 1,2-NQ upregulated CXCL8 expression through DNA 
demethylation of the distal enhancer and promoted cancer cell growth. Our study 
reveals novel mechanisms of epigenetic regulation by environmental electrophiles 
through the inhibition of DNMT3B activity and suggests their physiological 
impact.

PURPOSE: Patients with stage II and III cutaneous primary melanoma vary 
considerably in their risk of melanoma-related death. We explore the ability of 
methylation profiling to distinguish primary melanoma methylation classes and 
their associations with clinicopathologic characteristics and survival.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: InterMEL is a retrospective case-control study that 
assembled primary cutaneous melanomas from American Joint Committee on Cancer 
(AJCC) 8th edition stage II and III patients diagnosed between 1998 and 2015 in 
the United States and Australia. Cases are patients who died of melanoma within 
5 years from original diagnosis. Controls survived longer than 5 years without 
evidence of melanoma recurrence or relapse. Methylation classes, distinguished 
by consensus clustering of 850K methylation data, were evaluated for their 
clinicopathologic characteristics, 5-year survival status, and differentially 
methylated gene sets.
RESULTS: Among 422 InterMEL melanomas, consensus clustering revealed three 
primary melanoma methylation classes (MethylClasses): a CpG island methylator 
phenotype (CIMP) class, an intermediate methylation (IM) class, and a low 
methylation (LM) class. CIMP and IM were associated with higher AJCC stage (both 
P = .002), Breslow thickness (CIMP P = .002; IM P = .006), and mitotic index 
(both P < .001) compared with LM, while IM had higher N stage than CIMP (P = 
.01) and LM (P = .007). CIMP and IM had a 2-fold higher likelihood of 5-year 
death from melanoma than LM (CIMP odds ratio [OR], 2.16 [95% CI, 1.18 to 3.96]; 
IM OR, 2.00 [95% CI, 1.12 to 3.58]) in a multivariable model adjusted for age, 
sex, log Breslow thickness, ulceration, mitotic index, and N stage. Despite more 
extensive CpG island hypermethylation in CIMP, CIMP and IM shared similar 
patterns of differential methylation and gene set enrichment compared with LM.
CONCLUSION: Melanoma MethylClasses may provide clinical value in predicting 
5-year death from melanoma among patients with primary melanoma independent of 
other clinicopathologic factors.

While tobacco smoking is a risk factor in the development of oral squamous cell 
carcinoma (OSCC), only a fraction of smokers develop the disease. Compelling 
evidence shows that microbial community composition is associated with 
carcinogenesis, suggesting that the microbiome may play a role in cancer 
development of smokers. We previously showed that black raspberry (BRB) protects 
against OSCC induced by the tobacco constituent dibenzo[def,p]chrysene (DBP) via 
alteration of genetic and epigenetic markers in a manner consistent with its 
cancer preventive activity. In the present study, we conducted a mouse 
experiment to investigate the effects of BRB and DBP individually and in 
combination on the oral and gut microbiota. DBP-induced DNA damage in the mouse 
oral cavity is an essential step for the development of OSCC in mice. 16S rRNA 
gene sequencing revealed that BRB significantly increased microbial diversity 
and shifted microbiome composition in the gut and oral cavity, whereas DBP had 
no significant effect. In both gut and oral microbiota, Akkermansia muciniphila 
was significantly reduced after BRB treatment; however, this was not consistent 
with pure culture in vitro assays suggesting that the impact of BRB on A. 
muciniphila may be mediated through indirect mechanisms including the host or 
other microbes. Indeed BRB, but not DBP, was found to modulate the growth 
kinetics of human gut microbes in vitro including lactic acid bacteria and 
Bacteroides spp. The results of the current study further emphasize the 
interplay of microbiome and environmental factors in the development and 
prevention of OSCC. Prevention Relevance: Our work clearly demonstrates the 
modulatory impact of BRB on both gut and oral microbiomes within a DBP-induced 
OSCC mouse model and paves the way for future research examining a causal role 
of BRB-microbiota interactions at different stages of disease progression.

BACKGROUND: Primary screening for high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) with 
cytological triage for women with non-16/18 hrHPV-positive status has become 
popular in China. However, cytology relies on the subjective judgment of 
pathologists, leading to inconsistent clinical performance.
METHODS: A total of 657 hrHPV-positive women aged 25-64 years were enrolled in 
this cross-sectional study. All participants underwent colposcopic biopsy after 
cytology triage, with cytology residual specimens undergoing DNA methylation 
testing. CIN2+ and CIN3+ sensitivity and specificity were compared between the 
different triage strategies (n=487): PAX1 methylation (PAX1m) , Glycophorin C 
methylation (GYPCm), cytology, and combinations between them or with HPV16/18.
RESULTS: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) for 
PAX1m and GYPCm in detecting CIN2 or worse (CIN2+) were 0.867 (95% confidence 
interval [CI]: 0.796-0.937) and 0.873 (95% CI: 0.808-0.938), respectively. The 
sensitivities of PAX1m and GYPCm were consistent with those of cytology for both 
CIN2+ and CIN3+ detection. The relative specificities of PAX1m and GYPCm for 
CIN2+ detection compared to cytology were 2.83 (95% CI: 2.33-2.45) and 3.09 (95% 
CI: 2.40-3.98), respectively. The relative specificities of combining HPV 16/18 
with PAX1m and GYPCm for CIN2+ detection compared to cytology were 3.38 (95% CI: 
2.96-3.86) and 3.67 (95% CI: 3.15-4.27), respectively. Compared to low levels of 
DNA methylation, high levels of PAX1m and GYPCm resulted in odd ratios (ORs) of 
57.66 (95% CI: 13.57-409.12, p < 0.001) and 23.87 (95% CI: 6.49-115.42, p < 
0.001) for CIN3+, adjusted for HPV 16/18 and cytology results.
CONCLUSIONS: PAX1m and GYPCm demonstrated superior ability to identify cervical 
precancerous lesions and cervical cancer, with AUC values exceeding 0.85. For 
detecting CIN2+/CIN3+ in women with hrHPV-positive status, DNA methylation 
(combined with HPV 16/18) showed higher specificity than cytology (combined with 
HPV 16/18) and is a potential molecular biomarker for detecting cervical 
(pre)cancer.

Globally, gastric cancer (GC) ranks among the most prevalent forms of 
malignancy, posing a significant health burden. Epigenetic modifications, 
predominantly characterized by alterations in DNA methylation patterns, have 
been linked to a diverse array of neoplastic processes. Here, we undertake a 
comprehensive analysis of the DNA methylation signature in GC, with the aim to 
discover the potential diagnostic epigenetic biomarkers. Utilizing the Illumina 
935 K BeadChip, we conducted a genome-wide exploration of DNA methylation 
patterns in four paired samples of GC tissues and adjacent non-cancerous 
counterparts. The bisulfite-pyrosequencing (n = 7) was employed to the 
quantification for methylated gene. The pubic databases including GWAS Catalog, 
TCGA and GEO were used. The immunohistochemistry and qRT-PCR analysis were 
performed. In contrast to adjacent tissues, GC tissues manifested pronounced 
hypermethylation patterns specifically within the promoter 
cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) islands, indicating localized epigenetic 
alterations. DNA methylome analysis further revealed 4432 
differentially-methylated probes (DMPs), with the gene PRKCB exhibited the most 
prominent average DNA methylation disparity (mean Δβ = 0.353). Pyrosequencing 
validation confirmed three DMPs within the PRKCB promoter (cg08406370, 
cg00735962, and cg18526361). Notably, the mean methylation levels of PRKCB were 
inversely correlated with mRNA expression levels in the GWAS Catalog. 
Furthermore, both mRNA and protein expression levels of PRKCB were significantly 
reduced in GCs when compared to their adjacent non-cancerous counterparts, 
verified by TCGA and GEO database. Our study reveals significant DNA methylation 
alterations in GC and emphasizes the pivotal role of PRKCB gene hypermethylation 
in conferring GC risk, which offers fresh perspectives for advancing diagnostic 
approaches and therapeutic strategies for GC.

Cancer initiation and progression result from genetic and epigenetic alterations 
caused by interactions between environmental and endogenous factors leading to 
aberrant cell signalling. Colorectal cancers (CRC) are linked to abnormal 
activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, whose key feature is the nuclear 
accumulation of acetylated β-catenin in colon epithelial cells. Nuclear 
β-catenin acts as a transcriptional co-activator, targeting genes involved in 
cell proliferation and invasion. 1α,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3 or 
calcitriol), the active form of vitamin D, antagonizes Wnt/β-catenin 
over-activation by engaging its high affinity receptor, VDR. Here we unveil that 
1,25(OH)2D3-bound VDR activates Silent Information Regulator of Transcription, 
sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), leading to β-catenin deacetylation and nuclear exclusion, 
downregulation of its pro-tumourigenic target genes and inhibition of human 
colon carcinoma cell proliferation. Notably, orthogonal SIRT1 activation mimics 
nuclear exclusion of β-catenin while SIRT1 inhibition blocks the effects of 
1,25(OH)2D3. Thus, SIRT1 emerges as a crucial mediator in the protective action 
of vitamin D against CRC. The mutual negative feedback loop unveiled here 
between Wnt and SIRT1 represents an important surrogate target in CRC. Since 
nuclear localisation of β-catenin is a critical driver of CRC that requires its 
acetylation, we provide a mechanistic foundation for the epidemiological 
evidence linking vitamin D deficiency and increased CRC risk and mortality.

Colorectal cancer is one of the common malignant tumors with poor prognosis, 
which is partly due to the lack of an effective biomarker. The purpose of this 
study is to explore the impact of membrane palmitoylated protein (MPP2) on the 
prognosis of colorectal cancer patients. We obtained transcriptome data and DNA 
methylation data of 380 colorectal cancer patients from the Cancer Genome Atlas 
(TCGA). Then we used a series of bioinformatics analysis methods to reveal the 
relationship between MPP2 expression, DNA methylation sites, prognosis, immune 
checkpoint and clinical characteristics of patients. Finally, in vitro 
experiment and the meta-analysis of thousands of patients further confirmed the 
impact of MPP2 on the prognosis of colorectal cancer patients and cell migration 
and proliferation. The expression level of MPP2 is negatively regulated by its 
DNA methylation sites, which leads to its low expression in colorectal cancer. 
High expression of MPP2 is an independent prognostic risk factor, which may be a 
biomarker for colorectal cancer. Moreover, the expression of MPP2 shows a close 
relationship with immune checkpoint or immune cells infiltration, especially 
CD4+T cells. In addition, meta-analysis involving 1584 patients from four 
different data further confirmed that MPP2 was a risk factor for colorectal 
cancer. Finally, knockdown of MPP2 could significantly inhibit the proliferation 
of SW480 cells via mTOR signaling pathway. This study was the first to suggest 
that MPP2 may become a promising biomarker, and has an important role in immune 
checkpoint or immune cell infiltration in colorectal cancer.

Despite the advances in the understanding and treatment of myeloproliferative 
neoplasm (MPN), the disease remains incurable with the risk of evolution to 
acute myeloid leukemia or myelofibrosis (MF). Unfortunately, the evolution of 
the disease to MF remains poorly understood, impeding preventive and therapeutic 
options. Recent studies in solid tumor microenvironment and organ fibrosis have 
shed instrumental insights on their respective pathogenesis and drug resistance, 
yet such precise data are lacking in MPN. In this study, through a patient 
sample-driven transcriptomic and epigenetic description of the MF 
microenvironment landscape and cell-based analyses, we identify homeobox B7 
(HOXB7) overexpression and more precisely a potentially novel TGF-β/WNT/HOXB7 
pathway as associated to a pro-fibrotic and pro-osteoblastic biased 
differentiation of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). Using gene-based and 
chemical inhibition of this pathway, we reversed the abnormal phenotype of MSCs 
from patients with MF, providing the MPN field a potentially novel target to 
prevent and manage evolution to MF.

Cancer cohorts are now known to be associated with increased rates of clonal 
hematopoiesis (CH). We sort to characterize the hematopoietic compartment of 
patients with melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) given our recent 
population level analysis reporting evolving rates of secondary leukemias. The 
advent of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has dramatically changed our 
understanding of cancer biology and has altered the standards of care for 
patients. However, the impact of ICB on hematopoietic myeloid clonal expansion 
remains to be determined. We studied if exposure to ICB therapy affects 
hematopoietic clonal architecture and if their evolution contributed to altered 
hematopoiesis. Blood samples from patients with melanoma and NSCLC (n = 142) 
demonstrated a high prevalence of CH. Serial samples (or post ICB exposure 
samples; n = 25) were evaluated in melanoma and NSCLC patients. Error-corrected 
sequencing of a targeted panel of genes recurrently mutated in CH was performed 
on peripheral blood genomic DNA. In serial sample analysis, we observed that 
mutations in DNMT3A and TET2 increased in size with longer ICB exposures in the 
melanoma cohort. We also noted that patients with larger size DNMT3A mutations 
with further post ICB clone size expansion had longer durations of ICB exposure. 
All serial samples in this cohort showed a statistically significant change in 
VAF from baseline. In the serial sample analysis of NSCLC patients, we observed 
similar epigenetic expansion, although not statistically significant. Our study 
generates a hypothesis for two important questions: (a) Can DNMT3A or TET2 CH 
serve as predictors of a response to ICB therapy and serve as a novel biomarker 
of response to ICB therapy? (b) As ICB-exposed patients continue to live longer, 
the myeloid clonal expansion may portend an increased risk for subsequent 
myeloid malignancy development. Until now, the selective pressure of ICB/T-cell 
activating therapies on hematopoietic stem cells were less known and we report 
preliminary evidence of clonal expansion in epigenetic modifier genes (also 
referred to as inflammatory CH genes).

Aberrant DNA methylation plays a crucial role in breast cancer progression by 
regulating gene expression. However, the regulatory pattern of DNA methylation 
in long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) for breast cancer remains unclear. In this 
study, we integrated gene expression, DNA methylation, and clinical data from 
breast cancer patients included in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. We 
examined DNA methylation distribution across various lncRNA categories, 
revealing distinct methylation characteristics. Through genome-wide correlation 
analysis, we identified the CpG sites located in lncRNAs and the distally 
associated CpG sites of lncRNAs. Functional genome enrichment analysis, 
conducted through the integration of ENCODE ChIP-seq data, revealed that 
differentially methylated CpG sites (DMCs) in lncRNAs were mostly located in 
promoter regions, while distally associated DMCs primarily acted on enhancer 
regions. By integrating Hi-C data, we found that DMCs in enhancer and promoter 
regions were closely associated with the changes in three-dimensional chromatin 
structures by affecting the formation of enhancer-promoter loops. Furthermore, 
through Cox regression analysis and three machine learning models, we identified 
11 key methylation-driven lncRNAs (DIO3OS, ELOVL2-AS1, MIAT, LINC00536, 
C9orf163, AC105398.1, LINC02178, MILIP, HID1-AS1, KCNH1-IT1, and TMEM220-AS1) 
that were associated with the survival of breast cancer patients and constructed 
a prognostic risk scoring model, which demonstrated strong prognostic 
performance. These findings enhance our understanding of DNA methylation's role 
in lncRNA regulation in breast cancer and provide potential biomarkers for 
diagnosis.

PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is implicated in breast cancer progression and recurrence. 
The identification of PIK3CA and AKT1 mutations and loss of PTEN serve as 
selection criterion for targeted therapies involving selective inhibitors. 
However, they do not consistently align with pathway activation, and high-cost 
determinations limit their routine application. PI3K-downstream epigenetic 
regulatory mechanisms broaden the alterations that amplify pathway activity and, 
consequently, sensitivity to selective inhibitors. In this retrospective 
observational study, conducted within a cohort of early-stage breast cancer 
patients, we determined phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 (pS6) at Ser240/244 
by immunohistochemistry as an indicator of PI3K pathway activation. Log-Rank 
test and Cox proportional hazards regression were used to analyze the clinical 
relevance of pS6, alone and together with clinicopathological variables, 
regarding recurrence-free survival. ROC curves and the area under the curves 
were used to evaluate the calibration and discrimination properties of uni- and 
multivariate models. Our results show that a high percentage of pS6 positive 
tumor cells was associated with an unfavorable prognosis in a cohort of 129 
hormone receptor positive/HER2 negative breast cancer patients (Hazard 
Ratio = 5.92; Log-Rank p = 9.5e-08; median follow-up = 53 months). When assessed 
in combination with lymph node status, the predictive capacity was higher 
compared to both univariate models individually. In conclusion, pS6 could 
represent a novel independent marker for predicting recurrence risk in luminal 
breast cancer.

BACKGROUND: Breast cancer (BrCa) is the most common cancer for women globally. 
BrCa incidence varies by age and differs between racial groups, with Black women 
having an earlier age of onset and higher mortality compared to White women. The 
underlying biological mechanisms of this disparity remain uncertain. Here, we 
address this knowledge gap by examining the association between overall 
epigenetic age acceleration and BrCa initiation as well as the mediating role of 
race.
RESULTS: We measured whole-genome methylation (866,238 CpGs) using the Illumina 
EPIC array in blood DNA extracted from 209 women recruited from University 
Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center. Overall and intrinsic epigenetic age 
acceleration was calculated-accounting for the estimated white blood cell 
distribution-using the second-generation biological clock GrimAge. After quality 
control, 149 BrCa patients and 42 disease-free controls remained. The overall 
chronological mean age at BrCa diagnosis was 57.4 ± 11.4 years and nearly 
one-third of BrCa cases were self-reported Black women (29.5%). When comparing 
BrCa cases to disease-free controls, GrimAge acceleration was 2.48 years greater 
(p-value = 0.0056), while intrinsic epigenetic age acceleration was 1.72 years 
higher (p-value = 0.026) for cases compared to controls. After adjusting for 
known BrCa risk factors, we observed BrCa risk increased by 14% [odds ratio (OR) 
= 1.14; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.25] for a one-year increase in GrimAge acceleration. The 
stratified analysis by self-reported race revealed differing ORs for GrimAge 
acceleration: White women (OR = 1.17; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.36), and Black women (OR = 
1.08; 95% CI: 0.96, 1.23). However, our limited sample size failed to detect a 
statistically significant interaction for self-reported race (p-value >0.05) 
when examining GrimAge acceleration with BrCa risk.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that epigenetic age acceleration is 
associated with BrCa risk, and the association suggests variation by 
self-reported race. Although our sample size is limited, these results highlight 
a potential biological mechanism for BrCa risk and identifies a novel research 
area of BrCa health disparities requiring further inquiry.

Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been widely used to identify 
thousands of likely causal genes for diseases and complex traits using predicted 
expression models. However, most existing TWAS methods rely on gene expression 
alone and overlook other regulatory mechanisms of gene expression, including DNA 
methylation and splicing, that contribute to the genetic basis of these complex 
traits and diseases. Here we introduce a multi-omics method that integrates gene 
expression, DNA methylation, and splicing data to improve the identification of 
associated genes with our traits of interest. Through simulations and by 
analyzing genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics for 24 complex 
traits, we show that our integrated method, which leverages these complementary 
omics biomarkers, achieves higher statistical power, and improves the accuracy 
of likely causal gene identification in blood tissues over individual omics 
methods. Finally, we apply our integrated model to a lung cancer GWAS data set, 
demonstrating the integrated models improved identification of prioritized genes 
for lung cancer risk.

INTRODUCTION: N1-methyladenosine (m1A) RNA methylation is an emerging epigenetic 
modification. Its potential role in lipid metabolism and prognosis of prostate 
cancer (PCa) remains unexplored.
OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the impact of m1A on lipid metabolism and 
PCa prognosis.
METHODS: In this work, the landscape of genetic and expression variations of 10 
widely recognized m1A regulators in PCa was revealed. Combining machine-learning 
strategies, the m1A modification patterns and corresponding characteristics of 
lipid metabolism of PCa samples from the cancer genome atlas program (TCGA) 
dataset were comprehensively analyzed. In vitro assays were performed to 
identify the role of TRMT61A, the key m1A regulator, on PCa cells.
RESULTS: Two distinct m1A modification patterns and corresponding lipid 
metabolism profiles were identified in PCa. The m1A modification subgroup with a 
high risk of biochemical recurrence (BCR) has stronger mitochondrial metabolism 
and FA oxidation activity. A consensus m1A modification-related lipid metabolism 
score (mMLMS) was constructed to predict the BCR prognosis of patients with PCa. 
The mMLMS was shown to accurately predict the BCR prognosis of PCa within six 
external cohorts. Finally, TRMT61A was identified as the key m1A regulator 
related to mMLMS, and it was found to promote the progression of PCa in vitro. 
TRMT61A potentially enhances mitochondrial function and FA beta oxidation in PCa 
cells via the PI3K/AKT pathway.
CONCLUSION: m1A RNA methylation patterns are associated with characteristics of 
lipid metabolism in PCa, providing a novel treatment strategy.

Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) remains to be the most common risk factor of 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). While previous work has primarily focussed on 
understanding the direct and indirect mechanisms of Hepatitis B virus X protein 
(HBx)-mediated hepatocarcinogenesis, from genetic and epigenetic perspectives, 
its influence on RNA modification mediated onset of liver malignancies is less 
well understood. This study explored the role of HBV-encoded HBx in altering the 
m6A methylome profile and its implications on the pathogenesis of HCC. We 
established HBx-expressing stable HCC cell lines, Huh7-HBx and HepG2-HBx, and 
explored the transcriptomic and epitranscriptomic profiles by RNA-seq and 
MeRIP-seq, respectively. Preliminary results suggest that HBx promotes liver 
cell proliferation, migration, survival and overall m6A methylation in HCC cells 
and is involved in modulating the extracellular matrix. We show that HBx 
mediates liver cell transformation by upregulating KIAA1429 methyltransferase. 
HBx also drives the expression and hypermethylation of the extracellular matrix 
protein HSPG2/Perlecan and promotes tumourigenesis. Furthermore, we observed a 
potential interaction between KIAA1429 and HSPG2 in HCC liver cancer cells and 
demands further investigation.

Lymphocyte activating gene-3 (LAG3) is a distinctive T cell co-receptor that is 
expressed on the surface of lymphocytes. It plays a special inhibitory immune 
checkpoint role due to its unique domain and signaling pattern. Our aim is to 
explore the correlation between LAG3 in cancers and physiological processes 
related to a range of cancers, as well as build LAG3-related immunity and 
prognostic models. By comprehensively using of datasets and methods from TCGA, 
GTE-x and GEO databases, cBioPortal, HPA, Kaplan-Meier Plotter, Spearman, 
CellMinerTM, we delved deeper into the potential impact of the LAG3 in cancer 
development. These include expression differences, Localization of tumor cell 
subsets, immune infiltration, matrix infiltration, gene mutations, DNA 
methylation, signaling pathways and prognosis. Furthermore, we explored LAG3 
interactions with different drugs. LAG3 is highly expressed in ACC (p < 0.001), 
BRCA (p < 0.001), DLBC (p < 0.001), ESCA (p < 0.001), GBM (p < 0.001), HNSC 
(p < 0.001), KIRC (p < 0.001), LGG (p < 0.001), LUAD (p < 0.01), LUSC 
(p < 0.001), PAAD (p < 0.001), PCPG (p < 0.01), SKCM (p < 0.001), STAD 
(p < 0.001), TGCT (p < 0.001) and THCA (p < 0.05), while lowly expressed in COAD 
(p < 0.001), LIHC (p < 0.05), OV (p < 0.001), PRAD (p < 0.001), READ 
(p < 0.001), UCEC (p < 0.001) and UCS (p < 0.001). High expression of LAG3 
correlates with longer overall survival (OS) in BLCA (HR = 0.67, p < 0.05), CESC 
(HR = 0.3, p < 0.001), HNSC (HR = 0.67, p < 0.01), LUSC (HR = 0.71, p < 0.05), 
OV (HR = 0.65, p < 0.01), STAD (HR = 0.68, p < 0.05), and UCEC (HR = 0.57, 
p < 0.01). Conversely, in KIRC (HR = 1.85, p < 0.001), KIRP (HR = 2.81, 
p < 0.001), and THYM (HR = 8.92, p < 0.001), high LAG3 expression corresponds to 
shorter OS. Comprehensive results for recurrence-free survival (RFS) indicate 
that LAG3 acts as a protective factor in BLCA, CESC, OV, and UCEC. Moreover, 
LAG3 is widely expressed in tumor-associated lymphocytes, positively correlating 
with tumor immune scores and stromal scores, and significantly present in the C2 
immune subtype across various tumors. High LAG3 expression correlates with 
increased immune infiltration. LAG3 shows associations with MSI, TMB, and the 
MMR system, participating in multiple signaling pathways including the T cell 
receptor pathway. It also demonstrates positive correlations with sensitivity to 
eleven different drugs. Unlike traditional inhibitory immune checkpoints, LAG3 
exhibits dual roles in clinical and immune prognostication across pan-cancers, 
making it a significant predictive factor. In some cancers, LAG3 serves as a 
risk factor, indicating adverse clinical outcomes. Conversely, in BLCA, CESC, 
OV, and UCEC, LAG3 acts as a protective factor associated with longer patient 
survival. LAG3 demonstrates strong associations within tumor immunity, 
participating in a range of immune and inflammatory signaling pathways. Elevated 
levels of LAG3 are linked not only to T cell exhaustion but also to increased 
immune infiltration and polarization towards M1 macrophages.

Previous studies have indicated that specific CpG sites may be linked to the 
risk of prostate cancer (PCa) by regulating the expression of PCa target genes. 
However, most existing studies aim to identify DNA methylation (DNAm) biomarkers 
through blood tissue genetic instruments, which impedes the identification of 
relevant biomarkers in prostate tissue. To identify PCa risk-associated CpG 
sites in prostate tissue, we established genetic prediction models of DNAm 
levels using data from normal prostate samples in the GTEx (N = 108) and 
assessed associations between genetically predicted DNAm in prostate and PCa 
risk by studying 122,188 cases and 604,640 controls. We observed significant 
associations for 3879 CpG sites, including 926 at novel genomic loci. Among 
them, DNAm levels of 80 CpG sites located at novel loci are significantly 
associated with expression levels of 45 neighboring genes in normal prostate 
tissue. Of these genes, 11 further exhibit significant associations with PCa 
risk for their predicted expression levels in prostate tissue. Intriguingly, a 
total of 31 CpG sites demonstrate consistent association patterns across the 
methylation-gene expression-PCa risk pathway. Our findings suggest that specific 
CpG sites may be related to PCa risk by modulating the expression of nearby 
target genes.

Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play a pivotal role in cancer progression, 
including mediating tumour cell invasion via their pro-invasive secretory 
profile and ability to remodel the extracellular matrix (ECM). Given that 
reduced CAF abundance in tumours correlates with improved outcomes in various 
cancers, we set out to identify epigenetic targets involved in CAF activation in 
regions of tumour-stromal mixing with the goal of reducing tumour 
aggressiveness. Using the GLAnCE (Gels for Live Analysis of Compartmentalized 
Environments) platform, we performed an image-based, phenotypic screen that 
enabled us to identify modulators of CAF abundance and the capacity of CAFs to 
induce tumour cell invasion. We identified EHMT2 (also known as G9a), an enzyme 
that targets the methylation of histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9), as a potent modulator 
of CAF abundance and CAF-mediated tumour cell invasion. Transcriptomic and 
functional analysis of EHMT2-inhibited CAFs revealed EHMT2 participated in 
driving CAFs towards a pro-invasive phenotype and mediated CAF 
hyperproliferation, a feature typically associated with activated fibroblasts in 
tumours. Our study suggests that EHMT2 regulates CAF state within the tumour 
microenvironment by impacting CAF activation, as well as by magnifying the 
pro-invasive effects of these activated CAFs on tumour cell invasion through 
promoting CAF hyperproliferation.

Hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)], one common environmental contaminant, has long 
been recognized as a carcinogen associated with lung cancer, but roles and 
mechanisms of Cr(VI)-induced epigenetic dysregulations in carcinogenesis remain 
to be investigated. In this study, we identified that RNA m5C methyltransferase 
NSUN2 was significantly upregulated in Cr(VI)-transformed cells and lung tissues 
of Cr(VI)-exposed mice. Inhibition of NSUN2 reduced cell proliferation, 
migration, colony formation and tube formation abilities. We found 
NSUN2-mediated m5C modification induced metabolic reprogramming and cell cycle 
by promoting the mRNA stabilities of ME1, GLUT3 and CDK2. In addition, knockdown 
of NSUN2 attenuated tumorigenesis and angiogenesis in vivo. RNA m5C reader 
ALYREF was identified to be involved in NSUN2-mediated m5C modification in Cr 
(VI)-induced carcinogenesis. Further study showed that EP300 induced NSUN2 
upregulation through transcriptional activation by inducing histone modification 
at H3K27ac site for regulating Cr(VI) carcinogenesis. Our findings demonstrated 
novel role and mechanism of NSUN2 and epigenetic changes by increasing the RNA 
m5C modification that are important for Cr (VI)-induced carcinogenesis through 
NSUN2/ALYREF pathway. NSUN2, ALYREF, ME1, GLUT3 or/and CDK2 may be used as 
potential new biomarkers or/and therapeutic target(s) in the future.

PURPOSE: Using the prostate, lung, colorectal, and ovarian (PLCO) Cancer 
Screening Trial samples, we identified cell-free DNA (cfDNA) candidate 
biomarkers bearing the epigenetic mark 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) that 
detected occult colorectal cancer (CRC) up to 36 months before clinical 
diagnosis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed the 5hmC-seal assay and sequencing on ≤8 ng 
cfDNA extracted from PLCO study participant plasma samples, including n = 201 
cases (diagnosed with CRC within 36 months of blood collection) and n = 401 
controls (no cancer diagnosis on follow-up). We conducted association studies 
and machine learning modeling to analyze the genome-wide 5hmC profiles within 
training and validation groups that were randomly selected at a 2:1 ratio.
RESULTS: We successfully obtained 5hmC profiles from these decades-old samples. 
A weighted Cox model of 32 5hmC-modified gene bodies showed a predictive 
detection value for CRC as early as 36 months before overt tumor diagnosis 
(training set AUC, 77.1% [95% CI, 72.2 to 81.9] and validation set AUC, 72.8% 
[95% CI, 65.8 to 79.7]). Notably, the 5hmC-based predictive model showed 
comparable performance regardless of sex and race/ethnicity, and significantly 
outperformed risk factors such as age and obesity (assessed as BMI). Finally, 
when splitting cases at median weighted prediction scores, Kaplan-Meier analyses 
showed significant risk stratification for CRC occurrence in both the training 
set (hazard ratio, [HR], 3.3 [95% CI, 2.6 to 5.8]) and validation set (HR, 3.1 
[95% CI, 1.8 to 5.8]).
CONCLUSION: Candidate 5hmC biomarkers and a scoring algorithm have the potential 
to predict CRC occurrence despite the absence of clinical symptoms and effective 
predictors. Developing a minimally invasive clinical assay that detects 
5hmC-modified biomarkers holds promise for improving early CRC detection and 
ultimately patient outcomes.

The proliferation, metastasis, and drug resistance of cancer cells pose 
significant challenges to the treatment of lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). 
However, there is a lack of optimal predictive models that can accurately 
forecast patient prognosis and guide the selection of targeted therapies. The 
extensive multi-omic data obtained from multi-level molecular biology provides a 
unique perspective for understanding the underlying biological characteristics 
of cancer, offering potential prognostic indicators and drug sensitivity 
biomarkers for LUSC patients. We integrated diverse datasets encompassing gene 
expression, DNA methylation, genomic mutations, and clinical data from LUSC 
patients to achieve consensus clustering using a suite of 10 multi-omics 
integration algorithms. Subsequently, we employed 10 commonly used machine 
learning algorithms, combining them into 101 unique configurations to design an 
optimal performing model. We then explored the characteristics of high- and 
low-risk LUSC patient groups in terms of the tumor microenvironment and response 
to immunotherapy, ultimately validating the functional roles of the model genes 
through in vitro experiments. Through the application of 10 clustering 
algorithms, we identified two prognostically relevant subtypes, with CS1 
exhibiting a more favorable prognosis. We then constructed a subtype-specific 
machine learning model, LUSC multi-omics signature (LMS) based on seven key hub 
genes. Compared to previously published LUSC biomarkers, our LMS score 
demonstrated superior predictive performance. Patients with lower LMS scores had 
higher overall survival rates and better responses to immunotherapy. Notably, 
the high LMS group was more inclined toward ""cold"" tumors, characterized by 
immune suppression and exclusion, but drugs like dasatinib may represent 
promising therapeutic options for these patients. Notably, we also validated the 
model gene SERPINB13 through cell experiments, confirming its role as a 
potential oncogene influencing the progression of LUSC and as a promising 
therapeutic target. Our research provides new insights into refining the 
molecular classification of LUSC and further optimizing immunotherapy

Globally, colorectal cancer (CRC) is the malignant tumor with the highest 
mortality rate after lung cancer. Abnormal DNA methylation drives dysregulated 
gene expression, thereby promoting CRC progression and leading to poor 
prognosis. We identified a 3-CpG methylation signature that is independently 
associated with CRC prognosis. The model consists of three methylation-driven 
genes: FAM3 Metabolism Regulating Signaling Molecule D (FAM3D), DAPP1, and PIGR. 
However, the prognostic significance, biological function, and related 
mechanisms of the individual methylation-driven gene FAM3D in CRC have not been 
studied. Here, we discovered that FAM3D expression was reduced in CRC tissues 
and cells, and that high methylation and low expression of FAM3D were 
independent prognostic risk factors for CRC. In addition, FAM3D promoted the 
growth and movement of CRC cells in vitro and the proliferation in nude mice, 
mainly by inhibiting ATF4 transcription and downregulating SESN2 expression, and 
ultimately activating mTORC1. Furthermore, FAM3D resulted in reduced sensitivity 
of CRC cells to oxaliplatin, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil. Our study showed 
that FAM3D activates the mTORC1 pathway through the ATF4-SESN2 axis and promotes 
the malignant progression of CRC, which contributes to predict CRC prognosis and 
guide individualized treatment.

Anoikis, a form of programmed cell death induced by loss of cell contact, is 
closely associated with tumor invasion and metastasis, making it highly 
significant in lung cancer research. We examined the expression patterns and 
prognostic relevance of Anoikis-related genes (ARGs) in lung adenocarcinoma 
(LUAD) using the TCGA-LUAD database. This study identified molecular subtypes 
associated with Anoikis in LUAD and conducted functional enrichment analyses. We 
constructed an ARG risk score using univariate least absolute shrinkage and 
selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression, validated externally with GEO 
datasets and clinical samples. The clinical applicability of the prognostic 
model was evaluated using nomograms, calibration curves, decision curve analysis 
(DCA), and time-dependent AUC assessments. We identified four prognostically 
significant genes (PLK1, SLC2A1, CDKN3, PHLDA2) and two ARG-related molecular 
subtypes. ARGs were generally upregulated in LUAD and correlated with multiple 
pathways including the cell cycle and DNA replication. The prognostic model 
indicated that the low-risk group had better outcomes and significant 
correlations with clinicopathological features, tumor microenvironment, immune 
therapy responses, drug sensitivity, and pan-RNA epigenetic modification-related 
genes. Patients with low-risk LUAD were potential beneficiaries of immune 
checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy. Prognostic ARGs' distribution and expression 
across various immune cell types were further analyzed using single-cell RNA 
sequencing. The pivotal role of CDKN3 in LUAD was confirmed through qRT-PCR and 
gene knockout experiments, demonstrating that CDKN3 knockdown inhibits tumor 
cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Additionally, we constructed a 
ceRNA network involving CDKN3/hsa-miR-26a-5p/SNHG6, LINC00665, DUXAP8, and 
SLC2A1/hsa-miR-218-5p/RNASEH1-AS1, providing new insights for personalized and 
immune therapy decisions in LUAD patients.

Brain metastases (BMs) are the most common and among the deadliest brain tumors. 
Currently, there are no reliable predictors of BM development from primary 
cancer, which limits early intervention. Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most 
common BM source and here we obtained 402 tumor and plasma samples from a large 
cohort of patients with LUAD with or without BM (n = 346). LUAD DNA methylation 
signatures were evaluated to build and validate an accurate model predicting BM 
development from LUAD, which was integrated with clinical factors to provide 
comprehensive patient-specific BM risk probabilities in a nomogram. 
Additionally, immune and cell interaction gene sets were differentially 
methylated at promoters in BM versus paired primary LUAD and had aligning 
dysregulation in the proteome. Immune cells were differentially abundant in BM 
versus LUAD. Finally, liquid biomarkers identified from methylated cell-free DNA 
sequenced in plasma were used to generate and validate accurate classifiers for 
early BM detection. Overall, LUAD methylomes can be leveraged to predict and 
noninvasively identify BM, moving toward improved patient outcomes with 
personalized treatment.

BACKGROUND: Epigenetic clocks are mathematical models used to estimate 
epigenetic age based on DNA methylation at specific CpG sites. As new 
methylation microarrays are developed and older models discontinued, existing 
epigenetic clocks might become obsolete. Here, we explored the effects of the 
changes introduced in the new EPICv2 DNA methylation array on existing 
epigenetic clocks.
METHODS: We tested the performance of four epigenetic clocks on the probeset of 
the EPICv2 array using a dataset of 10,835 samples. We developed a new 
epigenetic age prediction model compatible across the 450 k, EPICv1, and EPICv2 
microarrays and validated it on 2095 samples. We estimated technical noise and 
intra-subject variation using two datasets with repeated sampling. We used data 
from (i) cancer survivors who had undergone different therapies, (ii) breast 
cancer patients and controls, and (iii) an exercise-based interventional study, 
to test the ability of our model to detect alterations in epigenetic age 
acceleration in response to theoretically antiaging interventions.
RESULTS: The results of the four epiclocks tested are significantly distorted by 
the EPICv2 probeset, causing an average difference of up to 25 years. Our new 
model produced highly accurate chronological age predictions, comparable to a 
state-of-the-art epiclock. The model reported the lowest epigenetic age 
acceleration in normal populations, as well as the lowest variation across 
technical replicates and repeated samples from the same subjects. Finally, our 
model reproduced previous results of increased epigenetic age acceleration in 
cancer patients and in survivors treated with radiation therapy, and no changes 
from exercise-based interventions.
CONCLUSION: Existing epigenetic clocks require updates for full EPICv2 
compatibility. Our new model translates the capabilities of state-of-the-art 
epigenetic clocks to the EPICv2 platform and is cross-compatible with older 
microarrays. The characterization of epigenetic age prediction variation 
provides useful metrics to contextualize the relevance of epigenetic age 
alterations. The analysis of data from subjects influenced by radiation, cancer, 
and exercise-based interventions shows that despite being good predictors of 
chronological age, neither a pathological state like breast cancer, a hazardous 
environmental factor (radiation), nor exercise (a beneficial intervention) 
caused significant changes in the values of the ""epigenetic age"" determined by 
these first-generation models.

BACKGROUND: Gastric and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer represents a 
significant global health challenge, with high recurrence rates and poor 
survival outcomes. This study investigates circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) as a 
biomarker for assessing recurrence risk in patients with resectable gastric and 
GEJ adenocarcinomas (AC).
METHODS: Patients with resectable gastric and GEJ AC, undergoing perioperative 
chemotherapy and surgery, were prospectively enrolled. Serial plasma samples 
were collected at baseline, after one cycle of chemotherapy, after preoperative 
chemotherapy, and after surgery. ctDNA was assessed by a ddPCR test (TriMeth), 
which targets the gastrointestinal cancer-specific methylation patterns of the 
genes C9orf50, KCNQ5, and CLIP4.
RESULTS: ctDNA analysis was performed on 229 plasma samples from 86 patients. At 
baseline, ctDNA was detected in 56% of patients, which decreased to 37% 
following one cycle of chemotherapy, 25% after preoperative chemotherapy and 15% 
after surgical resection. The presence of ctDNA after one cycle of chemotherapy 
was associated with reduced recurrence-free survival (RFS) (HR = 2.54, 95% 
confidence interval (CI) 1.33-4.85, p = 0.005) and overall survival (OS) 
(HR = 2.23, 95% CI 1.07-4.62, p = 0.032). Similarly, ctDNA after surgery was 
associated with significantly shorter RFS (HR = 6.22, 95% CI 2.39-16.2, 
p < 0.001) and OS (HR = 6.37, 95% CI 2.10-19.3, p = 0.001). Multivariable 
regression analysis confirmed ctDNA after surgery as an independent prognostic 
factor (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: ctDNA analysis has the potential to identify patients at elevated 
risk of recurrence, thus providing personalized treatment strategies for 
patients with resectable gastric and GEJ cancer. Further validation in larger 
cohorts and ctDNA-guided interventions are needed for future clinical use.

Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) transformation accounts for 3-14% of resistance in 
EGFR-TKI relapsed lung adenocarcinomas (LUADs), with unknown molecular 
mechanisms and optimal treatment strategies. We performed transcriptomic 
analyses (including bulk and spatial transcriptomics) and multiplex 
immunofluorescence on pre-treated samples from LUADs without transformation 
after EGFR-TKI treatment (LUAD-NT), primary SCLCs (SCLC-P) and LUADs with 
transformation after EGFR-TKI treatment (before transformation: LUAD-BT; after 
transformation: SCLC-AT). Our study found that LUAD-BT exhibited potential 
transcriptomic characteristics for transformation compared with LUAD-NT. We 
identified several pathways that shifted during transformation, and the 
transformation might be promoted by epigenetic alterations (such as HDAC10, 
HDAC1, DNMT3A) within the tumor cells instead of within the tumor 
microenvironment. For druggable pathways, transformed-SCLC were proved to be 
less dependent on EGF signaling but more relied on FGF signaling, while 
VEGF-VEGFR pathway remained active, indicating potential treatments after 
transformation. We also found transformed-SCLC showed an immuno-exhausted status 
which was associated with the duration of EGFR-TKI before transformation. 
Besides, SCLC-AT exhibited distinct molecular subtypes from SCLC-P. Moreover, we 
constructed an ideal 4-marker model based on transcriptomic and IHC data to 
predict SCLC transformation, which obtained a sensitivity of 100% and 87.5%, a 
specificity of 95.7% and 100% in the training and test cohorts, respectively. We 
provided insights into the molecular mechanisms of SCLC transformation and the 
differences between SCLC-AT and SCLC-P, which might shed light on prevention 
strategies and subsequent therapeutic strategies for SCLC transformation in the 
future.

BACKGROUND: Early diagnosis remains an obstacle for improving the outcome of 
lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). DNA methylation changes in peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) could reflect an immune response to tumorigenesis, 
providing the theoretical basis for early cancer diagnosis based on immune cell 
profiling.
METHODS: This multi-center study evaluated the DNA methylation patterns based on 
PBMCs samples from 1115 individuals at nine medical centers. Genome-wide DNA 
methylation profiling of PBMCs in a discovery cohort (35 LUAD patients and 50 
healthy controls) was performed using Illumina 850K microarray. Candidate 
differentially methylated CpG positions (DMPs) were selected and validated in a 
two-step DMPs screening cohort (65 LUAD patients and 80 healthy controls) by 
pyrosequencing and multiple target region methylation enrichment sequencing 
(MTRMES). Then, an early LUAD Diagnostic Panel (LDP score) based on multisite 
methylation-specific chip-based digital PCR was constructed in a training set 
and then confirmed in a validation set from the LDP score development cohort 
(389 AIS/stage I LUAD patients and 293 healthy controls). Besides, we included 
157 other cancer patients, including 52 gastric cancer (GC) patients, 50 breast 
cancer (BC) patients, and 55 colorectal cancer (CRC) patients to assess the 
specificity of the LDP score. In addition, we also evaluated the early warning 
ability of LDP score for LUAD in a prospective cohort (46 people who were at 
high-risk of developing LC).
RESULTS: A total of 1415 LUAD-specific DMPs were identified. Then, six DMPs were 
selected for validation and three DMPs were finally verified. The LDP score was 
constructed by combining the three DMPs, age, and sex, and showed an AUC of 
0.916, sensitivity of 88.17%, and specificity of 80.20% in a combined set, 
outperforming traditional methods, such as CEA and CT (detection rate: 87.79% 
vs. 4.69%; 87.79% vs. 35.21%). This diagnostic performance was confirmed in 
sub-types of LUAD with clinical challenges, such as 6-20 mm LUAD (AUC: 0.914, 
95% CI: 0.889-0.934) and ground-glass nodules (AUC: 0.916, 95% CI: 0.889-0.938). 
Importantly, our LDP score had significant improvement in terms of selecting 
high-risk individuals who should receive low-dose computed tomography (87.80% 
vs. 9.28%). Remarkably, the LDP score could predict LUAD around 2 years before 
clinical diagnosis in our prospective cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: The novel developed LDP score represented a convenient and 
effective assay for the detection of AIS/stage I LUAD with high sensitivity and 
specificity, and had demonstrated unique advantages over traditional detection 
methods.

CREB gene family (ATF1, CREB1, CREM) fusions with either EWSR1 or FUS gene 
partners drive the pathogenesis of a wide range of neoplasms, including various 
soft tissue tumors, intracranial myxoid mesenchymal tumors (IMMTs), hyalinizing 
clear cell carcinoma (HCCC), and rare mesotheliomas. Recently, a SMARCA2::CREM 
fusion was reported in one case each of IMMT and HCCC. In this study, we expand 
the clinicopathologic and molecular spectrum of these neoplasms by describing 
three additional cases with SMARCA2::CREM and one with a novel SMARCA4::CREM 
fusion, highlighting the recurrent potential of additional CREB gene fusion 
partners beyond FET family members. To evaluate if these fusions define a new 
pathologic entity, we performed a comprehensive genomic and methylation analysis 
and compared the results to other related tumors. Tumors occurred in children 
and young adults (median age 20 years) and spanned a broad anatomic 
distribution, including soft tissue, intracranial, head and neck, and prostatic 
urethra. Microscopically, the tumors shared an undifferentiated round to 
epithelioid cell phenotype and a hyalinized fibrous stroma. 
Immunohistochemically, a polyphenotypic profile was observed, with variable 
expression of SOX10, desmin, and/or epithelial markers. No targetable genomic 
alterations were found using panel-based DNA sequencing. By DNA methylation and 
transcriptomic analyses, tumors grouped closely to FET::CREB entities, but not 
with SMARCA4/SMARCB1-deficient tumors. High expression of CREM by 
immunohistochemistry was also documented in these tumors. Patients experienced 
local recurrence (n = 2), locoregional lymph node metastases (n = 2), and an 
isolated visceral metastasis (n = 1). Overall, our study suggests that 
SMARCA2/4::CREM fusions define a distinct group of neoplasms with round cell to 
epithelioid histology, a variable immunoprofile, and a definite risk of 
malignancy. Larger studies are needed to further explore the pathogenetic 
relationship with the FET::CREB family of tumors. © 2024 The Pathological

Accurate, non-invasive, and cost-effective tools are needed to assist pulmonary 
nodule diagnosis and management due to increasing detection by low-dose computed 
tomography (LDCT). We perform genome-wide methylation sequencing on malignant 
and non-malignant lung tissues and designed a panel of 263 differential DNA 
methylation regions, which is used for targeted methylation sequencing on blood 
cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in two prospectively collected and retrospectively 
analyzed multicenter cohorts. We develop and optimize an integrative model for 
risk stratification of pulmonary nodules based on 40 cfDNA methylation 
biomarkers, age, and five simple computed tomography (CT) imaging features using 
machine learning approaches and validate its good performance in two cohorts. 
Using the two-threshold strategy can effectively reduce unnecessary invasive 
surgeries, overtreatment costs, and injury for patients with benign nodules 
while advising immediate treatment for patients with lung cancer, which can 
potentially improve the overall diagnosis of lung cancer following LDCT/CT 
screening.

Benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) is a well-known polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) 
pollutant with high carcinogenicity, widespread environmental presence, and 
significant threat to public health. Epidemiological studies have linked 
exposure to B[a]P and its metabolite 7,8-dihydroxy-9,10-epoxybenzo[a]pyrene 
(BPDE) to the development and progression of various cancers, including bladder 
cancer. However, its underlying mechanism remains unclear. Our study revealed 
that B[a]P and BPDE induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a critical 
early event in cell malignant transformation, involving a decrease in E-Cadherin 
and upregulation of N-Cadherin protein levels, leading to increased cell 
motility and migration in bladder epithelial cells. Further studies have 
indicated that LOXL1 DNA undergoes methylation and modification influenced by 
methyltransferase 3a (DNMT3a) and DNMT3b, resulting in decreased LOXL1 protein 
levels. The decreased LOXL1 promotes the zinc finger transcription factor SLUG, 
which then inhibits E-Cadherin protein levels and initiates the EMT process. 
Moreover, DNMT3a/3b expression appears to be influenced by intracellular 
oxidative stress levels. These findings suggest that exposure to B[a]P/BPDE 
promotes the EMT process through the pivotal factor LOXL1, thereby contributing 
to bladder carcinogenesis. Our study provides a theoretical basis for 
considering LOXL1 as a potential biomarker for early diagnosis and a novel 
target for the precise diagnosis and treatment of bladder cancer.

In pancreatic cancer, the tumor microenvironment (TME) accounts for up to 90% of 
the tumor mass. Pancreatitis, characterized by the increased infiltration of 
macrophages into the pancreas, is a known risk factor for pancreatic cancer. The 
NRF2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2) transcription factor 
regulates responses to oxidative stress and can promote cancer and 
chemoresistance. NRF2 also attenuates inflammation through the regulation of 
macrophage-specific genes. Heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) is expressed by 
anti-inflammatory macrophages to degrade heme, and its expression is dependent 
on NRF2 translocation to the nucleus. In macrophages stimulated with conditioned 
media from pancreatic cancer cells, HO-1 protein levels increased, which 
correlated with higher NRF2 expression in the nuclear fraction. Significant 
differences in macrophage infiltration and HO-1 expression were detected in 
LSL-KrasG12D/+; Pdx-1-Cre (KC) mice, Nrf2 whole-body knockout (KO) mice and 
wildtype mice with pancreatitis. Since epigenetic modulation is a mechanism used 
by tumors to regulate the TME, using small molecules as epigenetic modulators to 
activate immune recognition is therapeutically desirable. When the bromodomain 
inhibitor I-BET-762 was used to treat macrophages or mice with pancreatitis, 
high levels of HO-1 were reduced. This study shows that bromodomain inhibitors 
can be used to prevent physiological responses to inflammation that promote 
tumorigenesis.

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are myeloid malignancies with heterogeneous 
genotypes and phenotypes, characterized by ineffective haematopoiesis and a high 
risk of progression towards acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Prognosis for 
patients treated with hypomethylating agents (HMAs), as is azacytidine, the main 
drug used as frontline therapy for MDS is mostly based on cytogenetics and next 
generation sequencing (NGS) of the initial myeloid clone. Although the critical 
influence of the epigenetic landscape upon cancer cells survival and development 
as well on tumour environment establishment is currently recognized and 
approached within current clinical practice in MDS, the heterogenous response of 
the patients to epigenetic therapy is suggesting a more complex mechanism of 
action, as is the case of RNA methylation. In this sense, the newly emerging 
field of epitranscriptomics could provide a more comprehensive perspective upon 
the modulation of gene expression in malignancies, as is the proof-of-concept of 
MDS. We initially did RNA methylation sequencing on MDS patients (n = 6) treated 
with azacytidine and compared responders with non-responders. Afterwards, the 
genes identified were assessed in vitro and afterwards validated on a larger 
cohort of MDS patients treated with azacytidine (n = 58). Our data show that a 
more accurate prognosis could be based on analysing the methylome and thus we 
used methylation sequencing to differentially split high-grade MDS patients with 
identical demographical and cytogenetic features, between azacytidine responders 
and non-responders.

Tumors of the major and minor salivary glands histologically encompass a diverse 
and partly overlapping spectrum of frequent diagnostically challenging 
neoplasms. Despite recent advances in molecular testing and the identification 
of tumor-specific mutations or gene fusions, there is an unmet need to identify 
additional diagnostic biomarkers for entities lacking specific alterations. In 
this study, we collected a comprehensive cohort of 363 cases encompassing 20 
different salivary gland tumor entities and explored the potential of DNA 
methylation to classify these tumors. We were able to show that most entities 
show specific epigenetic signatures and present a machine learning algorithm 
that achieved a mean balanced accuracy of 0.991. Of note, we showed that 
cribriform adenocarcinoma is epigenetically distinct from classical polymorphous 
adenocarcinoma, which could support risk stratification of these tumors. 
Myoepithelioma and pleomorphic adenoma form a uniform epigenetic class, 
supporting the theory of a single entity with a broad but continuous morphologic 
spectrum. Furthermore, we identified a histomorphologically heterogeneous but 
epigenetically distinct class that could represent a novel tumor entity. In 
conclusion, our study provides a comprehensive resource of the DNA methylation 
landscape of salivary gland tumors. Our data provide novel insight into disputed 
entities and show the potential of DNA methylation to identify new tumor 
classes. Furthermore, in future, our machine learning classifier could support 
the histopathologic diagnosis of salivary gland tumors.

SETTING/SAMPLE: HPV-positive women recruited from the general cervical screening 
population.
METHODS: 403 HPV-positive samples including 113 normal, 173 low-grade cervical 
intraepithelial neoplasia (LG-CIN), 114 HG-CIN and three cervical cancers. All 
samples were assessed by liquid-based cytology, HPV genotyping and PAX1/SOX1 
methylation.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: AUC (area under the curve), sensitivity and specificity 
for cytology, HPV16/18 genotyping and PAX1/SOX1 methylation for high-grade (HG) 
premalignant cervical lesions.
RESULTS: PAX1 was more sensitive than cytology and HPV16/18 genotyping in 
detecting a HG lesion (CIN2+). The sensitivity for PAX1, SOX1, cytology and 
HPV16/18 were 73.5% (95% CI: 65.5-81.5), 41.9% (95% CI: 32.9-50.8), 48.7% (95% 
CI: 39.7-57.8) and 36.8% (95% CI: 28.0-45.5), respectively, and their respective 
specificities were 70.3% (95% CI: 65.0-75.6), 83.6% (95% CI: 79.3-87.9), 77.6% 
(95% CI: 72.8-82.5) and 67.1% (95% CI: 61.7-72.6), respectively. Overall, PAX1 
gave the best AUC at 0.72. Adding SOX1 to PAX1 did not improve the AUC (0.68). 
Three hundred and twenty-two women who did not have a HG lesion at baseline were 
followed up for two rounds of screening. Fewer women developed a HG lesion with 
a normal baseline PAX1 compared to women with a normal baseline cytology or 
negative HPV16/18 (8.4% vs. 14.5% and 17.5%, respectively).
CONCLUSION: PAX1 triage for referral to colposcopy in HPV-positive women may be 
superior to cytology and HPV16/18 genotyping.

Human Na+-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (hNTCP) is predominantly 
expressed in hepatocytes, maintaining bile salt homeostasis and serving as a 
receptor for hepatitis B virus (HBV). hNTCP expression is downregulated during 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development. In this study, we investigated the 
molecular mechanisms underlying hNTCP dysregulation using HCC tissues and cell 
lines, and primary human hepatocytes (PHHs). Firstly, we observed a significant 
reduction of hNTCP in HCC tumors compared to adjacent and normal tissues. 
Additionally, hNTCP mRNA levels were markedly lower in HepG2 cells compared to 
PHHs, which was corroborated at the protein level by immunoblotting. Sanger 
sequencing confirmed identical sequences for hNTCP promoter, exons, and mRNA 
coding sequences between PHH and HepG2 cells, indicating no mutations or 
splicing alterations. We then assessed the epigenetic status of hNTCP. The hNTCP 
promoter, with low CG content, showed no significant methylation differences 
between PHH and HepG2 cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with qPCR 
(ChIP-qPCR) revealed a loss of activating histone posttranslational modification 
(PTM) H3K27ac near the hNTCP transcription start site (TSS) in HepG2 cells. This 
loss was also confirmed in HCC tumor cells compared to adjacent and background 
cells. Treating HepG2 cells with histone deacetylase inhibitors enhanced H3K27ac 
accumulation and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) binding at the hNTCP TSS, 
significantly increasing hNTCP mRNA and protein levels, and rendering the cells 
susceptible to HBV infection. In summary, histone PTM-related epigenetic 
mechanisms play a critical role in hNTCP dysregulation in liver cancer cells, 
providing insights into hepatocarcinogenesis and its impact on chronic HBV 
infection.
IMPORTANCE: HBV is a hepatotropic virus that infects human hepatocytes 
expressing the viral receptor hNTCP. Without effective antiviral therapy, 
chronic HBV infection poses a high risk of liver cancer. However, most liver 
cancer cell lines, including HepG2 and Huh7, do not support HBV infection due to 
the absence of hNTCP expression, and the mechanism underlying this defect 
remains unclear. This study demonstrates a significant reduction of hNTCP in 
hepatocellular carcinoma samples and HepG2 cells compared to normal liver 
tissues and primary human hepatocytes. Despite identical hNTCP genetic 
sequences, epigenetic analyses revealed a loss of the activating histone 
modification H3K27ac near the hNTCP transcription start site in cancer cells. 
Treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors restored H3K27ac levels, 
reactivated hNTCP expression, and rendered HepG2 cells susceptible to HBV 
infection. These findings highlight the role of epigenetic modulation in hNTCP 
dysregulation, offering insights into hepatocarcinogenesis and its implications 
for chronic HBV infection.

BACKGROUND: The risk of cervical cancer progression in high-risk human 
papillomavirus (HR-HPV)-positive women is associated with cervical lesion 
severity and molecular heterogeneity. Classification systems based on p16 and 
Ki67 expression cumulative scores (0-3 each)-p16/Ki67 collectively known as an 
immunoscore [IS]-are an accurate and reproducible method for grading cervical 
intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) lesions. Meanwhile, DNA methylation is an early 
event in the development of cervical cancer. Hence, this study evaluated the 
relationship among CIN, p16/Ki-67 IS, and PAX1/ZNF582 methylation.
METHODS: In this study, 414 HPV-positive paraffin-embedded specimens were 
collected, and PAX1/ZNF582 methylation and the p16/ki67 IS were determined. A 
total of 43 invalid samples were excluded and 371 were included in the 
statistical analyses. There were 103 cervicitis, 95 CIN1, 71 CIN2, 89 CIN3, and 
13 squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cases. The association between PAX1/ZNF582 
methylation and p16/Ki6 immunohistochemical staining scores was analyzed.
RESULTS: The ΔCp of PAX1m (PAX1 methylation) and ZNF582m (ZNF582 methylation) 
decreased with cervical lesion severity (Cuzick trend test, all P < 0.001). The 
severity of the cervical lesions and p16, Ki67, and p16/Ki67 IS showed an 
increasing trend (Multinomial Cochran-Armitage trend test, all P < 0.001). The 
prevalence of PAX1m/ZNF582m increased with an increase in the IS of p16, Ki67, 
and p16/Ki67 (Cochran-Armitage trend test, all P < 0.001). In cervical SCC, the 
IS was 5-6, and the PAX1m/ZNF582m was positive. Meanwhile, heterogeneity was 
observed in CIN lesions: 10 cases had an IS of 3-4 and were 
PAX1m/ZNF582m-positive in ≤ CIN1; 1 case had an IS of 0-2 and was 
PAX1m/ZNF582m-positive in CIN2/3.
CONCLUSIONS: Significant heterogeneity was observed in CIN lesions for p16 and 
Ki67 immunohistochemical staining scores and PAX1/ZNF582 methylation. This may 
help clinicians personalize the management of CIN based on the predicted 
short-term risk of cancer progression, minimizing the rate of missed CIN1 
diagnoses and incorrect treatment of CIN2/3.

BACKGROUND: Metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (mPDAC) patients have 
very poor prognosis highlighting the urgent need of novel treatments. In this 
regard, repurposing non-oncology already-approved drugs might be an attractive 
strategy to offer more-effective treatment easily tested in clinical trials. 
Accumulating evidence suggests that epigenetic deregulation is a hallmark of 
cancer contributing to treatment resistance in several solid tumors, including 
PDAC. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) are epigenetic drugs we have 
investigated preclinically and clinically as anticancer agents. Valproic acid 
(VPA) is a generic low-cost anticonvulsant and mood stabilizer with HDAC 
inhibitory activity, and anticancer properties also demonstrated in PDAC models. 
Statins use was reported to be associated with lower mortality risk in patients 
with pancreatic cancer and statins have been shown to have a direct antitumor 
effect when used alone or in combination therapy. We recently showed capability 
of VPA/Simvastatin (SIM) combination to potentiate the antitumor activity of 
gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel in vitro and in vivo PDAC preclinical models.
METHODS/DESIGN: VESPA is a patient-centric open label randomized multicenter 
phase-II investigator-initiated trial, evaluating the feasibility, safety, and 
efficacy of VPA/SIM plus first line gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel-based regimens 
(AG or PAXG) (experimental arm) versus chemotherapy alone (standard arm) in 
mPDAC patients. The study involves Italian and Spanish oncology centers and 
includes an initial 6-patients safety run-in-phase. A sample size of 240 
patients (120 for each arm) was calculated under the hypothesis that the 
addition of VPA/SIM to gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel-based regimens may extend 
progression free survival from 6 to 9 months in the experimental arm. Secondary 
endpoints are overall survival, response rate, disease control rate, duration of 
response, CA 19.9 reduction, toxicity, and quality of life. The study includes a 
patient engagement plan and complementary biomarkers studies on tumor and blood 
samples.
CONCLUSIONS: VESPA is the first trial evaluating efficacy and safety of two 
repurposed drugs in oncology such as VPA and SIM, in combination with standard 
chemotherapy, with the aim of improving mPDAC survival. The study is ongoing. 
Enrollment started in June 2023 and a total of 63 patients have been enrolled as 
of June 2024.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This article aims to identify epigenetic markers and 
detect early development of hematopoietic malignancies through an epigenome wide 
association study of DNA methylation data.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This register-based study includes 1,085 Danish twins 
with 31 hematopoietic malignancies and methylation levels from 450,154 
5'-C-phospate-G-3' (CpG) sites. Associations between methylation levels and 
incidence of hematopoietic malignancy is studied through time-to-event 
regression. The matched case-cotwin design, where one twin has a malignancy and 
the cotwin does not, is applied to enhance control for unmeasured shared 
confounding and false discoveries. Predictive performance is validated in the 
independent Older Finnish Twin Cohort.
RESULTS AND INTERPRETATION: We identified 67 epigenetic markers for 
hematopoietic malignancies of which 12 are linked to genes associated with 
hematologic malignancies. For some markers, we discovered a 2-3-fold relative 
risk difference for high versus low methylation. The identification of these 67 
sites enabled the formation of a predictor demonstrating a cross-validated 
time-varying area under the curve (AUC) of 92% 3 years after individual blood 
sampling and persistent performance above 70% up to 6 years after blood 
sampling. This predictive performance was to a large extent recovered in the 
validation sample showing an overall Harrell's C of 73%. In conclusion, from a 
large population representative twin study on hematopoietic cancers, novel 
epigenetic markers were identified that may prove useful for early diagnosis.

The N7-methylguanosine (m7G) modification and circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been 
shown to play important roles in the development of lung cancer. However, the 
m7G modification of circRNAs has not been fully elucidated. This study revealed 
the presence of the m7G modification in circFAM126A. We propose the novel 
hypothesis that the methyltransferase TRMT10C mediates the m7G modification of 
circFAM126A and that the stability of m7G-modified circFAM126A is reduced. 
circFAM126A is downregulated in lung cancer and significantly inhibits lung 
cancer growth both in vitro and in vivo. The expression of circFAM126A 
correlates with the stage of lung cancer and with the tumour diameter, and 
circFAM126A can be used as a potential molecular target for lung cancer. The 
molecular mechanism by which circFAM126A increases HSP90 ubiquitination and 
suppresses AKT1 expression to regulate cellular glycolysis, ultimately 
inhibiting the progression of lung cancer, is elucidated. This study not only 
broadens the knowledge regarding the expression and regulatory mode of circRNAs 
but also provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms that regulate 
tumour cell metabolism and affect tumour cell fate from an epigenetic 
perspective. These findings will facilitate the development of new strategies 
for lung cancer prevention and treatment.

BACKGROUND: Coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke have become the leading 
cause of premature mortality and morbidity worldwide. Therefore, sensitive and 
accurate biomarkers for early detection of CHD and stroke are urgently needed 
for effective prevention and treatment. We aim to investigate the association 
between blood-based HYAL2 methylation and the risk of CHD and stroke in Chinese 
population.
METHODS: In a prospective nested case-control study comprising 171 CHD cases, 
139 stroke cases, who developed the diseases after recruitment and 356 controls 
who remained healthy during the 2.5 years of follow-up time, the methylation 
level of HYAL2 in the peripheral blood was quantified using mass spectrometry, 
and the association was calculated by logistic regression adjusted for 
covariant.
RESULTS: Significant association between HYAL2 methylation in the peripheral 
blood and increased risk of preclinical CHD and stroke were identified [odds 
ratios (ORs) per - 10% methylation: 1.35-1.64, p ≤ 0.045 for HYAL2_CpG_1, 
HYAL2_CpG_2 and HYAL2_CpG_3 in CHD; ORs per - 10% methylation: 0.76-1.64, 
p ≤ 0.033 for HYAL2_CpG_2 and HYAL2_CpG_4 in stroke]. The association in CHD was 
further enhanced by female gender, younger age (< 70 years old), without the 
history of hypertension and cancer. The combination of four HYAL2 methylation 
sites showed an effective discrimination of CHD and stroke cases without 
hypertension from controls [area under curve (AUC) = 0.78 and 0.75, 
respectively].
CONCLUSIONS: This study presents a strong association of altered HYAL2 
methylation in peripheral blood with preclinical CHD and stroke, providing a 
novel biomarker for risk assessment and early detection of cardiovascular 
diseases.

Genome-wide association studies of colorectal cancer (CRC) have identified 170 
autosomal risk loci. However, for most of these, the functional variants and 
their target genes are unknown. Here, we perform statistical fine-mapping 
incorporating tissue-specific epigenetic annotations and massively parallel 
reporter assays to systematically prioritize functional variants for each CRC 
risk locus. We identify plausible causal variants for the 170 risk loci, with a 
single variant for 40. We link these variants to 208 target genes by analyzing 
colon-specific quantitative trait loci and implementing the activity-by-contact 
model, which integrates epigenomic features and Micro-C data, to predict 
enhancer-gene connections. By deciphering CRC risk loci, we identify direct 
links between risk variants and target genes, providing further insight into the 
molecular basis of CRC susceptibility and highlighting potential pharmaceutical 
targets for prevention and treatment.

BACKGROUND: Oral mucositis is a painful and debilitating condition that occurs 
in the majority of head and neck cancer patients receiving radiation and/or 
chemotherapy. While some patient and treatment related factors are known to 
contribute to the incidence and severity of disease, reliable biomarkers remain 
elusive. In the following study, we investigated the association of salivary DNA 
methylation derived biological aging, cellular frequency and protein 
concentration measures with the severity of oral mucositis and overall survival 
in a cohort of head and neck cancer (HNC) patients (n = 103).
METHODS: DNA methylation profiling was performed on saliva samples obtained 
prior to treatment. Biological aging measures included Horvath2, PhenoAge, 
FitAge and GrimAge, and cellular frequency included epithelial and specific 
immune cell populations.
RESULTS: Severe mucositis (i.e. grade 3 or 4) occurred in nearly half of 
patients. For malignant HNC patients (n = 84), every 1-SD increase in GrimAge 
was associated with 2.62-times risk of severe mucositis (95 % CI: 1.38, 5.57), 
while a 1-SD increase in monocyte frequency was associated with a decreased risk 
(OR [95 %CI]: 0.40 [0.18, 0.80]). Over a median follow-up of 53 months, 39 of 
103 participants died. Six protein scores (TNFSF14, GCSF, MATN3, GDF8, nCDase, 
TNF-β) were associated with survival at q < 0.15.
CONCLUSION: We provide evidence that the risk-related biological aging measure 
GrimAge may be a useful predictor of mucositis severity in HNC patients. 
Salivary monocyte frequency may be protective against mucositis, and this 
measure could be used as a predictive biomarker while also providing clues into 
the pathobiology of the disease.

BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), theseventh most common cancer 
worldwide, is characterized by a high mortality rate, advanced diagnosis, and 
susceptibility to extrahepatic metastasis. Numerous studies have shown that DNA 
methylation is a crucial factor in epigenetic modifications and regulation of 
carcinogenesis.
METHODS: HCC patient data were sourced from the TCGA dataset as a training set, 
while GSE116174 was used as an external validation set for verification. 
Differential methylation and expression analyses were performed on HCC samples 
with and without extrahepatic metastasis. In the intersecting genes, the 
relationship between methylation and expression levels of the intersecting genes 
was analyzed. Genes with a correlation coefficient≥|0.30| and P<0.05 were 
identified as methylation driver genes. Cox regression analysis was conducted to 
identify genes associated with HCC prognosis and establish a risk score. 
Subsequently, a prognostic model was established and validated using Cox 
regression analysis incorporating the risk score and other clinical factors. 
Using immunohistochemistry to evaluate the expression of DHX58 and EIF5A2 in HCC 
tissues with and without extrahepatic metastasis. Immunoinfiltration analysis 
was performed on the HCC samples using CIBERSORT.
RESULTS: Our research identified eight methylation driver genes for HCC 
extrahepatic metastasis, of which two genes (DHX58 and EIF5A2) were associated 
with HCC patient prognosis. And the study further constructed and validated the 
risk score and prognostic model. Immunoinfiltration analysis showed that M0 
macrophage abundance was correlated with the prognosis of HCC patients. 
Immunohistochemistry revealed differences in DHX58 and EIF5A2 expression between 
HCC tissues with and without extrahepatic metastasis, consistent with our 
bioinformatics findings.

BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer, encompassing squamous cell carcinoma and 
endocervical adenocarcinoma (CESC), presents a considerable risk to the 
well-being of women. Recent studies have reported that squalene epoxidase (SQLE) 
is overexpressed in several cancers, which contributes to cancer development.
METHODS: RNA sequencing data for SQLE were obtained from The Cancer Genome 
Atlas. In vitro experiments, including colorimetry, colony formation, Transwell, 
RT-qPCR, and Western blotting were performed. Furthermore, a transplanted CESC 
nude mouse model was constructed to validate the tumorigenic activity of SQLE in 
vivo. Associations among the SQLE expression profiles, differentially expressed 
genes (DEGs), immune infiltration, and chemosensitivity were examined. The 
prognostic value of genetic changes and DNA methylation in SQLE were also 
assessed.
RESULTS: SQLE mRNA expression was significantly increased in CESC. ROC analysis 
revealed the strong diagnostic ability of SQLE toward CESC. Patients with high 
SQLE expression experienced shorter overall survival. The promotional effects of 
SQLE on cancer cell proliferation, metastasis, cholesterol synthesis, and EMT 
were emphasized. DEGs functional enrichment analysis revealed the signaling 
pathways and biological processes. Notably, a connection existed between the 
SQLE expression and the presence of immune cells as well as the activation of 
immune checkpoints. Increased SQLE expressions exhibited increased 
chemotherapeutic responses. SQLE methylation status was significantly associated 
with CESC prognosis.
CONCLUSION: SQLE significantly affects CESC prognosis, malignant behavior, 
cholesterol synthesis, EMT, and immune infiltration; thereby offering diagnostic 
and indicator roles in CESC. Thus, SQLE can be a novel therapeutic target in 
CESC treatment.

High dietary sugar (HDS), a contemporary dietary concern due to excessive intake 
of added sugars and carbohydrates, escalates the risk of metabolic disorders and 
concomitant cancers. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying HDS-induced 
cancer progression are not completely understood. We found that 
phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (PEPCK1), a pivotal enzyme in 
gluconeogenesis, is paradoxically upregulated in tumors by HDS, but not by 
normal dietary sugar (NDS), during tumor progression. Targeted knockdown of 
pepck1, but not pepck2, specifically in tumor tissue in Drosophila in vivo, not 
only attenuates HDS-induced tumor growth but also significantly improves the 
survival of Ras/Src tumor-bearing animals fed HDS. Interestingly, HP1a-mediated 
heterochromatin interacts directly with the pepck1 gene and downregulates pepck1 
gene expression in wild-type Drosophila. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that, 
under HDS conditions, pepck1 knockdown reduces both wingless and TOR signaling, 
decreases evasion of apoptosis, reduces genome instability, and suppresses 
glucose uptake and trehalose levels in tumor cells in vivo. Moreover, rational 
pharmacological inhibition of PEPCK1, using hydrazinium sulfate, greatly 
improves the survival of tumor-bearing animals with pepck1 knockdown under HDS. 
This study is the first to show that elevated levels of dietary sugar induce 
aberrant upregulation of PEPCK1, which promotes tumor progression through 
altered cell signaling, evasion of apoptosis, genome instability, and 
reprogramming of carbohydrate metabolism. These findings contribute to our 
understanding of the complex relationship between diet and cancer at the 
molecular, cellular, and organismal levels and reveal PEPCK1 as a potential 
target for the prevention and treatment of cancers associated with metabolic 
disorders.

BACKGROUND: Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is associated with a high mortality rate. 
Asian American (AsA) are among the fastest-growing populations in the United 
States, yet little is known about the disparity of GBC within this cohort. This 
study identified trends in treatment and outcomes for GBC in a disaggregated 
fashion, specifically for this population.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the National Cancer Database (NCDB) between 
2010 and 2019 examining all patients treated for gallbladder cancer was 
performed. Basic demographic factors were identified for patients of Caucasian, 
African American, and disaggregated Asian subpopulations. Survival curves were 
used to identify differences in median overall survival, and a multivariate 
analysis was performed to determine which factors impact overall survival.
RESULTS: A total of 1317 (5%) patients were of AsA origin. Median survival for 
the overall AsA population is 15.1 months compared with Caucasian (11.5 months) 
and African Americans (11.4 months) (p < 0.0001). Within the AsA groups, the 
Korean subpopulation had the lowest survival at 12.6 months, whereas Filipinos 
had the longest survival at 19.1 months (p < 0.0001). Patients of Filipino 
descent had the highest rate of surgical resection but lower chemotherapy 
utilization. Conversely, Korean patients had the highest utilization of 
multimodality therapy. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that belonging to 
Chinese, Filipino, or Indian ethnicity was associated with decreased risk of 
mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: There are disparate differences in survival for patients with GBC 
between AsA groups. Socioeconomic, genetic, and epigenetic factors may influence 
these differences. Further research is needed to delineate the causes of this 
disparity.

A differential diet with royal jelly (RJ) during early larval development in 
honeybees shapes the phenotype, which is probably mediated by epigenetic 
regulation of gene expression. Evidence indicates that small molecules in RJ can 
modulate gene expression in mammalian cells, such as the fatty acid 
10-hydroxy-2-decenoic acid (10-HDA), previously associated with the inhibition 
of histone deacetylase enzymes (HDACs). Therefore, we combined computational 
(molecular docking simulations) and experimental approaches for the screening of 
potential HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) among 32 RJ-derived fatty acids. Biochemical 
assays and gene expression analyses (Reverse Transcriptase - quantitative 
Polymerase Chain Reaction) were performed to evaluate the functional effects of 
the major RJ fatty acids, 10-HDA and 10-HDAA (10-hydroxy-decanoic acid), in two 
human cancer cell lines (HCT116 and MDA-MB-231). The molecular docking 
simulations indicate that these fatty acids might interact with class I HDACs, 
specifically with the catalytic domain of human HDAC2, likewise well-known HDAC 
inhibitors (HDACi) such as SAHA (suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid) and TSA 
(Trichostatin A). In addition, the combined treatment with 10-HDA and 10-HDAA 
inhibits the activity of human nuclear HDACs and leads to a slight increase in 
the expression of HDAC-coding genes in cancer cells. Our findings indicate that 
royal jelly fatty acids collectively contribute to HDAC inhibition and that 
10-HDA and 10-HDAA are weak HDACi that facilitate the acetylation of lysine 
residues of chromatin, triggering an increase in gene expression levels in 
cancer cells.

Childhood neuroblastoma with MYCN amplification is classified as high risk and 
often relapses after intensive treatments. Immune checkpoint blockade therapy 
against the PD-1/L1 axis shows limited efficacy in patients with neuroblastoma, 
and the cancer intrinsic immune regulatory network is poorly understood. Here, 
we leverage genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screens and identify H2AFY as a resistance 
gene to the clinically approved PD-1 blocking antibody nivolumab. Analysis of 
single-cell RNA-Seq datasets reveals that H2AFY mRNA is enriched in adrenergic 
cancer cells and is associated with worse patient survival. Genetic deletion of 
H2afy in MYCN-driven neuroblastoma cells reverts in vivo resistance to PD-1 
blockade by eliciting activation of the adaptive and innate immunity. Mapping of 
the epigenetic and translational landscape demonstrates that H2afy deletion 
promotes cell transition to a mesenchymal-like state. With a multiomics 
approach, we uncovered H2AFY-associated genes that are functionally relevant and 
prognostic in patients. Altogether, our study elucidates the role of H2AFY as an 
epigenetic gatekeeper for cell states and immunogenicity in high-risk 
neuroblastoma.

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) constitutes a significant portion of lung 
cancers and cytotoxic drugs (e.g. cisplatin) are currently the first-line 
treatment. However, NSCLC has developed resistance to this drug, which limits 
the therapeutic effect and thus affects prognosis. NSCLC sc-RNA-seq data were 
downloaded from the GEO database and Ku Leuven Laboratory for Functional 
Epigenetics, and bulk RNA-seq data were obtained from the TCGA database. The 
""Seurat"" package was employed for scRNA-seq data processing, and the uniform 
manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) were applied for downscaling and 
cluster identification. Use the FindAllMarkers function to find differential 
genes (DEGs) for tumor stem cells. Then, we performed univariate regression 
analyses on the DEGs to identify potential prognostic genes. We created a 
machine learning framework based on potential prognostic genes, which combines 
10 machine learning methods and their 101 combinations to get the optimal 
prognostic risk model. The model was evaluated in the training set and 
validation set. A nomogram was developed to provide physicians with a 
quantitative tool for prognosis prediction. Finally, we evaluated the expression 
and functionality of SLC2A1. We discovered 22 cell clusters containing 218379 
cells by examining single-cell RNA sequencing datasets (GSE148071, KU_lom, 
GSE131907, GSE136246, GSE127465). Tumour cells were isolated for subpopulation 
analysis and 162 differential genes from SOX2_cancer were obtained. After 
univariate Cox analysis, we found 23 genes with prognostic potential prognostic 
value and utilized them to develop 101‑combination machine learning 
computational framework. We eventually picked the best performing 
'StepCox[both] + RSF', which includes 8 genes. The model has a relatively high 
prediction accuracy in both TCGA and GEO datasets. In in vitro investigations, 
targeted suppression of the SLC2A1 gene resulted in significant reductions in 
proliferation, invasion and migration in A549 cells. In addition, a significant 
reduction in cisplatin resistance was seen in A549/DDP cells. The outcomes 
demonstrated the precision and credibility of the prognostic model for NSCLC, 
highlighting its potential significance in the treatment and prognosis of 
individuals affected by this disease. SLC2A1 may become a promising prognostic 
marker and a potential therapeutic target, offering valuable insights to inform 
clinical treatment decisions.

Human pancreatic cancer is characterized by the molecular diversity encompassing 
native duct-like and squamous cell-like identities, but mechanisms underlying 
squamous transdifferentiation have remained elusive. To comprehensively capture 
the molecular diversity of human pancreatic cancer, we here profiled 65 
patient-derived pancreatic cancer organoid lines, including six adenosquamous 
carcinoma lines. H3K27me3-mediated erasure of the ductal lineage specifiers and 
hijacking of the TP63-driven squamous-cell programme drove squamous-cell 
commitment, providing survival benefit in a Wnt-deficient environment and 
hypoxic conditions. Gene engineering of normal pancreatic duct organoids 
revealed that GATA6 loss and a Wnt-deficient environment, in concert with 
genetic or hypoxia-mediated inactivation of KDM6A, facilitate squamous 
reprogramming, which in turn enhances environmental fitness. EZH2 inhibition 
counterbalanced the epigenetic bias and curbed the growth of adenosquamous 
cancer organoids. Our results demonstrate how an adversarial microenvironment 
dictates the molecular and histological evolution of human pancreatic cancer and 
provide insights into the principles and significance of lineage conversion in 
human cancer.

MOTIVATION: There exists an unexplained diverse variation within the predefined 
colon cancer stages using only features from either genomics or 
histopathological whole slide images as prognostic factors. Unraveling this 
variation will bring about improved staging and treatment outcomes. Hence, 
motivated by the advancement of Deep Neural Network (DNN) libraries and 
complementary factors within some genomics datasets, we aggregate atypia 
patterns in histopathological images with diverse carcinogenic expression from 
mRNA, miRNA and DNA methylation as an integrative input source into a deep 
neural network for colon cancer stages classification, and samples 
stratification into low or high-risk survival groups.
RESULTS: The genomics-only and integrated input features return Area Under 
Curve-Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.97 compared with 
AUC-ROC of 0.78 obtained when only image features are used for the stage's 
classification. A further analysis of prediction accuracy using the confusion 
matrix shows that the integrated features have a weakly improved accuracy of 
0.08% more than the accuracy obtained with genomics features. Also, the 
extracted features were used to split the patients into low or high-risk 
survival groups. Among the 2,700 fused features, 1,836 (68%) features showed 
statistically significant survival probability differences in aggregating 
samples into either low or high between the two risk survival groups.

BACKGROUND: N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is one of the most common forms of mRNA 
modification, which is dynamically regulated by the m6A-related genes; however, 
its effect in glioblastoma (GBM) is still unknown.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate the association between m6A-related genes 
(m6A-RGs) and GBM.
METHODS: Transcriptome data and the relevant clinical data were downloaded from 
The Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus databases. The m6A-RGs were 
identified from differently expressed genes, and COX and lasso regression models 
were applied to locate the prognosis-related genes.
RESULTS: We identified 15 out of 19 m6A-RGs differentially expressed between GBM 
and nontumor tissues. We identified two subgroups of GBM (clusters 1 and 2) by 
applying consensus clustering. Compared with the cluster 1 subgroup, the cluster 
1 subgroup correlates with a poorer prognosis, and most of the 19 m6A-RGs are 
higher expressed in cluster 1. Through univariate Cox and lasso regression 
model, we identified three m6A-RGs, namely HNRNPC, ALKBH5, and FTO, which were 
used to construct a Cox regression risk model to predict the prognosis of GBM 
patients.
CONCLUSION: We identified a valuable m6A model for predicting the prognosis of 
GBM patients, which can provide useful epigenetic biomarkers.

Chronic liver disease and cancer are global health challenges. The role of the 
circadian clock as a regulator of liver physiology and disease is well 
established in rodents, however, the identity and epigenetic regulation of 
rhythmically expressed genes in human disease is less well studied. Here we 
unravel the rhythmic transcriptome and epigenome of human hepatocytes using male 
human liver chimeric mice. We identify a large number of rhythmically expressed 
protein coding genes in human hepatocytes of male chimeric mice, which includes 
key transcription factors, chromatin modifiers, and critical enzymes. We show 
that hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, a major cause of liver disease and 
cancer, perturbs the transcriptome by altering the rhythmicity of the expression 
of more than 1000 genes, and affects the epigenome, leading to an activation of 
critical pathways mediating metabolic alterations, fibrosis, and cancer. 
HCV-perturbed rhythmic pathways remain dysregulated in patients with advanced 
liver disease. Collectively, these data support a role for virus-induced 
perturbation of the hepatic rhythmic transcriptome and pathways in cancer 
development and may provide opportunities for cancer prevention and biomarkers 
to predict HCC risk.

Cellular senescence is widely acknowledged as having strong associations with 
cancer. However, the intricate relationships between cellular senescence-related 
(CSR) genes and cancer risk remain poorly explored, with insights on causality 
remaining elusive. In this study, Mendelian Randomization (MR) analyses were 
used to draw causal inferences from 866 CSR genes as exposures and summary 
statistics for 18 common cancers as outcomes. We focused on genetic variants 
affecting gene expression, DNA methylation, and protein expression quantitative 
trait loci (cis-eQTL, cis-mQTL, and cis-pQTL, respectively), which were strongly 
linked to CSR genes alterations. Variants were selected as instrumental 
variables (IVs) and analyzed for causality with cancer using both 
summary-data-based MR (SMR) and two-sample MR (TSMR) approaches. Bayesian 
colocalization was used to unravel potential regulatory mechanisms underpinning 
risk variants in cancer, and further validate the robustness of MR results. We 
identified five CSR genes (CNOT6, DNMT3B, MAP2K1, TBPL1, and SREBF1), 18 DNA 
methylation genes, and LAYN protein expression which were all causally 
associated with different cancer types. Beyond causality, a comprehensive 
analysis of gene function, pathways, and druggability values was also conducted. 
These findings provide a robust foundation for unravelling CSR genes molecular 
mechanisms and promoting clinical drug development for cancer.

The alarming increase in global rates of metabolic diseases (MetDs) and their 
association with cancer risk renders them a considerable burden on our society. 
The interplay of environmental and genetic factors in causing MetDs may be 
reflected in DNA methylation patterns, particularly at non-canonical (non-B) DNA 
structures, such as G-quadruplexes (G4s) or R-loops. To gain insight into the 
mechanisms of MetD progression, we focused on DNA methylation and functional 
analyses on intragenic regions of two MetD risk genes, the glucokinase (GCK) 
exon 7 and the transmembrane 6 superfamily 2 (TM6SF2) intron 2-exon 3 boundary, 
which harbor non-B DNA motifs for G4s and R-loops.Pyrosequencing of 148 blood 
samples from a nested cohort study revealed significant differential methylation 
in GCK and TM6SF2 in MetD patients versus healthy controls. Furthermore, these 
regions harbor hypervariable and differentially methylated CpGs also in 
hepatocellular carcinoma versus normal tissue samples from The Cancer Genome 
Atlas (TCGA). Permanganate/S1 nuclease footprinting with direct adapter ligation 
(PDAL-Seq), native polyacrylamide DNA gel electrophoresis and circular dichroism 
(CD) spectroscopy revealed the formation of G4 structures in these regions and 
demonstrated that their topology and stability is affected by DNA methylation. 
Detailed analyses including histone marks, chromatin conformation capture data, 
and luciferase reporter assays, highlighted the cell-type specific regulatory 
function of the target regions. Based on our analyses, we hypothesize that 
changes in DNA methylation lead to topological changes, especially in GCK exon 
7, and cause the activation of alternative regulatory elements or potentially 
play a role in alternative splicing.Our analyses provide a new view on the 
mechanisms underlying the progression of MetDs and their link to hepatocellular 
carcinomas, unveiling non-B DNA structures as important key players already in 
early disease stages.

Biological age, reflecting the cumulative damage in the body over a lifespan, is 
a dynamic measure more indicative of individual health than chronological age. 
Accelerated aging, when biological age surpasses chronological age, is 
implicated in poorer clinical outcomes, especially for breast cancer (BC) 
survivors undergoing treatments. This preliminary study investigates the impact 
of a 16-week online supervised physical activity (PA) intervention on biological 
age in post-surgery female BC patients. Telomere length was measured using qPCR, 
and the ELOVL2-based epigenetic clock was assessed via DNA methylation 
pyrosequencing of the ELOVL2 promoter region. Telomere length remained 
unchanged, but the ELOVL2 epigenetic clock indicated a significant decrease in 
biological age in the PA group, suggesting the potential of PA interventions to 
reverse accelerated aging processes in BC survivors. The exercise group showed 
improved cardiovascular fitness, highlighting PA's health impact. Finally, the 
reduction in biological age, as measured by the ELOVL2 epigenetic clock, was 
significantly associated with improvements in cardiovascular fitness and 
handgrip strength, supporting improved recovery. Epigenetic clocks can 
potentially assess health status and recovery progress in BC patients, 
identifying at-risk individuals in clinical practice. This study provides 
potential and valuable insights into how PA benefits BC survivors' health, 
supporting the immediate benefits of a 16-week exercise intervention in 
mitigating accelerated aging. The findings could suggest a holistic approach to 
improving the health and recovery of post-surgery BC patients.

CD8+ T cells control tumors but inevitably become dysfunctional in the tumor 
microenvironment. Here, we show that sodium chloride (NaCl) counteracts T cell 
dysfunction to promote cancer regression. NaCl supplementation during CD8+ 
T cell culture induced effector differentiation, IFN-γ production and 
cytotoxicity while maintaining the gene networks responsible for stem-like 
plasticity. Accordingly, adoptive transfer of tumor-specific T cells resulted in 
superior anti-tumor immunity in a humanized mouse model. In mice, a high-salt 
diet reduced the growth of experimental tumors in a CD8+ T cell-dependent manner 
by inhibiting terminal differentiation and enhancing the effector potency of 
CD8+ T cells. Mechanistically, NaCl enhanced glutamine consumption, which was 
critical for transcriptional, epigenetic and functional reprogramming. In 
humans, CD8+ T cells undergoing antigen recognition in tumors and predicting 
favorable responses to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy resembled those induced 
by NaCl. Thus, NaCl metabolism is a regulator of CD8+ T cell effector function, 
with potential implications for cancer immunotherapy.

Benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) or benzo (a) pyrene 7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-epoxide (BPDE) 
exposure causes trophoblast cell dysfunctions and induces miscarriage, which is 
generally epigenetically regulated. Homologous recombination (HR) repair of DNA 
double strand break (DSB) plays a crucial role in maintenance of genetic 
stability and cell normal functions. However, whether BaP/BPDE might suppress HR 
repair in human trophoblast cells to induce miscarriage, as well as its 
epigenetic regulatory mechanism, is largely unclear. In this study, we find that 
BaP/BPDE suppresses HR repair of DSB in trophoblast cells and eventually induces 
miscarriage by up-regulating lnc-HZ08. In mechanism, lnc-HZ08 (1) down-regulates 
the expression levels of FOXA1 (forkhead box A1) and thus suppresses 
FOXA1-mediated mRNA transcription of BRCA1 (Breast cancer susceptibility gene 1) 
and CtIP (CtBP-interacting protein), (2) impairs BRCA1 and CtIP protein 
interactions by competitive binding with CtIP through lnc-HZ08-1 fragment, and 
also (3) suppresses BRCA1-mediated CtIP ubiquitination without affecting CtIP 
stability, three of which eventually suppress HR repair in human trophoblast 
cells. Supplement with murine Ctip could efficiently restore (i.e. increase) HR 
repair and alleviate miscarriage in BaP-exposed mouse model. Collectively, this 
study not only reveals the association and causality among BaP/BPDE exposure, 
the defective HR repair, and miscarriage, but also discovers novel mechanism in 
lnc-HZ08-regulated BRCA1/CtIP-mediated HR repair, bridging epigenetic regulation 
and genetic instability and also providing an efficient approach for treatment 
against BaP/BPDE-induced unexplained miscarriage.

BACKGROUND: p63 is a transcription factor with intrinsic pioneer factor activity 
and pleiotropic functions. Transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) signaling via 
activation and cooperative action of canonical, SMAD, and non-canonical, 
MAP-kinase (MAPK) pathways, elicits both anti- and pro-tumorigenic properties, 
including cell stemness and invasiveness. TGFβ activates the ΔNp63 
transcriptional program in cancer cells; however, the link between TGFβ and p63 
in unmasking the epigenetic landscape during tumor progression allowing 
chromatin accessibility and gene transcription, is not yet reported.
METHODS: Small molecule inhibitors, including protein kinase inhibitors and 
RNA-silencing, provided loss of function analyses. Sphere formation assays in 
cancer cells, chromatin immunoprecipitation and mRNA expression assays were 
utilized in order to gain mechanistic evidence. Mass spectrometry analysis 
coupled to co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed novel p63 interactors and 
their involvement in p63-dependent transcription.
RESULTS: The sphere-forming capacity of breast cancer cells was enhanced upon 
TGFβ stimulation and significantly decreased upon ΔNp63 depletion. Activation of 
TGFβ signaling via p38 MAPK signaling induced ΔNp63 phosphorylation at Ser 66/68 
resulting in stabilized ΔNp63 protein with enhanced DNA binding properties. TGFβ 
stimulation altered the ratio of H3K27ac and H3K27me3 histone modification 
marks, pointing towards higher H3K27ac and increased p300 acetyltransferase 
recruitment to chromatin. By silencing the expression of ΔNp63, the TGFβ effect 
on chromatin remodeling was abrogated. Inhibition of H3K27me3, revealed the 
important role of TGFβ as the upstream signal for guiding ΔNp63 to the TGFβ/SMAD 
gene loci, as well as the indispensable role of ΔNp63 in recruiting histone 
modifying enzymes, such as p300, to these genomic regions, regulating chromatin 
accessibility and gene transcription. Mechanistically, TGFβ through SMAD 
activation induced dissociation of ΔNp63 from NURD or NCOR/SMRT histone 
deacetylation complexes, while promoted the assembly of ΔNp63-p300 complexes, 
affecting the levels of histone acetylation and the outcome of ΔNp63-dependent 
transcription.
CONCLUSIONS: ΔNp63, phosphorylated and recruited by TGFβ to the TGFβ/SMAD/ΔNp63 
gene loci, promotes chromatin accessibility and transcription of target genes 
related to stemness and cell invasion.

Early detection of recurrent cervical cancer is important to improve survival 
rates. The aim of this study was to explore the clinical performance of DNA 
methylation markers and high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) in cervicovaginal 
self-samples and urine for the detection of recurrent cervical cancer. Cervical 
cancer patients without recurrence (n = 47) collected cervicovaginal 
self-samples and urine pre- and posttreatment. Additionally, 20 patients with 
recurrent cervical cancer collected cervicovaginal self-samples and urine at 
time of recurrence. All samples were self-collected at home and tested for DNA 
methylation and high-risk HPV DNA by PCR. In patients without recurrent cervical 
cancer, DNA methylation levels decreased 2-years posttreatment compared to 
pretreatment in cervicovaginal self-samples (p < .0001) and urine (p < .0001). 
DNA methylation positivity in cervicovaginal self-samples was more frequently 
observed in patients with recurrence (77.8%) than in patients without recurrence 
2-years posttreatment (25.5%; p = .0004). Also in urine, DNA methylation 
positivity was more frequently observed in patients with recurrence (65%) 
compared to those without recurrence (35.6%; p = .038). Similarly, high-risk HPV 
positivity in both cervicovaginal self-samples and urine was more frequent 
(52.6% and 55%, respectively) in patients with recurrence compared to patients 
without recurrence (14.9% and 8.5%, respectively) (p = .004 and p = .0001). In 
conclusion, this study shows the potential of posttreatment monitoring of 
cervical cancer patients for recurrence by DNA methylation and high-risk HPV 
testing in cervicovaginal and urine samples collected at home. The highest 
recurrence detection rate was achieved by DNA methylation testing in 
cervicovaginal self-samples, detecting 77.8% of all recurrences and, 
specifically, 100% of the local recurrences.

BACKGROUND: Early gastric cancer is treated endoscopically, but patients require 
surveillance due to the risk of metachronous gastric lesions (MGLs). Epigenetic 
alterations, particularly aberrant DNA methylation in genes, such as MIR124-3, 
MIR34b/c, NKX6-1, EMX1, MOS and CDO1, have been identified as promising 
biomarkers for MGL in Asian populations. We aimed to determine whether these 
changes could predict MGL risk in intermediate-risk Caucasian patients.
METHODS: This case-cohort study included 36 patients who developed MGL matched 
to 48 patients without evidence of MGL in the same time frame (controls). 
Multiplex quantitative methylation-specific PCR was performed using DNA 
extracted from the normal mucosa adjacent to the primary lesion. The overall 
risk of progression to MGL was assessed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional 
hazards model analyses.
RESULTS: MIR124-3, MIR34b/c and NKX6-1 were successfully analyzed in 77 samples. 
MIR124-3 hypermethylation was detected in individuals who developed MGL 
(relative quantification 78.8 vs 50.5 in controls, p = 0.014), particularly in 
females and Helicobacter pylori-negative patients (p = 0.021 and p = 0.0079, 
respectively). This finding was further associated with a significantly greater 
risk for MGL development (aHR = 2.31, 95% CI 1.03-5.17, p = 0.042). Similarly, 
NKX6-1 was found to be hypermethylated in patients with synchronous lesions 
(relative quantification 7.9 vs 0.0 in controls, p = 0.0026). A molecular-based 
methylation model incorporating both genes was significantly associated with a 
threefold increased risk for MGL development (aHR = 3.10, 95% CI 1.07-8.95, 
p = 0.037).
CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary study revealed an association between MIR124-3 and 
NKX6-1 hypermethylation and the development of MGL in a Western population. 
These findings may represent a burden reduction and a greener approach to 
patient care.

BACKGROUND: Current research on the epigenetic repercussions of exposure to a 
combination of pollutants is limited. This study aims to discern DNA methylation 
probes associated with exposure to multiple pollutants, serving as early effect 
markers, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as surrogate indicators for 
population susceptibility. The investigation involved the analysis of urine 
exposure biomarkers for 11 heavy metals (vanadium, arsenic, mercury, cadmium, 
chromium, nickel, lead, manganese, copper, strontium, thallium), polycyclic 
aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs) (1-hydroxypyrene), genome-wide DNA methylation 
sequencing, and SNPs array on all study participants. The data were integrated 
with metabolomics information and analyzed both at a community level based on 
proximity to home addresses relative to the complex and at an individual level 
based on exposure biomarker concentrations.
RESULTS: On a community level, 67 exposure-related CpG probes were identified, 
while 70 CpG probes were associated with urine arsenic concentration, 2 with 
mercury, and 46 with vanadium on an individual level. These probes were 
annotated to genes implicated in cancers and chronic kidney disease. Weighted 
quantile sum regression analysis revealed that vanadium, mercury, and 
1-hydroxypyrene contributed the most to cg08238319 hypomethylation. cg08238319 
is annotated to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor (AHRR) gene, and AHRR 
hypomethylation was correlated with an elevated risk of lung cancer. AHRR was 
further linked to deregulations in phenylalanine metabolism, alanine, aspartate, 
and glutamate metabolism, along with heightened oxidative stress. Additionally, 
three SNPs (rs11085020, rs199442, and rs10947050) corresponding to 
exposure-related CpG probes exhibited significant interaction effects with 
multiple heavy metals and PAHs exposure, and have been implicated in cancer 
progression and respiratory diseases.
CONCLUSION: Our findings underscore the pivotal role of AHRR methylation in 
gene-environment interactions and highlight SNPs that could potentially serve as 
indicators of population susceptibility in regions exposed to multiple heavy 
metals and PAHs.

INTRODUCTION: Men with African ancestry have the highest incidence and mortality 
rates of prostate cancer (PCa) worldwide.
METHODS: This study aimed to identify differentially methylated genes between 
tumor vs. adjacent normal and aggressive vs. indolent PCa in 121 African 
American patients. Epigenome-wide DNA methylation patterns in tumor DNA were 
assessed using the human Illumina Methylation EPIC V1 array.
RESULTS: Around 5,139 differentially methylated CpG-sites (q < 0.01, lΔβl > 0.2) 
were identified when comparing normal vs. tumor, with an overall trend of 
hypermethylation in prostate tumors.  Multiple representative differentially 
methylated regions (DMRs), including immune-related genes, such as CD40, 
Galectin3, OX40L, and STING, were detected in prostate tumors when compared to 
adjacent normal tissues. Based on an epigenetic clock model, we observed that 
tumors' total number of stem cell divisions and the stem cell division rate were 
significantly higher than adjacent normal tissues. Regarding PCa aggressiveness, 
2,061 differentially methylated CpG-sites (q < 0.05, lΔβl > .05) were identified 
when the grade group (GG)1 was compared with GG4/5. Among these 2,061 CpG sites, 
155 probes were consistently significant in more than one comparison. Among 
these genes, several immune system genes, such as COL18A1, S100A2, ITGA4, HLA-C, 
and ADCYAP1, have previously been linked to tumor progression in PCa.
CONCLUSION: Several differentially methylated genes involved in immune-oncologic 
pathways associated with disease risk or aggressiveness were identified. In 
addition, 261 African American-specific differentially methylated genes related 
to the risk of PCa were identified. These results can shedlight on potential 
mechanisms contributing to PCa disparities in the African American Population.

BACKGROUND: HPV-16 infection and viral-host integration are the most important 
risk factors for cervical cancer (CC). The aim of this study is to develop a new 
molecular strategy integrated both the viral and host genome variations 
identifying and monitoring CC.
METHOD: A total of 312 methylation and 538 RNA-seq datasets were collected from 
public databases to identify differentially methylated and expressed genes. HPV 
associated virus integration sites (VISs) were analysed using the ViMIC 
database. From September 2020 to August 2021, the 70 HPV-16 positive cases 
retrospectively collected from multi-centre cohorts were subjected to HPV-16 E6 
deep sequencing and PCR-based host gene (ASTN1, DLX1, ITGA4, RXFP3, SOX17, 
ZNF671) methylation detection. RNAseq and expression validation (NNF671) were 
performed in C-33A cell line harbouring HPV D32E. Lasso and logistic regression 
algorithm were used to construct the CC diagnostic model.
RESULTS: A positive correlation was observed between the average methylation 
level of CC patients and their pathological features including tumour stage 
(p = 0.0077) and HPV subtype (p < 0.001). ZNF671 was identified as a CC-specific 
methylation marker, with an impressive 93% sensitivity. Both HPV-16 D32E 
mutation and integration of HPV-16 down-regulated the ZNF671 expression. 
Finally, a CC diagnostic nomogram was developed by integrating ZNF671 
methylation level and HPV E6 mutation feature, yielding an exceptional AUC of 
0.997 (95% CI: 0.934-1.000).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated HPV viral mutations are closely related to 
host gene epigenetic alterations in CC. Integration of the viral and host 
genetic information might be a new promising strategy for CC screening.

The calcium-binding protein S100A9 has emerged as a pivotal biomolecular actor 
in oncology, implicated in numerous malignancies. This comprehensive 
bioinformatics study transcends traditional boundaries, investigating the 
prognostic and therapeutic potential of S100A9 across diverse neoplastic 
entities. Leveraging a wide array of bioinformatics tools and publicly available 
cancer genomics databases, such as TCGA, we systematically examined the S100A9 
gene. Our approach included differential expression analysis, mutational burden 
assessment, protein interaction networks, and survival analysis. This robust 
computational framework provided a high-resolution view of S100A9's role in 
cancer biology. The study meticulously explored S100A9's oncogenic facets, 
incorporating comprehensive analyses of its relationship with prognosis, tumor 
mutational burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI), DNA methylation, and 
immune cell infiltration across various tumor types. This study presents a 
panoramic view of S100A9 expression across a spectrum of human cancers, 
revealing a heterogeneous expression landscape. Elevated S100A9 expression was 
detected in malignancies such as BLCA (Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma), CESC 
(Cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma), COAD (Colon 
adenocarcinoma), ESCA (Esophageal carcinoma), and GBM (Glioblastoma multiforme), 
while reduced expression was noted in BRCA (Breast invasive carcinoma), HNSC 
(Head and Neck squamous cell carcinoma), and KICH (Kidney Chromophobe). This 
disparate expression pattern suggests that S100A9's role in cancer biology is 
multifaceted and context-dependent. Prognostically, S100A9 expression correlates 
variably with patient outcomes across different cancer types. Furthermore, its 
expression is intricately associated with TMB and MSI in nine cancer types. 
Detailed examination of six selected tumors-BRCA, CESC, KIRC (Kidney renal clear 
cell carcinoma), LUSC (Lung squamous cell carcinoma), SKCM (Skin Cutaneous 
Melanoma); STAD (Stomach adenocarcinoma)-revealed a negative correlation of 
S100A9 expression with the infiltration of most immune cells, but a positive 
correlation with neutrophils, M1 macrophages, and activated NK cells, 
highlighting the complex interplay between S100A9 and the tumor immune 
environment. This bioinformatics synthesis posits S100A9 as a significant player 
in cancer progression, offering valuable prognostic insights. The data 
underscore the utility of S100A9 as a prognostic biomarker and its potential as 
a therapeutic target. The therapeutic implications are profound, suggesting that 
modulation of S100A9 activity could significantly impact cancer management 
strategies.

OBJECTIVES: In this study, we aimed to validate the performance of the PAX1 and 
JAM3 methylation (PAX1m/JAM3m) test as a triage tool for detecting cervical 
intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 or worse (CIN3 +) in non-16/18 high-risk human 
papillomavirus-positive patients (non-16/18 hrHPV +).
METHODS: The triage performance of liquid-based cytology (LBC) and the 
PAX1m/JAM3m test for detecting CIN3 + were compared.
RESULTS: In total, 1851 participants had cervical histological outcomes and were 
included in the analysis. The sensitivity/specificity of the LBC test results 
with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance or worse (LBC ≥ ASCUS) 
and the PAX1m/JAM3m test were 90.1%/26.7% and 84.8%/88.5%, respectively. 
PAX1m/JAM3m( +) had the highest diagnostic AUC (0.866, 95% confidence interval 
(CI) 0.837-0.896) in the whole cohort. All cancers (n = 20) were detected by 
PAX1m/JAM3m(+). Compared with LBC ≥ ASCUS, PAX1m/JAM3m(+) reduced the number of 
patients who needed referral for colposcopy by 57.21% (74.66% vs. 17.45%). The 
odds ratios for detecting CIN3 + by LBC ≥ ASCUS and PAX1m/JAM3m(+) were 3.3 (95% 
CI 2.0-5.9) and 42.6 (27.1-69.6), respectively (p < 0.001). The combination of 
LBC ≥ ASCUS or PAX1m/JAM3m(+) slightly increased the diagnostic sensitivity 
(98.0%, 95% CI: 95.8-100%) and referral rate (77.09%) but reduced the diagnostic 
specificity (24.8%, 22.7-26.8%).
CONCLUSIONS: In non-16/18 hrHPV(+) women, PAX1m/JAM3m was superior to cytology 
for detecting CIN3 + . Compared with LBC ≥ ASCUS, PAX1m/JAM3m(+) reduced the 
number of significant referrals to colposcopy without compromising diagnostic 
sensitivity.

BACKGROUND: With the popularization of computed tomography, more and more 
pulmonary nodules (PNs) are being detected. Risk stratification of PNs is 
essential for detecting early-stage lung cancer while minimizing the 
overdiagnosis of benign nodules. This study aimed to develop a circulating tumor 
DNA (ctDNA) methylation-based, non-invasive model for the risk stratification of 
PNs.
METHODS: A blood-based assay (""LUNG-TRAC"") was designed to include novel lung 
cancer ctDNA methylation markers identified from in-house reduced representative 
bisulfite sequencing data and known markers from the literature. A 
stratification model was trained based on 183 ctDNA samples derived from 
patients with benign or malignant PNs and validated in 62 patients. LUNG-TRAC 
was further single-blindly tested in a single- and multi-center cohort.
RESULTS: The LUNG-TRAC model achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.810 
(sensitivity = 74.4 % and specificity = 73.7 %) in the validation set. Two test 
sets were used to evaluate the performance of LUNG-TRAC, with an AUC of 0.815 in 
the single-center test (N = 61; sensitivity = 67.5 % and specificity = 76.2 %) 
and 0.761 in the multi-center test (N = 95; sensitivity = 50.7 % and 
specificity = 80.8 %). The clinical utility of LUNG-TRAC was further assessed by 
comparing it to two established risk stratification models: the Mayo Clinic and 
Veteran Administration models. It outperformed both in the validation and the 
single-center test sets.
CONCLUSION: The LUNG-TRAC model demonstrated accuracy and consistency in 
stratifying PNs for the risk of malignancy, suggesting its utility as a 
non-invasive diagnostic aid for early-stage peripheral lung cancer.

N-Methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) and Helicobacter pylori might 
synergistically promote the malignant transformation of human esophageal 
epithelial cells (HEECs) through inducing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and 
inhibition of PAXX protein expression. The long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) TUG1 is 
associated with multiple cancers, and its overexpression can promote cancer by 
interfering with the functions of oncogenes. LncRNA TUG1 is also associated with 
DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and the epithelial signaling pathway of H. 
pylori infection. To explore the role of LncRNA TUG1 in the malignant 
transformation of HEECs induced by H.pylori + MNNG, a stable strain of HEECs 
with LncRNA TUG1 knockdown (LncRNA TUG1-KD) was constructed using RNA 
interference technology with lentivirus as a vector. Set up negative controls 
LncRNA TUG1-NC (null carrier lentivirus was selected to transfect HEECs) and 
block controls (normal HEECs without exposure). H. pylori + MNNG were added to 
the LncRNA TUG1-KD and LncRNA TUG1-NC groups for 6 h and then passaged until 
their malignant transformation. From each group, cells in the early, 
intermediate, and late stages of malignant transformation were used for the 
alkaline comet assay and determination of protein expression, including γ-H2AX 
and PAXX, by western blotting assay to assess DNA damage and repair processes. 
Clone formation assay in soft agar and nude mouse xenograft model was used to 
assess malignancy. This study suggests that H. pylori + MNNG promotes the 
malignant transformation of HEECs by inducing DNA DSBs and inhibiting PAXX 
expression, and this effect may be alleviated by LncRNA TUG1 knockdown. It 
elucidates the pathogenesis of EC from the perspective of the combined effect of 
epigenetic and environmental carcinogens, offering new insights for the 
comprehensive prevention and treatment of EC.

INTRODUCTION: Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is the second-most lethal cancer 
in the United States, with Barrett esophagus (BE) being the strongest risk 
factor. Assessing the future risk of neoplastic progression in patients with BE 
is difficult; however, high-grade dysplasia (HGD) and early EAC are treatable by 
endoscopic eradication therapy (EET), with survival rates of 90%. Thus, it would 
be beneficial to develop a molecular assay to identify high-risk patients, who 
merit more frequent endoscopic surveillance or EET, as well as low-risk 
patients, who can avoid EET and undergo less frequent surveillance.
METHODS: Deidentified endoscopic biopsies were acquired from 240 patients with 
BE at 6 centers and confirmed as future progressors or nonprogressors. Tissues 
were analyzed by a set of methylation-specific biomarker assays. Test 
performance was assessed in an independent validation set using 4 stratification 
levels: low risks, low-moderate risks, high-moderate risks, and high risks.
RESULTS: Relative to patients in the low-risk group, high-risk patients were 
15.2 times more likely to progress within 5 years to HGD or EAC. For patients in 
the high-risk category, the average risk of progressing to HGD or EAC within 5 
years was 21.5%, 4-fold the BE population prevalence within 5 years, whereas 
low-risk patients had a progression risk of only 1.85%.
DISCUSSION: This clinical assay, Esopredict, stratifies future neoplastic 
progression risk to identify higher-risk patients with BE who can benefit from 
EET or more frequent surveillance and lower-risk patients who can benefit from 
reduced surveillance.

The development of targeted therapies offers new hope for patients affected by 
incurable cancer. However, multiple challenges persist, notably in controlling 
tumor cell plasticity in patients with refractory and metastatic illness. 
Neuroblastoma (NB) is an aggressive pediatric malignancy originating from 
defective differentiation of neural crest-derived progenitors with oncogenic 
activity due to genetic and epigenetic alterations and remains a clinical 
challenge for high-risk patients. To identify critical genes driving NB 
aggressiveness, we performed combined chromatin and transcriptome analyses on 
matched patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), spheroids, and differentiated 
adherent cultures derived from metastatic MYCN nonamplified tumors. Bone marrow 
kinase on chromosome X (BMX) was identified among the most differentially 
regulated genes in PDXs and spheroids versus adherent models. BMX expression 
correlated with high tumor stage and poor patient survival and was crucial to 
the maintenance of the self-renewal and tumorigenic potential of NB spheroids. 
Moreover, BMX expression positively correlated with the mesenchymal NB cell 
phenotype, previously associated with increased chemoresistance. Finally, BMX 
inhibitors readily reversed this cellular state, increased the sensitivity of NB 
spheroids toward chemotherapy, and partially reduced tumor growth in a 
preclinical NB model. Altogether, our study identifies BMX as a promising 
innovative therapeutic target for patients with high-risk MYCN nonamplified NB.

Despite the ongoing epidemic of youth vaping, the long-term health consequences 
of electronic cigarette use are largely unknown. We report the effects of vaping 
versus smoking on the oral cell methylome of healthy young vapers and smokers 
relative to nonusers. Whereas vapers and smokers differ in the number of 
differentially methylated regions (DMRs) (831 vs. 2,863), they share striking 
similarities in the distribution and patterns of DNA methylation, chromatin 
states, transcription factor binding motifs, and pathways. There is substantial 
overlap in DMR-associated genes between vapers and smokers, with the shared 
subset of genes enriched for transcriptional regulation, signaling, tobacco use 
disorders, and cancer-related pathways. Of significance is the identification of 
a common hypermethylated DMR at the promoter of HIC1 (hypermethylated in cancer 
1), a tumor suppressor gene frequently silenced in smoking-related cancers. Our 
data support a potential link between epigenomic dysregulation in youth vapers 
and disease risk. These novel findings have significant implications for public 
health and tobacco product regulation.

N6-methyladenosine (m6A) alteration is an epigenetic regulator widely involved 
in the tumorigenicity of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The role of YTH 
N6-methyladenosine RNA binding protein F3 (YTHDF3), an m6A reader in HCC, 
requires further investigation. Here, we aim to explore the biological 
properties of YTHDF3 in HCC and its potential mechanisms. The predictive risk 
model for HCC was developed by analyzing the expression of genes associated with 
m6A in HCC using online datasets. WB and qPCR were employed to assess YTHDF3 
expression in HCC and its correlation with the disease's clinicopathological 
characteristics. Both in vitro and in vivo methods were utilized to evaluate the 
biological effects of YTHDF3 in HCC. The potential targets of YTHDF3 were 
identified and confirmed using RNA-seq, meRIP-seq, and linear amplification and 
sequencing of cDNA ends (Lace-seq). We confirmed that YTHDF3 is overexpressed in 
HCC. Patients with higher YTHDF3 expression had a greater risk of cancer 
recurrence. In both in vitro and in vivo settings, YTHDF3 boosts the migration 
and invasion capabilities of HCC cells. Through multi-omics research, we 
identified YTHDF3's downstream target genes as NKD inhibitors of the WNT 
signaling pathway 1 (NKD1) and the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway. With m6A 
modification, YTHDF3 suppresses the transcription and translation of NKD1. 
Additionally, NKD1 inhibited tumor growth by blocking the WNT/β-catenin 
signaling pathway. The investigation found that the oncogene YTHDF3 stimulates 
the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway by m6A-dependently suppressing NKD1 
expression in HCC cells. Our findings suggest that YTHDF3 regulates 
hepatocarcinogenesis, providing fresh perspectives on potential biomarkers and 
therapeutic targets for HCC.

Exposure to ionizing radiation can result in the development of a number of 
diseases, including cancer, cataracts and neurodegenerative pathologies. Certain 
occupational groups are exposed to both natural and artificial sources of 
radiation as a consequence of their professional activities. The development of 
non-invasive biomarkers to assess the risk of exposure to ionizing radiation for 
these groups is of great importance. In this context, our objective was to 
identify epigenetic and molecular biomarkers that could be used to monitor 
exposure to ionizing radiation. The impact of X-ray exposure on the miRNAs 
profile and the level of cf mtDNA were evaluated using the RT-PCR method. The 
levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in their blood were quantified using the 
ELISA method. A significant decrease in miR-19a-3p, miR-125b-5p and significant 
increase in miR-29a-3p was observed in the blood plasma of individuals exposed 
to X-ray. High levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and cf mtDNA were also 
detected. In silico identification of potential targets of these miRNAs was 
conducted using MIENTURNET. VDAC1 and ALOX5 were identified as possible targets. 
Our study identified promising biomarkers such as miRNAs and cf mtDNA that 
showed a dose-dependent effect of X-ray exposure.

Histones methyltransferase NSD3 targeting H3K36 is frequently disordered and 
mutant in various cancers, while the function of NSD3 during cancer initiation 
and progression remains unclear. In this study, it is proved that downregulated 
level of NSD3 is linked to clinical features and poor survival in lung 
adenocarcinoma. In vivo, NSD3 inhibited the proliferation, immigration, and 
invasion ability of lung adenocarcinoma. Meanwhile, NSD3 suppressed glycolysis 
by inhibiting HK2 translation, transcription, glucose uptake, and lactate 
production in lung adenocarcinoma. Mechanistically, as an intermediary, NSD3 
binds to PPP1CB and p-STAT3 in protein levels, thus forming a trimer to 
dephosphorylate the level of p-STAT3 by PPP1CB, leading to the suppression of 
HK2 transcription. Interestingly, the phosphorylation function of PPP1CB is 
related to the concentration of carbon dioxide and pH value in the culture 
environment. Together, this study revealed the critical non-epigenetic role of 
NSD3 in the regulation of STAT3-dependent glycolysis, providing a piece of 
compelling evidence for targeting the NSD3/PPP1CB/p-STAT3 in lung 
adenocarcinoma.

Although cancer is an age-related disease, how the processes of aging contribute 
to cancer progression is not well understood. In this study, we uncovered how 
mouse B cell lymphoma develops as a consequence of a naturally aged system. We 
show here that this malignancy is associated with an age-associated clonal B 
cell (ACBC) population that likely originates from age-associated B cells. 
Driven by c-Myc activation, promoter hypermethylation and somatic mutations, 
IgM+ ACBCs clonally expand independently of germinal centers and show increased 
biological age. ACBCs become self-sufficient and support malignancy when 
transferred into young recipients. Inhibition of mTOR or c-Myc in old mice 
attenuates pre-malignant changes in B cells during aging. Although the etiology 
of mouse and human B cell lymphomas is considered distinct, epigenetic changes 
in transformed mouse B cells are enriched for changes observed in human B cell 
lymphomas. Together, our findings characterize the spontaneous progression of 
cancer during aging through both cell-intrinsic and microenvironmental changes 
and suggest interventions for its prevention.

cancer risk, but the underlying mechanisms of crucial POPs exposure remain 
unclear. Hence, we systematically investigated the associations among POPs 
exposure, genetics and epigenetics and their effects on colorectal cancer. A 
case-control study was conducted in the Chinese population for detecting POPs 
levels. We measured the concentrations of 24 POPs in the plasma using gas 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) and evaluated the clinical 
significance of POPs by calculating the area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve (AUC). To assess the associations between candidate genetic 
variants and colorectal cancer risk, unconditional logistic regression was used. 
Compared with healthy control individuals, individuals with colorectal cancer 
exhibited higher concentrations of the majority of POPs. Exposure to PCB153 was 
positively associated with colorectal cancer risk, and PCB153 demonstrated 
superior accuracy (AUC=0.72) for predicting colorectal cancer compared to other 
analytes. On PCB153-related genes, the rs67734009 C allele was significantly 
associated with reduced colorectal cancer risk and lower plasma levels of 
PCB153. Moreover, rs67734009 exhibited an expression quantitative trait locus 
(eQTL) effect on ESR1, of which the expression level was negatively related to 
PCB153 concentration. Mechanistically, the risk allele of rs67734009 increased 
ESR1 expression via miR-3492 binding and m6A modification. Collectively, this 
study sheds light on potential genetic and epigenetic mechanisms linking PCB153 
exposure and colorectal cancer risk, thereby providing insight into the accurate 
protection against POPs exposure.

One of the main causes of cancer-related mortality for women worldwide is breast 
cancer (BC). The XRCC2 gene, essential for DNA repair, has been implicated in 
cancer susceptibility. This study aims to evaluate the association between XRCC2 
and BC risk. The study was conducted at Zheen International Hospital in Erbil, 
Iraq, between 2021 and 2024 with a total of 88 samples, including 44 paired 
normal and cancer tissue samples. Mutation analysis was performed using 
Next-Generation Sequencing, coupled with in silico tools for variant impact 
prediction. Expression levels were assessed through RT-PCR, and methylation 
status was determined using methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme digestion 
PCR. The study identified seven inherited germline variants in the XRCC2 gene, 
with five of these mutations being Uncertain Significance, one being Likely 
Pathogenic, and one being Likely benign. RNA purity was found high with mean 
A260/280 ratios of 1.986 ± 0.097 in normal (N) and 1.963 ± 0.092 in tumor (T) 
samples. Tumor samples exhibited a higher RNA concentration (78.56 ± 40.87 
ng/µL) than normal samples (71.44 ± 40.79 ng/µL). XRCC2 gene expression was 
significantly upregulated in tumor tissue, with marked increases in patients 
aged 40-55 and >56 years and in higher cancer grades (II and III) and invasive 
ductal carcinoma (p-values ranging from <0.0001 to 0.0392). DNA methylation 
rates in tumor tissues were low (7%), suggesting limited regulation by 
methylation. The study suggests that XRCC2 can be classified as an oncogene and 
that its structural investigation by targeted NGS and expression evaluation can 
be used as a potential biomarker in BC.

BACKGROUND: Periodontal disease and DNA methylation markers have separately been 
associated with lung cancer risk. Examining methylation levels at genomic 
regions previously linked to periodontal disease may provide insights on the 
link between periodontal disease and lung cancer.
METHODS: In a nested case-control study drawn from the CLUE II cohort, we 
measured DNA methylation levels in 208 lung cancer cases and 208 controls. We 
examined the association between 37 DNA-methylated 5'-C-phosphate-G-3' (CpG) 
sites at three genomic regions, homeobox 4 (HOXA4), zinc finger protein (ZFP57), 
and a long noncoding RNA gene located in Chr10 (ENSG00000231601), and lung 
cancer risk.
RESULTS: Statistically significant associations with lung cancer risk were 
observed for all 14 CpG sites from HOXA4 (OR ranging 1.41-1.62 for 1 SD increase 
in the DNA methylation level, especially within 15 years) and 1 CpG site on gene 
ENSG00000231601 (OR = 1.34 for 1 SD increase in the DNA methylation level). 
Although CpG sites on gene ZFP57 were not associated with lung cancer risk 
overall, statistically significant inverse associations were noted for six CpG 
sites when restricting follow-up to 15 years (OR = 0.73-0.77 for 1 SD increase 
in the DNA methylation level).
CONCLUSIONS: Key methylation levels associated with periodontal disease are also 
associated with lung cancer risk. For both HOXA4 and ZFP57, the associations 
were stronger within 15 years of follow-up, which suggest that, if causal, the 
impact of methylation is acting late in the natural history of lung cancer.
IMPACT: Identifying biological pathways that link periodontal disease and lung 
cancer could provide new opportunities for lung cancer detection and prevention.

Recent advances in molecular analyses of ovarian cancer have revealed a wealth 
of promising tumour-specific biomarkers, including protein, DNA mutations and 
methylation; however, reliably detecting such alterations at satisfactorily high 
sensitivity and specificity through low-cost methods remains challenging, 
especially in early-stage diseases. Here we present PapDREAM, a new approach 
that enables detection of rare, ovarian-cancer-specific aberrations of DNA 
methylation from routinely-collected cervical Pap specimens. The PapDREAM 
approach employs a microfluidic platform that performs highly parallelized 
digital high-resolution melt to analyze locus-specific DNA methylation patterns 
on a molecule-by-molecule basis at or near single CpG-site resolution at a 
fraction (< 1/10th) of the cost of next-generation sequencing techniques. We 
demonstrate the feasibility of the platform by assessing intermolecular 
heterogeneity of DNA methylation in a panel of methylation biomarker loci using 
DNA derived from Pap specimens obtained from a cohort of 43 women, including 18 
cases with ovarian cancer and 25 cancer-free controls. PapDREAM leverages 
systematic multidimensional bioinformatic analyses of locus-specific methylation 
heterogeneity to improve upon Pap-specimen-based detection of ovarian cancer, 
demonstrating a clinical sensitivity of 50% at 99% specificity in detecting 
ovarian cancer cases with an area under the receiver operator curve of 0.90. We 
then establish a logistic regression model that could be used to identify 
high-risk patients for subsequent clinical follow-up and monitoring. The results 
of this study support the utility of PapDREAM as a simple, low-cost screening 
method with the potential to integrate with existing clinical workflows for 
early detection of ovarian cancer. KEY POINTS: We present a microfluidic 
platform for detection and analysis of rare, heterogeneously methylated DNA 
within Pap specimens towards detection of ovarian cancer. The platform achieves 
high sensitivity (fractions <0.00005%) at a suitably low cost (∼$25) for routine 
screening applications. Furthermore, it provides molecule-by-molecule 
quantitative analysis to facilitate further study on the effect of heterogeneous 
methylation on cancer development.

Aim: This study investigates the altered expression and CpG methylation patterns 
of histone demethylase KDM8 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), aiming to uncover 
insights and promising diagnostics biomarkers.Materials & methods: Leveraging 
TCGA-LIHC multi-omics data, we employed R/Bioconductor libraries and Cytoscape 
to analyze and construct a gene correlation network, and LASSO regression to 
develop an HCC-predictive model.Results: In HCC, KDM8 downregulation is 
correlated with CpGs hypermethylation. Differential gene correlation analysis 
unveiled a liver carcinoma-associated network marked by increased cell division 
and compromised liver-specific functions. The LASSO regression identified a 
highly accurate HCC prediction signature, prominently featuring CpG methylation 
at cg02871891.Conclusion: Our study uncovers CpG hypermethylation at cg02871891, 
possibly influencing KDM8 downregulation in HCC, suggesting these as promising 
biomarkers and targets.

Plain Language Summary: Changes in gene function can play a role in causing 
cancer. In this study, we looked at how a specific gene called KDM8 behaves in 
liver cancer. By analyzing a large set of liver cancer samples, we investigated 
how gene interactions are different in this disease and if they can help predict 
liver cancer risk. Our results show that the KDM8 gene is less active, and its 
DNA gets chemically modified more often in liver cancer. We also found a group 
of genes and DNA changes, which are linked to the disease. Using this 
information, we identified 16 important markers and built a computer model that 
can accurately predict liver cancer. We found that DNA methylation at a specific 
spot called cg02871891 is especially important for predicting liver cancer. 
Overall, our study suggests that high levels of DNA methylation may lead to 
reduced KDM8 activity in liver cancer, which could be important for future 
research and better diagnostic tools.

DNA methylation and gene expression are two critical aspects of the epigenetic 
landscape that contribute significantly to cancer pathogenesis. Analysis of 
aberrant genome-wide methylation patterns can provide insights into how these 
affect the cancer transcriptome and possible clinical implications for cancer 
diagnosis and treatment. The role of tumor suppressors and oncogenes is well 
known in tumorigenesis. Epigenetic alterations can significantly impact the 
expression and function of these critical genes, contributing to the initiation 
and progression of cancer. This protocol chapter presents a unified workflow to 
explore the role of DNA methylation in gene expression regulation in breast 
cancer by identifying differentially expressed genes whose promoter or gene body 
regions are differentially methylated using various Bioconductor packages in R 
environment. Functional enrichment analysis of these genes can help in 
understanding the mechanisms leading to tumorigenesis due to epigenetic 
alterations.

CRNDE is an oncogene expressed as a long non-coding RNA. However, our team 
previously reported that the CRNDE gene also encodes a micropeptide, CRNDEP. The 
amino acid sequence of CRNDEP has recently been revealed by other researchers, 
too. This study aimed to investigate genetic alterations within the 
CRNDEP-coding region of the CRNDE gene, methylation profiling of this gene, and 
CRNDEP expression analysis. All investigations were performed on clinical 
material from patients with ovarian tumors of diverse aggressiveness. We found 
that CRNDEP levels were significantly elevated in highly aggressive tumors 
compared to benign neoplasms. Consistently, a high level of this micropeptide 
was a negative, independent, prognostic, and predictive factor in high-grade 
ovarian cancer (hgOvCa) patients. The cancer-promoting role of CRNDE(P), shown 
in our recent study, was also supported by genetic and epigenetic results 
obtained herein, revealing no CRNDEP-disrupting mutations in any clinical 
sample. Moreover, in borderline ovarian tumors (BOTS), but not in ovarian 
cancers, the presence of a single nucleotide polymorphism in CRNDE, rs115515594, 
significantly increased the risk of recurrence. Consistently, in BOTS only, the 
same genetic variant was highly overrepresented compared to healthy individuals. 
We also discovered that hypomethylation of CRNDE is associated with increased 
aggressiveness of ovarian tumors. Accordingly, hypomethylation of this gene's 
promoter/first exon correlated with hgOvCa resistance to chemotherapy, but only 
in specimens with accumulation of the TP53 tumor suppressor protein. Taken 
together, these results contribute to a better understanding of the role of 
CRNDE(P) in tumorigenesis and potentially may lead to improvements in screening, 
diagnosis, and treatment of ovarian neoplasms.

The incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) is closely linked to metabolic 
diseases. Accumulating evidence suggests the regulatory role of AMP-activated 
protein kinase (AMPK) in cancer metabolic reprogramming. In this study, 
wild-type and AMPK knockout mice were subjected to azoxymethane-induced and 
dextran sulfate sodium (AOM/DSS)-promoted colitis-associated CRC induction. A 
stable AMPK-deficient Caco-2 cell line was also established for the mechanistic 
studies. The data showed that AMPK deficiency accelerated CRC development, 
characterized by increased tumor number, tumor size, and hyperplasia in 
AOM/DSS-treated mice. The aggravated colorectal tumorigenesis resulting from 
AMPK ablation was associated with reduced α-ketoglutarate production and 
ten-eleven translocation hydroxylase 2 (TET2) transcription, correlated with the 
reduced mismatch repair protein mutL homolog 1 (MLH1) protein. Furthermore, in 
AMPK-deficient Caco-2 cells, the mRNA expression of mismatch repair and tumor 
suppressor genes, intracellular α-ketoglutarate, and the protein level of TET2 
were also downregulated. AMPK deficiency also increased hypermethylation in the 
CpG islands of Mlh1 in both colonic tissues and Caco-2 cells. In conclusion, 
AMPK deficiency leads to reduced α-ketoglutarate concentration and elevates the 
suppressive epigenetic modifications of tumor suppressor genes in gut epithelial 
cells, thereby increasing the risk of colorectal tumorigenesis. Given the 
modifiable nature of AMPK activity, it holds promise as a prospective molecular 
target for the prevention and treatment of CRC.

OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to evaluate the performance of a host gene 
methylation marker panel (ASTN1, DLX1, ITGA4, RXFP3, SOX17, and ZNF671) in the 
triage of human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive women, its possible impact in a 
cervical cancer screening program, and the possible influence of the variation 
of the rate of HPV16/18 in its performance.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cohort study in which consecutive women referred for 
colposcopy in an organized cervical cancer screening program had repeated HPV 
testing, colposcopy, and biopsies. The women that remained HPV positive at the 
time of colposcopy were tested with the panel of DNA methylation markers. The 
performance of the test was evaluated and compared to standard practice.
RESULTS: The study test had a sensitivity and specificity for cervical 
intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2+ of 60.8% (49.1-71.6%) and 88.4% (83.2-92.5%), 
respectively. For CIN3+, it was of 78.0% (64.0-88.5%) and 86.0% (80.8-90.2%), 
respectively. The rate and level of methylation positively correlated with the 
severity of disease. The use of methylation reduces the referral for colposcopy 
to 25.5%, while detecting 78.0% of the CIN3+ cases. Referral of all 
HPV16/18-positive cases and triage of the other high-risk HPV-positive cases 
with methylation, detects 90.0% of the cases of CIN3+, while reducing the number 
of referrals to 43.2%. The variation in the rate of HPV16/18 does not relevantly 
affect the performance of the methylation panel.
CONCLUSIONS: The studied methylation panel has a high sensitivity and 
specificity for CIN3+ and reduces the rate of referrals for colposcopy, without 
relevant variation according to the rate of HPV16/18.

INTRODUCTION: Essential thrombocythemia (ET) involves the proliferation of 
megakaryocytes and platelets and is associated with an increased risk of 
thrombosis. We aimed to evaluate thrombotic risks in patients with epigenetic 
regulator mutations and generate a model to predict thrombosis in ET.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cohort study enrolled patients aged > 15 years 
diagnosed with ET at the Songklanakarind Hospital between January 2002 and 
December 2019. Twenty-five targeted gene mutations, including somatic driver 
mutations (JAK2, CALR, MPL), epigenetic regulator mutations (TET2, DNMT3A, IDH1, 
IDH2, TET2, ASXL1, EZH2, SF3B1, SRSF2) and other genes relevant to myeloid 
neoplasms, were identified using next-generation sequencing. Thrombotic events 
were confirmed based on clinical condition and imaging findings, and thrombotic 
risks were analyzed using five survival models with the recurrent event method.
RESULTS: Ninety-six patients were enrolled with a median follow-up of 6.91 
years. Of these, 15 patients experienced 17 arterial thrombotic events in total. 
Patients with JAK2 mutation and IDH1 mutation had the highest frequency of 
thrombotic events with somatic driver mutations (17.3%) and epigenetic regulator 
mutations (100%). The 10-year thrombosis-free survival rate was 81.3% (95% 
confidence interval: 72.0-91.8%). IDH1 mutation was a significant factor for 
thrombotic risk in the multivariate analysis for all models. The Prentice, 
William, and Peterson (PWP) gap-time model was the most appropriate prediction 
model.
CONCLUSIONS: The PWP gap-time model was a good predictive model for thrombotic 
risk in patients with ET. IDH1 mutation was significant risk factors for 
thrombosis; however, further studies with a larger sample size should confirm 
this and provide more insight.

PURPOSE: AML is a hematologic cancer that is clinically heterogeneous, with a 
wide range of clinical outcomes. DNA methylation changes are a hallmark of AML 
but are not routinely used as a criterion for risk stratification. The aim of 
this study was to explore DNA methylation markers that could risk stratify 
patients with cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML), currently classified as 
intermediate-risk.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: DNA methylation profiles in whole blood samples from 77 
patients with CN-AML in The Cancer Genome Atlas (LAML cohort) were analyzed. 
Individual 5'-cytosine-phosphate-guanine-3' (CpG) sites were assessed for their 
ability to predict overall survival. The output was validated using DNA 
methylation profiles from bone marrow samples of 79 patients with CN-AML in a 
separate data set from the Gene Expression Omnibus.
RESULTS: In the training set, using DNA methylation data derived from the 450K 
array, we identified 2,549 CpG sites that could potentially distinguish patients 
with CN-AML with an adverse prognosis (intermediate-poor) from those with a more 
favorable prognosis (intermediate-favorable) independent of age. Of these, 25 
CpGs showed consistent prognostic potential across both the 450K and 27K array 
platforms. In a separate validation data set, nine of these 25 CpGs exhibited 
statistically significant differences in 2-year survival. These nine validated 
CpGs formed the basis for a combined prognostic biomarker panel, which includes 
an 8-CpG Somatic Panel and the methylation status of cg23947872. This panel 
displayed strong predictive ability for 2-year survival, 2-year progression-free 
survival, and complete remission in the validation cohort.
CONCLUSION: This study highlights DNA methylation profiling as a promising 
approach to enhance risk stratification in patients with CN-AML, potentially 
offering a pathway to more personalized treatment strategies.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is known to develop due to the accumulation of both 
genetic and epigenetic alterations, resulting in the conversion of intestinal 
epithelial cells to malignant adenocarcinoma cells. Caudal type homeobox 1 
(CDX1) gene is a homeobox transcription factor and a selective tumour suppressor 
gene that is an important factor for the development of intestinal cells. This 
gene plays a role in the differentiation of intestinal epithelial cells, and its 
expression decreases in a number of cell lines derived from CRC, which suggests 
that a lack of CDX1 expression is a risk factor for the development of 
colorectal carcinoma. Therefore, the methylated DNA amounts of CDX1 gene in 
stool samples were investigated as a noninvasive method for the detection of 
CRC. In the present study, the methylation of CDX1 gene promoter region was 
assessed in stool samples of 50 CRC patients and 50 healthy individuals by 
MethyLight PCR using two primers and a Taq Man probe, which was completely 
specifically designed for fully methylated DNA of the gene promoter region. The 
percentage of methylated reference (PMR) of the studied gene in all samples was 
calculated similarly to previous studies. Statistical analysis was performed 
using SPSS 16. The PMR medians were 3.25 (95% CI: 0.1-100) and 0.1 (95% CI: 
0.07-1) in the stool samples of CRC patients and healthy individuals, 
respectively. The results showed a significant difference in CDX1 gene PMR 
between stool samples of CRC patients and controls (P-value\0.001). According to 
the results of this study, it can be argued that measurement of CDX1 gene DNA in 
stool samples using the MethyLight PCR has acceptable sensitivity and 
specificity, and is adequately potential to be used as a noninvasive 
complementary method for the diagnosis of CRC, along with colonoscopy as the 
gold standard to this end. This study is the first report on CDX1 methylation in 
stool samples of CRC patients. Therefore, further research should be carried out 
with a larger sample size to evaluate its efficacy as a diagnostic biomarker in 
clinical laboratories.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to explore the value of DNA (CDO1m/CELF4m) 
methylation detection in exfoliated cervical cells collected for screening 
endometrial cancer in premenopausal women with abnormal uterine bleeding.
METHODS: A total of 296 premenopausal women with abnormal uterine bleeding 
admitted to the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Third Xiangya 
Hospital of Central South University from November 2021 to October 2022 were 
selected. Clinical characteristics, endometrial thickness measured by 
transvaginal ultrasound and serum CA125 were collected. Exfoliated cervical 
cells from the thinPrep cytogic test were collected for DNA (CDO1m/CELF4m) 
methylation testing. Endometrial tissue was collected under hysteroscopy for 
pathological diagnosis as the gold standard. A univariate logistic regression 
model was used to analyze risk factors for endometrial cancer. The receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) curve and area under the curve (AUC) were used to 
measure the diagnostic efficacy of DNA methylation detection in endometrial 
cancer screening of women with abnormal uterine bleeding.
RESULTS: Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that age, body mass 
index (BMI) ≥25 kg/m2, endometrial thickness ≥11 mm, CDO1 methylation 
(CDO1mΔCt≤8.4), CELF4 methylation (CELF4mΔCt≤8.8), and dual gene methylation 
(CDO1mΔCt≤8.4 or CELF4mΔCt≤8.8) were independent risk factors for endometrial 
cancer in women with abnormal uterine bleeding. The odds ratio (OR) values 
(95% confidence interval (CI) were 0.87 (0.80-0.95), 4.76 (1.89-11.96), 8.41 
(3.13-22.59), 64.49 (20.46-203.33), 12.79 (4.91-33.30), and 42.53 
(11.90-152.04), respectively. Among these indicators, dual gene methylation had 
the higher sensitivity and specificity for endometrial cancer screening (85.7% 
and 87.6%). Moreover, dual gene methylation combined with BMI or endometrial 
thickness could further improve the screening efficiency of endometrial cancer 
in women with abnormal uterine bleeding.
CONCLUSIONS: In premenopausal women with abnormal uterine bleeding, the clinical 
efficacy of DNA (CDO1m/CELF4m) methylation detection in exfoliated cervical 
cells for endometrial cancer screening was better than that of other noninvasive 
clinical indicators. In addition, dual gene methylation combined with BMI or 
endometrial thickness was a good predictor of endometrial cancer screening.

Mixed invasive ductal and lobular carcinoma (MDLC) is a rare histologic subtype 
of breast cancer displaying both E-cadherin positive ductal and E-cadherin 
negative lobular morphologies within the same tumor, posing challenges with 
regard to anticipated clinical management. It remains unclear whether these 
distinct morphologies also have distinct biology and risk of recurrence. Our 
spatially resolved transcriptomic, genomic, and single-cell profiling revealed 
clinically significant differences between ductal and lobular tumor regions 
including distinct intrinsic subtype heterogeneity - e.g., MDLC with 
triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) or basal ductal and estrogen receptor 
positive (ER+) luminal lobular regions, distinct enrichment of cell cycle 
arrest/senescence and oncogenic (ER and MYC) signatures, genetic and epigenetic 
CDH1 inactivation in lobular but not ductal regions, and single-cell ductal and 
lobular subpopulations with unique oncogenic signatures further highlighting 
intraregional heterogeneity. Altogether, we demonstrated that the intratumoral 
morphological/histological heterogeneity within MDLC is underpinned by intrinsic 
subtype and oncogenic heterogeneity which may result in prognostic uncertainty 
and therapeutic dilemma.

Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling is vitally important in 
tumour development and progression. This study is the first to comprehensively 
analyse the role of MAPK-family genes in the progression, prognosis, immune-cell 
infiltration, methylation, and potential therapeutic value drug candidates in 
ccRCC. We identified a novel prognostic panel of six MAPK-signature genes 
(MAP3K12, MAP3K1, MAP3K5, MAPK1, MAPK8, MAPK9), and introduced a robust 
MAPK-signature risk model for predicting ccRCC prognosis. Model construction, 
evaluation, and external validation using datasets from the Cancer Genome Atlas 
(TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database demonstrated its stability, as 
well as high sensitivity and specificity. Enrichment analysis suggested the 
participation of immune-mediated mechanism in MAPK dysregulation in ccRCC. 
Immune-infiltration analysis confirmed the relationship and revealed that the 
MAPK-signature risk model might stratify immunotherapy response in ccRCC, which 
was verified in drug sensitivity analysis and validated in external ccRCC 
immunotherapy dataset (GSE67501). Potential therapeutic drug predictions for key 
MAPKs using DSigDB, Network Analyst, CTD, and DGIdb were subsequently verified 
by molecular docking with AutoDock Vina and PyMol. Mendelian randomization 
further demonstrated the possibilities of the MAPK-signature genes as targets 
for therapeutic drugs in ccRCC. Methylation analysis using UALCAN and MethSurv 
revealed the participation of epigenetic modifications in dysregulation and 
survival difference of MAPK pathway in ccRCC. Among the key MAPKs, MAP3K12 
exhibited the highest significance, indicating its independent prognostic value 
as single gene in ccRCC. Knockout and overexpression validation experiments in 
vitro and in vivo found that MAP3K12 acted as a promoter of tumour progression 
in RCC, suggesting a pivotal role for MAP3K12 in the proliferation, migration, 
and invasion of RCC cells. Our findings proposed the potential of MAPK-signature 
genes as biomarkers for prognosis and therapy response, as well as targets for 
therapeutic drugs in ccRCC.

BACKGROUND: Growing evidence suggests that liver disease originates in early 
life. Antihistamines cross the placenta and are frequently prescribed to 
pregnant women to treat nausea and vomiting, as well as allergy and asthma 
symptoms. Exposure to antihistamines in utero may impact the developing liver by 
reprogramming or inducing epigenetic changes in fetal hepatocytes.
METHODS: We examined in utero exposure to antihistamines and the risk of HCC in 
the Child Health and Development Studies, a multigenerational cohort that 
enrolled pregnant women in the East Bay, CA, between 1959 and 1966 (n=14,507 
mothers and 18,751 liveborn offspring). We reviewed mothers' medical records to 
identify those prescribed antihistamines during pregnancy, and diagnoses of HCC 
in adult (age ≥18 y) offspring were identified by linkage with a 
population-based cancer registry. Cox proportional hazard models were used to 
estimate adjusted hazard ratios, with follow-up accrued from birth through 
cancer diagnosis, death, or last contact.
RESULTS: About 15% of offspring (n=2759 of 18,751) were exposed in utero to 
antihistamines. Chlorpheniramine (51.8%) and diphenhydramine (15.4%) were the 2 
most commonly prescribed antihistamines. Any in utero exposure was not 
associated with HCC (adjusted hazard ratio: 2.76, 95% CI: 0.70, 10.89), but the 
association differed by timing of exposure. Offspring exposed to antihistamines 
in the first or second trimester had a higher risk of HCC compared to offspring 
not exposed (adjusted hazard ratio: 4.64, 95% CI: 1.21, 17.78). Similarly, 
incidence rates were 4.3 per 100,000 (95% CI: 0.9, 12.6) for offspring exposed 
in the first or second trimester compared to 1.0 per 100,000 (95% CI: 0.3, 2.1) 
for offspring not exposed.
CONCLUSIONS: In utero exposure to antihistamines in early pregnancy may increase 
the risk of HCC in adulthood.

perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) has been epidemiologically associated with 
breast cancer, and can induce proliferation and malignant transformation of 
normal human breast epithelial cells (MCF-10A), but the information about its 
effect on DNA methylation is sparse. The aim of this study was to characterize 
the whole-genome methylome effects of PFOS in our breast cell model and compare 
the findings with previously demonstrated DNA methylation alterations in breast 
tumor tissues. The DNA methylation profile was assessed at single CpG resolution 
in MCF-10A cells treated with 1 μM PFOS for 72 h by using Enzymatic Methyl 
sequencing (EM-seq). We found 12,591 differentially methylated CpG-sites and 
13,360 differentially methylated 100 bp tiles in the PFOS exposed breast cells. 
These differentially methylated regions (DMRs) overlapped with 2406 genes of 
which 494 were long non-coding RNA and 1841 protein coding genes. We identified 
339 affected genes that have been shown to display altered DNA methylation in 
breast cancer tissue and several other genes related to cancer development. This 
includes hypermethylation of GACAT3, DELEC1, CASC2, LCIIAR, MUC16, SYNE1 and 
hypomethylation of TTN and KMT2C. DMRs were also found in estrogen receptor 
genes (ESR1, ESR2, ESRRG, ESRRB, GREB1) and estrogen responsive genes (GPER1, 
EEIG1, RERG). The gene ontology analysis revealed pathways related to cancer 
phenotypes such as cell adhesion and growth. These findings improve the 
understanding of PFOS's potential role in breast cancer and illustrate the value 
of whole-genome methylome analysis in uncovering mechanisms of chemical effects, 
identifying biomarker candidates, and strengthening epidemiological 
associations, potentially impacting risk assessment.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Disruption of the epigenome is a hallmark of human disease, 
including liver cirrhosis and HCC. While genetic heterogeneity is an established 
effector of pathologic phenotypes, epigenetic heterogeneity is less well 
understood. Environmental exposures alter the liver-specific DNA methylation 
landscape and influence the onset of liver cancer. Given that currently 
available treatments are unable to target frequently mutated genes in HCC, there 
is an unmet need for novel therapeutics to prevent or reverse liver damage 
leading to hepatic tumorigenesis, which the epigenome may provide.
APPROACH AND RESULTS: We performed genome-wide profiling of DNA methylation, 
copy number, and gene expression from multiple liver regions from 31 patients 
with liver disease to examine their crosstalk and define the individual and 
combinatorial contributions of these processes to liver disease progression. We 
identified epigenetic heterogeneity hotspots that are conserved across patients. 
Elevated epigenetic heterogeneity is associated with increased gene expression 
heterogeneity. Cirrhotic regions comprise 2 distinct cohorts-one exclusively 
epigenetic, and the other where epigenetic and copy number variations 
collaborate. Epigenetic heterogeneity hotspots are enriched for genes central to 
liver function (eg, HNF1A ) and known tumor suppressors (eg, RASSF1A ). These 
hotspots encompass genes including ACSL1 , ACSL5 , MAT1A , and ELFN1 , which 
have phenotypic effects in functional screens, supporting their relevance to 
hepatocarcinogenesis. Moreover, epigenetic heterogeneity hotspots are linked to 
clinical measures of outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: Substantial epigenetic heterogeneity arises early in liver disease 
development, targeting key pathways in the progression and initiation of both 
cirrhosis and HCC. Integration of epigenetic and transcriptional heterogeneity 
unveils putative epigenetic regulators of hepatocarcinogenesis.

The relationship between tissue-specific DNA methylation and cancer risk remains 
inadequately elucidated. Leveraging resources from the Genotype-Tissue 
Expression consortium, here we develop genetic models to predict DNA methylation 
at CpG sites across the genome for seven tissues and apply these models to 
genome-wide association study data of corresponding cancers, namely breast, 
colorectal, renal cell, lung, ovarian, prostate, and testicular germ cell 
cancers. At Bonferroni-corrected P < 0.05, we identify 4248 CpGs that are 
significantly associated with cancer risk, of which 95.4% (4052) are specific to 
a particular cancer type. Notably, 92 CpGs within 55 putative novel loci retain 
significant associations with cancer risk after conditioning on proximal signals 
identified by genome-wide association studies. Integrative multi-omics analyses 
reveal 854 CpG-gene-cancer trios, suggesting that DNA methylation at 309 
distinct CpGs might influence cancer risk through regulating the expression of 
205 unique cis-genes. These findings substantially advance our understanding of 
the interplay between genetics, epigenetics, and gene expression in cancer 
etiology.

BACKGROUND: Folate is involved in multiple genetic, epigenetic, and metabolic 
processes, and inadequate folate intake has been associated with an increased 
risk of cancer.
OBJECTIVE: We examined whether folate intake is differentially associated with 
colorectal cancer (CRC) risk according to somatic mutations in genes linked to 
CRC using targeted sequencing.
DESIGN: Participants within 2 large CRC consortia with available information on 
dietary folate, supplemental folic acid, and total folate intake were included. 
Colorectal tumor samples from cases were sequenced for the presence of nonsilent 
mutations in 105 genes and 6 signaling pathways (IGF2/PI3K, MMR, RTK/RAS, TGF-β, 
WNT, and TP53/ATM). Multinomial logistic regression models were analyzed 
comparing mutated/nonmutated CRC cases to controls to compute 
multivariable-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence interval (CI). 
Heterogeneity of associations of mutated compared with nonmutated CRC cases was 
tested in case-only analyses using logistic regression. Analyses were performed 
separately in hypermutated and nonhypermutated tumors, because they exhibit 
different clinical behaviors.
RESULTS: We included 4339 CRC cases (702 hypermutated tumors, 16.2%) and 11,767 
controls. Total folate intake was inversely associated with CRC risk (OR = 0.93; 
95% CI: 0.90, 0.96). Among hypermutated tumors, 12 genes (AXIN2, B2M, BCOR, 
CHD1, DOCK3, FBLN2, MAP3K21, POLD1, RYR1, TET2, UTP20, and ZNF521) showed 
nominal statistical significance (P < 0.05) for heterogeneity by mutation 
status, but none remained significant after multiple testing correction. Among 
these genetic subtypes, the associations between folate variables and CRC were 
mostly inverse or toward the null, except for tumors mutated for DOCK3 
(supplemental folic acid), CHD1 (total folate), and ZNF521 (dietary folate) that 
showed positive associations. We did not observe differential associations in 
analyses among nonhypermutated tumors, or according to the signaling pathways.
CONCLUSIONS: Folate intake was not differentially associated with CRC risk 
according to mutations in the genes explored. The nominally significant 
differential mutation effects observed in a few genes warrants further 
investigation.

Multiplex gene regulation enables the controlled and simultaneous alteration of 
the expression levels of multiple genes and is generally pursued to precisely 
alter complex cellular pathways with a single intervention. Thus far, this has 
been typically exploited in combination with genome editing tools (i.e., 
base-/prime-editing, designer nucleases) to enable simultaneous genetic 
alterations and modulate complex physiologic cellular pathways. In the field of 
cancer immunotherapy, multiplex genome editing has been used to simultaneously 
inactivate three genes (i.e., TRAC, B2M, and PDCD1) and generate universal 
chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells resistant to the inhibitory activity of 
the PD-1 ligand. However, the intrinsic risk of genomic aberrations driven by 
such tools poses concerns because of the generation of multiple single-strand or 
double-strand DNA breaks followed by DNA repair. Modulating gene expression 
without DNA damage using epigenome editing promises a safer and efficient 
approach to alter gene expression. This method enables for simultaneous 
activation and/or repression of target genes, offering superior fine-tuning 
capabilities with reduced off-targeting effects and potential reversibility as 
compared to genome editing. Here we describe a detailed protocol for achieving 
multiplexed and sustainable gene silencing in CAR T cells. In an exemplary 
approach, we use designer epigenome modifiers (DEMs) for the simultaneous 
inactivation of two T cell inhibitory genes, PDCD1 and LAG3 to generate CAR T 
cells with increased resistance to tumor-induced exhaustion.

Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) is associated with the development of lung cancer, but the 
underlying mechanism has not been completely clarified. Here, we used 10 μM BaP 
to induce malignant transformation of human bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells, 
named BEAS-2B-T. Results indicated that BaP (6.25, 12.5 and 25 μM) treatment 
significantly promoted the migration and invasion of BEAS-2B-T cells. Meanwhile, 
BaP exposure inhibited ferroptosis in BEAS-2B-T, ferroptosis-related indexes 
Fe2+, malondialdehyde (MDA), lipid peroxidation (LPO) and reactive oxygen 
species (ROS) decreased significantly. The protein level of ferroptosis-related 
molecule transferrin receptor (TFRC) decreased significantly, while solute 
carrier family 7 membrane 11 (SLC7A11), ferritin heavy chain 1 (FTH1) and 
glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) increased significantly. The intervention of 
ferroptosis dramatically effected the migration and invasion of BEAS-2B-T 
induced by BaP. Furthermore, the expression of YTH N6-methyladenosine RNA 
binding protein 1 (YTHDF1) was markedly increased after BaP exposure. YTHDF1 
knockdown inhibited BEAS-2B-T migration and invasion by promoting ferroptosis. 
In the meantime, the contents of Fe2+, MDA, LPO and ROS increased significantly, 
TFRC was markedly increased, and SLC7A11, FTH1, and GPX4 were markedly 
decreased. Moreover, overexpression of YTHDF1 promoted BEAS-2B-T migration and 
invasion by inhibiting ferroptosis. Importantly, knockdown of YTHDF1 promoted 
ferroptosis and reduced BEAS-2B-T migration and invasion during BaP exposure, 
and overexpression of YTHDF1 increased migration and invasion of BEAS-2B-T by 
inhibiting ferroptosis during BaP exposure. RNA immunoprecipitation assays 
indicated that the binding of YTHDF1 to SLC7A11 and FTH1 markedly increased 
after YTHDF1 overexpression. Therefore, we concluded that BaP promotes the 
malignant progression of BEAS-2B-T cells through YTHDF1 upregulating SLC7A11 and 
FTH1 to inhibit ferroptosis. This study reveals new epigenetic and ferroptosis 
markers for preventing and treating lung cancer induced by environmental 
carcinogens.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most deathly worldwide and 
third most common cancer, CRC is a very heterogeneous disease where tumors can 
form by both environmental and genetic risk factors and includes epigenetic and 
genetic alternations. Inhibitors of DNA binding proteins (ID) are a class of 
helix-loop-helix transcription regulatory factors; these proteins are considered 
a family of four highly preserved transcriptional regulators (ID1-4), shown to 
play significant roles in many processes that are associated with tumor 
development. ID family plays as negatively dominant antagonists of other 
essential HLH proteins, concluding the creation of non-functional heterodimers 
and regulation of the transcription process.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 120 Fresh tissue and blood samples Forty (40) samples of 
fresh tissue and blood were collected from patients diagnosed with CRC, twenty 
(20) samples were collected from a patient diagnosed as healthy. The (qRT-PCR) 
method is a sensitive technique for the quantifying of steady-state mRNA levels 
that used to evaluation the expression levels of ID (1-4) gene.
RESULTS: The findings indicate downregulation in ID1 in tissue with a highly 
significant change between patients and control groups, where upregulation in 
the ID1 gene is shown in blood samples.ID2 gene also demonstrated high 
significant change where show upregulation in tissue and downregulation in blood 
sample. ID3 and ID4 genes show downregulation in tissue and blood samples with a 
significant change in ID3 blood samples between patient and blood groups.
CONCLUSION: Because of the regulation function of the ID family in many 
processes, the up or down regulation of IDs genes in tumors Proves how important 
its tumor development, and therefore those proteins can be used as an indicator 
for CRC.

Stem cells possess the ability to differentiate into different lineages and the 
ability to self-renew, thus representing an excellent tool for regenerative 
medicine. They can be isolated from different tissues, including the adipose 
tissue. Adipose tissue and human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs) are 
privileged candidates for regenerative medicine procedures or other plastic 
reconstructive surgeries. The cellular environment is able to influence the fate 
of stem cells residing in the tissue. In a previous study, we exposed hADSCs to 
an exhausted medium of a breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) recovered at different 
days (4, 7, and 10 days). In the same paper, we inferred that the medium was 
able to influence the behaviour of stem cells. Considering these results, in the 
present study, we evaluated the expression of the major genes related to 
adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation. To confirm the gene expression data, 
oil red and alizarin red colorimetric assays were performed. Lastly, we 
evaluated the expression of miRNAs influencing the differentiation process and 
the proliferation rate, maintaining a proliferative state. The data obtained 
confirmed that cells exposed to the medium maintained a stem and proliferative 
state that could lead to a risky proliferative phenotype.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) stands as a major contributor to cancer-related 
fatalities within China. There is an urgent need to identify accurate biomarkers 
for recurrence predicting in CRC. Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing 
was used to perform a comparative analysis of methylation profiles in tissue 
samples from 30 recurrence to 30 non-recurrence patients with CRC. Least 
absolute shrinkage and selection operator method was performed to select the 
differential methylation regions (DMRs) and built a DNA methylation classifier 
for predicting recurrence. Based on the identified top DMRs, a methylation 
classifier was built and consisted of eight hypermethylated DMRs in CRC. The DNA 
methylation classifier showed high accuracy for predicting recurrence with an 
area under the receiver operator characteristic curve of 0.825 (95% CI 
0.680-0.970). The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated that CRC patients 
with high methylation risk score, evaluated by the DNA methylation classifier, 
had poorer survival than low risk score (Hazard Ratio 4.349; 95% CI 1.783-10.61, 
P = 0.002). And only CRC patients with low methylation risk score could acquire 
benefit from adjuvant therapy. The DNA methylation classifier has been proved as 
crucial biomarkers for predicting recurrence and exhibited promising prognostic 
value after curative surgery in patients with CRC.

Pediatric central nervous system tumors remain challenging to diagnose. Imaging 
approaches do not provide sufficient detail to discriminate between different 
tumor types, while the histopathological examination of tumor tissue shows high 
inter-observer variability. Recent studies have demonstrated the accurate 
classification of central nervous system tumors based on the DNA methylation 
profile of a tumor biopsy. However, a brain biopsy holds significant risk of 
bleeding and damaging the surrounding tissues. Liquid biopsy approaches 
analyzing circulating tumor DNA show high potential as an alternative and less 
invasive tool to study the DNA methylation pattern of tumors. Here, we explore 
the potential of classifying pediatric brain tumors based on methylation 
profiling of the circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). 
For this proof-of-concept study, we collected cerebrospinal fluid samples from 
19 pediatric brain cancer patients via a ventricular drain placed for reasons of 
increased intracranial pressure. Analyses on the cfDNA showed high variability 
of cfDNA quantities across patients ranging from levels below the limit of 
quantification to 40 ng cfDNA per milliliter of CSF. Classification based on 
methylation profiling of cfDNA from CSF was correct for 7 out of 20 samples in 
our cohort. Accurate results were mostly observed in samples of high quality, 
more specifically those with limited high molecular weight DNA contamination. 
Interestingly, we show that centrifugation of the CSF prior to processing 
increases the fraction of fragmented cfDNA to high molecular weight DNA. In 
addition, classification was mostly correct for samples with high tumoral cfDNA 
fraction as estimated by computational deconvolution (> 40%). In summary, 
analysis of cfDNA in the CSF shows potential as a tool for diagnosing pediatric 
nervous system tumors especially in patients with high levels of tumoral cfDNA 
in the CSF. Further optimization of the collection procedure, experimental 
workflow and bioinformatic approach is required to also allow classification for 
patients with low tumoral fractions in the CSF.

Genetic and epigenetic alterations occur in many physiological and pathological 
processes. The existing knowledge regarding the association of PIWI-interacting 
RNAs (piRNAs) and their genetic variants on risk and progression of prostate 
cancer (PCa) is limited. In this study, three genome-wide association study 
datasets are combined, including 85,707 PCa cases and 166,247 controls, to 
uncover genetic variants in piRNAs. Functional investigations involved 
manipulating piRNA expression in cellular and mouse models to study its 
oncogenetic role in PCa. A specific genetic variant, rs17201241 is identified, 
associated with increased expression of PROPER (piRNA overexpressed in prostate 
cancer) in tumors and are located within the gene, conferring an increased risk 
and malignant progression of PCa. Mechanistically, PROPER coupled with YTHDF2 to 
recognize N6-methyladenosine (m6A) and facilitated RNA-binding protein 
interactions between EIF2S3 at 5'-untranslated region (UTR) and YTHDF2/YBX3 at 
3'-UTR to promote DUSP1 circularization. This m6A-dependent mRNA-looping pattern 
enhanced DUSP1 degradation and inhibited DUSP1 translation, ultimately reducing 
DUSP1 expression and promoting PCa metastasis via the p38 mitogen-activated 
protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. Inhibition of PROPER expression using 
antagoPROPER effectively suppressed xenograft growth, suggesting its potential 
as a therapeutic target. Thus, targeting piRNA PROPER-mediated genetic and 
epigenetic fine control is a promising strategy for the concurrent prevention 
and treatment of PCa.

Global methylation analysis of gene promoters is promising for detection of 
high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions or worse (HSIL+) in high-risk human 
papillomavirus (hrHPV)-positive women. However, diagnostic performance of 
methylation data at individual CpG-sites is limited. We explored methylation for 
predicting HSIL+ in self- and clinician-collected samples from Papua New Guinea. 
Methylation of EPB41L3 (1-6 CpG-sites), hTERT (1-10 CpG-sites) and FAM19A4 (1-5 
CpG-sites) was assessed through pyrosequencing from 44 HPV+ samples (4 cancers, 
19 HSIL, 4 low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL), 17 normal). New 
primers were designed for FAM19A4 directed to the first exon region not explored 
previously. In clinician-collected samples, methylation at CpG-sites 4 and 5 of 
EPB41L3 were the best HSIL predictors (AUC >0.83) and CpG-site 4 for cancer 
(0.925). Combination of EPB41L3 sites 2/4 plus FAM19A4 site 1 were the best 
HSIL+ markers [100% sensitivity, 63.2% specificity]. Methylation at CpG-site 5 
of FAM19A4 was the best HSIL predictor (0.67) in self-collected samples, and 
CpG-sites 1 and 3 of FAM19A4 for cancer (0.77). Combined, FAM19A4 site 1 plus 
HPV 16/18 detection yielded sensitivity of 82.6% and specificity of 61.9%. In 
conclusion, methylation at individual CpG-sites of EPB41L3 and FAM19A4 
outperformed global analysis and improved HSIL+ detection, warranting further 
investigation.

OBJECTIVES: To explore genes in the nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 
antioxidative response elements (Nrf2-ARE) signaling pathway using a multiomics 
approach for associations with variability of cancer-related fatigue (CRF) in 
postmenopausal women with early-stage hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.
SAMPLE &AMP; SETTING: Postmenopausal women (N = 116) with early-stage hormone 
receptor-positive breast cancer were recruited from western Pennsylvania.
METHODS &AMP; VARIABLES: Candidate genes from the Nrf2-ARE pathway were 
investigated for associations with CRF occurrence and severity. Associations 
were evaluated using logistic regression for occurrence and linear regression 
for severity.
RESULTS: The rs2706110 TT genotype in NFE2L2 was associated with a 3.5-fold 
increase in odds of CRF occurrence. The cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) site 
cg22820568 in PRDX1 was associated with CRF occurrence and severity.
IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Biomarkers based on Nrf2-ARE genes may help to 
identify women at increased risk for more severe CRF and to develop targeted 
interventions.

Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a multifaceted condition influenced by sex, genetic 
and environmental factors that could be linked with epigenetic changes. 
Understanding how these factors interact is crucial to understand and address 
the development and progression of this disorder. Our aim was to elucidate 
different potential epigenetic and genetic mechanisms between women and men that 
correlate with OUD under real-world pain unit conditions. Associations between 
analgesic response and the DNA methylation level of the opioid mu receptor 
(OPRM1) gene (CpG sites 1-5 selected in the promoter region) were evaluated in 
345 long opioid-treated chronic non cancer pain: cases with OUD (n = 67) and 
controls (without OUD, n = 278). Cases showed younger ages, low employment 
status and quality of life, but higher morphine equivalent daily dose and 
psychotropic use, compared to the controls. The patients with OUD showed a 
significant decrease in OPRM1 DNA methylation, which correlated with clinical 
outcomes like pain relief, depression and different adverse events. Significant 
differences were found at the five CpG sites studied for men, and exclusively in 
women for CpG site 3, in relation to OUD diagnosis. These findings support the 
importance of epigenetics and sex as biological variables to be considered 
toward efficient OUD understanding and therapy development.

Breast cancer (BCa) is a prevalent form of cancer in women, exhibiting varying 
rates and distribution across different ethnic groups. Among these groups, 
African American (AA) women have the highest incidence of BCa and the lowest 
levels of Vitamin D (VD). Numerous studies have explored the connection between 
variations in the VDR gene and BCa risk, particularly in different populations, 
but research on the AA population remains limited. Epigenetic modifications, 
including specific microRNAs (miRNAs), can influence gene expression without 
altering the genetic code and have been implicated in cancer initiation and 
progression. Our hypothesis suggests that VDR gene variations may increase BCa 
risk in AA women and that changes in miRNA expression profiles could contribute 
to BCa development. Using data from the 1000 Genome Project, we identified five 
VDR gene variants with significant frequency differences between AA and 
European-American (EA) populations. We genotyped 404 African American BCa cases 
and controls for five variants using TaqMan® assays. SNPstats assessed their 
association with BCa risk. The rs1544410 variant's recessive model (A/A) showed 
a decreased BCa risk in AA (odds ratio 0.33, 95% CI: 0.15-0.73, p-value 0.0041). 
Conversely, the rs2853563 variant's recessive model (A/A) was linked to an 
increased BCa risk (odds ratio 4.04, 95% CI: 1.49-10.95, p-value 0.0022). We 
investigated miRNA expression influenced by VD in HCC1806 Triple-Negative Breast 
Cancer (TNBC) cell lines with the A/A allele for rs2853563. nCounter® Nanostring 
technology assessed miRNA profiles after calcitriol treatment. Our results 
indicated that calcitriol treatment led to reduced expression of six miRNAs, 
four of which are associated with tumor suppression in the presence of the AA 
genotype in TNBC cell lines. These findings suggest that specific VDR genotypes 
could have a potential effect on the miRNAs expression which could potentially 
serve as markers for cell proliferation in TNBC.

INTRODUCTION: Many pediatric urology conditions affect putatively normal tissues 
or appear too commonly to be based solely on specific DNA mutations. 
Understanding epigenetic mechanisms in pediatric urology, therefore, has many 
implications that can impact cell and tissue responses to settings, such as 
environmental and hormonal influences on urethral development, uropathogenic 
infections, obstructive stimuli, all of which originate externally or 
extracellularly. Indeed, the cell's response to external stimuli is often 
mediated epigenetically. In this commentary, we highlight work on the critical 
role that epigenetic machinery, such as DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), Enhancer 
of Zeste Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 Subunit (EZH2), and others play in 
regulating gene expression and cellular functions in three urological contexts.
DESIGN: Animal and cellular constructs were used to model clinical pediatric 
uropathology. The hypertrophy, trabeculation, and fibrosis of the chronically 
obstructed bladder was explored using smooth muscle cell models employing 
disorganised vs. normal extracellular matrix (ECM), as well as a new animal 
model of chronic obstructive bladder disease (COBD) which retains its pathologic 
features even after bladder de-obstruction. Cell models from human and murine 
hypospadias or genital tubercles (GT) were used to illustrate developmental 
responses and epigenetic dependency of key developmental genes. Finally, using 
bladder urothelial and organoid culture systems, we examined activity of 
epigenetic machinery in response to non uropathogenic vs. uropathogenic E.coli 
(UPEC). DNMT and EZH2 expression and function were interrogated in these model 
systems.
RESULTS: Disordered ECM exerted a principal mitogenic and epigenetic role for on 
bladder smooth muscle both in vitro and in CODB in vivo. Key genes, e.g., BDNF 
and KCNB2 were under epigenetic regulation in actively evolving obstruction and 
COBD, though each condition showed distinct epigenetic responses. In models of 
hypospadias, estrogen strongly dysregulated WNT and Hox expression, which was 
normalized by epigenetic inhibition. Finally, DNA methylation machinery in the 
urothelium showed specific activation when challenged by uropathogenic E.coli. 
Similarly, UPEC induces hypermethylation and downregulation of the growth 
suppressor p16INK4A. Moreover, host cells exposed to UPEC produced secreted 
factors inducing epigenetic responses transmissible from one affected cell to 
another without ongoing bacterial presence.
DISCUSSION: Microenvironmental influences altered epigenetic activity in the 
three described urologic contexts. Considering that many obstructed bladders 
continue to display abnormal architecture and dysfunction despite relief of 
obstruction similar to after resection of posterior valves or BPH, the 
epigenetic mechanisms described highlight novel approaches for understanding the 
underlying smooth muscle myopathy of this crucial clinical problem. Similarly, 
there is evidence for an epigenetic basis of xenoestrogen on development of 
hypospadias, and UTI-induced pan-urothelial alteration of epigenetic marks and 
propensity for subsequent (recurrent) UTI. The impact of mechanical, hormonal, 
infectious triggers on genitourinary epigenetic machinery activity invite novel 
avenues for targeting epigenetic modifications associated with these non-cancer 
diseases in urology. This includes the use of deactivated CRISPR-based 
technologies for precise epigenome targeting and editing. Overall, we underscore 
the importance of understanding epigenetic regulation in pediatric urology for 
the development of innovative therapeutic and management strategies.

CONTEXT: Atypical parathyroid tumor (APT) represents a neoplasm characterized by 
histological features typical of parathyroid carcinoma (PC) but lacking local 
infiltration and/or distant metastasis, leading to uncertainty regarding its 
malignant potential.
OBJECTIVE: To characterize the molecular landscape and deregulated pathways in 
APT.
METHODS: Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was conducted on 16 APTs. DNA from tumors 
and matched peripheral blood underwent WES using Illumina HiSeq3000.
RESULTS: A total of 192 nonsynonymous variants were identified. The median 
number of protein-altering mutations was 9. The most frequently mutated genes 
included BCOR, CLMN, EZH1, JAM2, KRTAP13-3, MUC16, MUC19, and OR1S1. Seventeen 
mutated genes belong to the Cancer Gene Census list. The most consistent hub 
genes identified through STRING network analysis were ATM, COL4A5, EZH2, MED12, 
MEN1, MTOR, PI3, PIK3CA, PIK3CB, and UBR5. Deregulated pathways included the PI3 
K/AKT/mTOR pathway, Wnt signaling, and extracellular matrix organization. 
Variants in genes such as MEN1, CDC73, EZH2, PIK3CA, and MTOR, previously 
reported as established or putative/candidate driver genes in benign adenoma 
(PA) and/or PC, were also identified in APT.
CONCLUSION: APT does not appear to have a specific molecular signature but 
shares genomic alterations with both PA and PC. The incidence of CDC73 mutations 
is low, and it remains unclear whether these mutations are associated with a 
higher risk of recurrence. Our study confirms that PI3 K/AKT/mTOR and Wnt 
signaling represents the pivotal pathways in parathyroid tumorigenesis and also 
revealed mutations in key epigenetic modifier genes (BCOR, KDM2A, MBD4, and 
EZH2) involved in chromatin remodeling, DNA, and histone methylation.

Genetic and epigenetic alterations are cancer hallmark characteristics. However, 
the role of inherited cancer predisposition alleles in co-opting lineage factor 
epigenetic reprogramming and tumor progression remains elusive. Here the FinnGen 
cohort phenome-wide analysis, along with multiple genome-wide association 
studies, has consistently identified the rs339331-RFX6/6q22 locus associated 
with prostate cancer (PCa) risk across diverse populations. It is uncovered that 
rs339331 resides in a reprogrammed androgen receptor (AR) binding site in PCa 
tumors, with the T risk allele enhancing AR chromatin occupancy. RFX6, an 
AR-regulated gene linked to rs339331, exhibits synergistic prognostic value for 
PCa recurrence and metastasis. This comprehensive in vitro and in vivo studies 
demonstrate the oncogenic functions of RFX6 in promoting PCa cell proliferation 
and metastasis. Mechanistically, RFX6 upregulates HOXA10 that profoundly 
correlates with adverse PCa outcomes and is pivotal in RFX6-mediated PCa 
progression, facilitating the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and 
modulating the TGFβ/SMAD signaling axis. Clinically, HOXA10 elevation is 
associated with increased EMT scores, tumor advancement and PCa recurrence. 
Remarkably, reducing RFX6 expression restores enzalutamide sensitivity in 
resistant PCa cells and tumors. This findings reveal a complex interplay of 
genetic and epigenetic mechanisms in PCa pathogenesis and drug resistance, 
centered around disrupted prostate lineage AR signaling and abnormal RFX6 
expression.

Many lifestyle-related diseases such as cancer, dementia, myocardial infarction, 
and stroke are known to be caused by aging, and the WHO's ICD-11 (International 
Classification of Diseases, 11th edition) created the code ""aging-related"" in 
2022. In other words, aging is irreversible but aging-related diseases are 
reversible, so taking measures to treat them is important for health longevity 
and preventing other diseases. Therefore, in this study, we used BioBran 
containing rice kefiran as an approach to improve aging. Rice kefiran has been 
reported to improve the intestinal microflora, regulate the intestines, and have 
anti-aging effects. BioBran has also been reported to have antioxidant effects 
and improve liver function, and human studies have shown that it affects the 
diversity of the intestinal microbiota. Quantitative measures of aging that 
correlate with disease risk are now available through the epigenetic clock test, 
which examines the entire gene sequence and determines biological age based on 
the methylation level. Horvath's Clock is the best known of many epigenetic 
clock tests and was published by Steve Horvath in 2013. In this study, we 
examine the effect of using Horvath's Clock to improve aging and report on the 
results, which show a certain effect.

DNA methylation plays an essential role in regulating gene activity, modulating 
disease risk, and determining treatment response. We can obtain insight into 
methylation patterns at a single-nucleotide level via next-generation sequencing 
technologies. However, complex features inherent in the data obtained via these 
technologies pose challenges beyond the typical big data problems. Identifying 
differentially methylated cytosines (dmc) or regions is one such challenge. We 
have developed DMCFB, an efficient dmc identification method based on Bayesian 
functional regression, to tackle these challenges. Using simulations, we 
establish that DMCFB outperforms current methods and results in better smoothing 
and efficient imputation. We analyzed a dataset of patients with acute 
promyelocytic leukemia and control samples. With DMCFB, we discovered many new 
dmcs and, more importantly, exhibited enhanced consistency of differential 
methylation within islands and their adjacent shores. Additionally, we detected 
differential methylation at more of the binding sites of the fused gene involved 
in this cancer.

Vulvar lichen sclerosus (LS) is an inflammatory dermatosis that can progress to 
human papillomavirus (HPV)-independent vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (HPVi 
VIN) and vulvar squamous cell carcinoma (VSCC). Although LS has a much lower 
cancer risk compared with HPVi VIN (5% vs 50%, respectively), its incidence is 
significantly higher. Therefore, there is a clinical need to identify LS 
patients with an increased cancer risk. Our objective was to study the value of 
DNA methylation and p53 immunohistochemistry (IHC) as prognostic biomarkers for 
progression to cancer in patients with LS. Vulvar tissues from 236 patients were 
selected, including 75 LS and 68 HPVi VIN, both with and without cancer 
development, 32 VSCC, and 61 healthy vulvar controls. Samples were subjected to 
p53 IHC and DNA methylation analysis of a 3-gene marker panel containing ZNF582, 
SST, and miR124-2. Methylation levels and p53 IHC status (mutant or wild-type) 
were assessed and compared among all disease categories. Odds ratios were 
determined to identify whether the biomarkers were associated with progression 
to cancer in patients with LS. The highest methylation levels were found in HPVi 
VIN and VSCC, followed by LS and healthy vulvar controls. The largest 
heterogeneity in methylation levels was observed in LS cases. In fact, the 
3-marker panel tested positive in 70% of LS, which progressed to VSCC vs only 
17% of LS in patients without cancer development (P = .002). Also, mutant p53 
IHC was observed more frequently in LS with progression to VSCC compared with 
nonprogressive LS cases (42% vs 3%, respectively, P = .001). Multivariable 
analysis identified a mutant p53 status as the only independent risk factor for 
cancer development in LS (odds ratio: 34.0, 95% CI: 1.4-807.4). In conclusion, 
DNA methylation testing and p53 IHC show strong potential as prognostic 
biomarkers for the identification of LS patients at high risk of progression to 
cancer.

Correlated regions of systemic interindividual variation (CoRSIV) represent a 
small proportion of the human genome showing DNA methylation patterns that are 
the same in all human tissues, are different among individuals, and are 
partially regulated by genetic variants in cis. In this study we aimed at 
investigating single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within CoRSIVs and their 
involvement with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) risk. We analyzed 
29,099 CoRSIV-SNPs and 133,615 CoRSIV-mQTLs in 14,394 cases and 247,022 controls 
of European and Asian descent. We observed that the A allele of the rs2976395 
SNP was associated with increased PDAC risk in Europeans (p = 2.81 × 10-5). This 
SNP lies in the prostate stem cell antigen gene and is in perfect linkage 
disequilibrium with a variant (rs2294008) that has been reported to be 
associated with risk of many other cancer types. The A allele is associated with 
the DNA methylation level of the gene according to the PanCan-meQTL database and 
with overexpression according to QTLbase. The expression of the gene has been 
observed to be deregulated in many tumors of the gastrointestinal tract 
including pancreatic cancer; however, functional studies are needed to elucidate 
the function relevance of the association.

PURPOSE: Generation Scotland (GS) is a large family-based cohort study 
established as a longitudinal resource for research into the genetic, lifestyle 
and environmental determinants of physical and mental health. It comprises 
extensive genetic, sociodemographic and clinical data from volunteers in 
Scotland.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 24 084 adult participants, including 5501 families, 
were recruited between 2006 and 2011. Within the cohort, 59% (approximately 14 
209) are women, with an average age at recruitment of 49 years. Participants 
completed a health questionnaire and attended an in-person clinic visit, where 
detailed baseline data were collected on lifestyle information, cognitive 
function, personality traits and mental and physical health. Genotype array data 
are available for 20 026 (83%) participants, and blood-based DNA methylation 
(DNAm) data for 18 869 (78%) participants. Linkage to routine National Health 
Service datasets has been possible for 93% (n=22 402) of the cohort, creating a 
longitudinal resource that includes primary care, hospital attendance, 
prescription and mortality records. Multimodal brain imaging is available in 
1069 individuals.
FINDINGS TO DATE: GS has been widely used by researchers across the world to 
study the genetic and environmental basis of common complex diseases. Over 350 
peer-reviewed papers have been published using GS data, contributing to research 
areas such as ageing, cancer, cardiovascular disease and mental health. 
Recontact studies have built on the GS cohort to collect additional prospective 
data to study chronic pain, major depressive disorder and COVID-19.
FUTURE PLANS: To create a larger, richer, longitudinal resource, 'Next 
Generation Scotland' launched in May 2022 to expand the existing cohort by a 
target of 20 000 additional volunteers, now including anyone aged 12+ years. New 
participants complete online consent and questionnaires and provide postal 
saliva samples, from which genotype and salivary DNAm array data will be 
generated. The latest cohort information and how to access data can be found on 
the GS website (www.generationscotland.org).

Insufficient telomerase activity, stemming from low telomerase reverse 
transcriptase (TERT) gene transcription, contributes to telomere dysfunction and 
aging pathologies. Besides its traditional function in telomere synthesis, TERT 
acts as a transcriptional co-regulator of genes pivotal in aging and 
age-associated diseases. Here, we report the identification of a TERT activator 
compound (TAC) that upregulates TERT transcription via the MEK/ERK/AP-1 cascade. 
In primary human cells and naturally aged mice, TAC-induced elevation of TERT 
levels promotes telomere synthesis, blunts tissue aging hallmarks with reduced 
cellular senescence and inflammatory cytokines, and silences p16INK4a expression 
via upregulation of DNMT3B-mediated promoter hypermethylation. In the brain, TAC 
alleviates neuroinflammation, increases neurotrophic factors, stimulates adult 
neurogenesis, and preserves cognitive function without evident toxicity, 
including cancer risk. Together, these findings underscore TERT's critical role 
in aging processes and provide preclinical proof of concept for physiological 
TERT activation as a strategy to mitigate multiple aging hallmarks and 
associated pathologies.

Exposure to environmental carcinogens is a significant contributor to cancer 
development, with genetic and epigenetic alterations playing pivotal roles in 
the carcinogenic process. However, the interplay between epigenetic regulation 
and genetic changes in carcinogenesis has yet to receive comprehensive 
attention. This study investigates the impact of continuous exposure to the 
tobacco-specific carcinogen 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) 
on bronchial epithelial cells, leading to malignant transformation. Our findings 
reveal the down-regulation of the tumor suppressor-like circular RNA circNIPBL 
during oncogenic processes concomitant with the accumulation of the TP53-H179R, 
a single nucleotide variant. Diminished circNIPBL expression enhances the 
proliferative, distant metastatic, and tumor-forming capabilities of NNK-induced 
cancerous cells and lung cancer cell lines (A549, H1299), while also promoting 
the accumulation of TP53-H179R during NNK-induced carcinogenesis. Mechanistic 
investigations demonstrate that circNIPBL interacts with HSP90α to regulate the 
translocation of AHR into the nucleus, which may be a potential regulatory 
mechanism for NNK-induced carcinogenesis and TP53-H179R accumulation. This study 
introduces a novel perspective on the interplay between genetic alterations and 
epigenetic regulation in chemical carcinogenesis, which provides novel insight 
into the etiology of cancer.

BACKGROUND: Prenatal folate supplementation has been consistently associated 
with a reduced risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Previous 
germline genetic studies examining the one carbon (folate) metabolism pathway 
were limited in sample size, scope, and population diversity and led to 
inconclusive results.
METHODS: We evaluated whether ∼2,900 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) 
within 46 candidate genes involved in the folate metabolism pathway influence 
the risk of childhood ALL, using genome-wide data from nine case-control studies 
in the Childhood Cancer and Leukemia International Consortium (n = 9,058 cases 
including 4,510 children of European ancestry, 3,018 Latinx, and 1,406 Asians, 
and 92,364 controls). Each study followed a standardized protocol for quality 
control and imputation of genome-wide data and summary statistics were 
meta-analyzed for all children combined and by major ancestry group using METAL 
software.
RESULTS: None of the selected SNPs reached statistical significance, overall and 
for major ancestry groups (using adjusted Bonferroni P-value of 5 × 10-6 and 
less-stringent P-value of 3.5 × 10-5 accounting for the number of ""independent"" 
SNPs). None of the 10 top (nonsignificant) SNPs and corresponding genes 
overlapped across ancestry groups.
CONCLUSIONS: This large meta-analysis of original data does not reveal 
associations between many common genetic variants in the folate metabolism 
pathway and childhood ALL in various ancestry groups.
IMPACT: Genetic variants in the folate pathway alone do not appear to 
substantially influence childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia risk. Other 
mechanisms such as gene-folate interaction, DNA methylation, or maternal genetic 
effects may explain the observed associations with self-reported prenatal folate 
intake.

Background: Metastasis and immunosuppression result in unfavorable prognosis in 
bladder cancer (BLCA). FGL1 and FGL2 are two members of the fibrinogen-related 
proteins family, but their potential effects on BLCA remain elusive. Methods: 
The expression profile of FGL1 and FGL2 in BLCA was analyzed in multiple 
databases. Furthermore, the expression of FGL2 was validated in BLCA tissues. 
The predictive capability of FGL2 was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier analysis, 
univariate analysis, and multivariate Cox regression. A nomogram model was 
constructed based on FGL2 expression and clinicopathological parameters for 
clinical practice. Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes 
(KEGG), and Gene Set Enrichment Analyses (GSEA) were performed to investigate 
enrichment in the biological processes. In addition, the correlation between 
FGL2 and immunological characteristics in the BLCA tumor microenvironment (TME), 
including tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TICs), cancer-immunity cycles, immune 
checkpoint molecules (ICPs), immunophenoscores (IPS), and response to anti-PD-L1 
immunotherapy was further analyzed. Results: FGL2 was found to be downregulated 
in BLCA due to hypermethylation of the FGL2 promoter region, which was 
associated with an unfavorable prognosis. Moreover, BLCA patients with high FGL2 
expression exhibited better response to immunotherapy. Conclusions: Our research 
revealed that FGL2 was downregulated in BLCA and was negatively correlated with 
DNA methylation. High FGL2 expression was confirmed as an independent risk for 
prognosis. Moreover, FGL2 is a promising indicator for the response to 
immunotherapy in patients with BLCA.

Lung cancer exhibits sex-biased molecular characteristics and epidemiological 
trends, suggesting a need for sex-specific approaches to understanding its 
etiology and treatment. DNA methylation alterations play critical roles in lung 
carcinogenesis and may serve as valuable biomarkers for precision medicine 
strategies. We employed the Infinium MethylationEPIC array to identify autosomal 
sex-related differentially methylated CpG sites (DM-CpGs) in lung epithelium of 
healthy individuals (32 females and 37 males) while controlling for age, BMI, 
and tobacco use. We correlated DM-CpGs with gene expression in lung epithelium 
and immune responses in bronchoalveolar lavage. We validated these DM-CpGs in 
lung tumors and adjacent normal tissue from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). 
Among 522 identified DM-CpGs, 61% were hypermethylated in females, predominantly 
located in promoter regions. These DM genes were implicated in cell-to-cell 
signaling, cellular function, transport, and lipid metabolism. Correlation 
analysis revealed sex-specific patterns between DM-CpGs and gene expression. 
Additionally, several DM-CpGs were correlated significantly with cytokines 
(IL-1β, IL-4, IL-12p70, and IFN-γ), macrophage, and lymphocyte counts. Also, 
some DM-CpGs were observed in TCGA lung adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, 
and adjacent normal tissues. Our findings highlight sex-specific DNA methylation 
patterns in healthy lung epithelium and their associations with lung gene 
expression and lung immune biomarkers. These findings underscore the potential 
role of lung sex-related CpGs as epigenetic predispositions influencing sex 
disparities in lung cancer risk and outcomes, warranting further investigation 
for personalized lung cancer management strategies.

DNA methylation is an epigenetic process that commonly occurs in genes' 
promoters and results in the transcriptional silencing of genes. DNA methylation 
is a frequent event in bladder cancer, participating in tumor initiation and 
progression. Bladder cancer is a major health issue in patients suffering from 
neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD), although the pathogenetic 
mechanisms of the disease remain unclear. In this population, bladder cancer is 
characterized by aggressive histopathology, advanced stage during diagnosis, and 
high mortality rates. To assess the DNA methylation profiles of five genes' 
promoters previously known to be associated with bladder cancer in bladder 
tissue of NLUTD patients, we conducted a prospective study recruiting NLUTD 
patients from the neuro-urology unit of a public teaching hospital. Cystoscopy 
combined with biopsy for bladder cancer screening was performed in all patients 
following written informed consent being obtained. Quantitative 
methylation-specific PCR was used to determine the methylation status of RASSF1, 
RARβ, DAPK, hTERT, and APC genes' promoters in bladder tissue samples. 
Twenty-four patients suffering from mixed NLUTD etiology for a median duration 
of 10 (IQR: 12) years were recruited in this study. DNA hypermethylation was 
detected in at least one gene of the panel in all tissue samples. RAR-β was 
hypermethylated in 91.7% samples, RASSF and DAPK were hypermethylated in 83.3% 
samples, APC 37.5% samples, and TERT in none of the tissue samples. In 45.8% of 
the samples, three genes of the panel were hypermethylated, in 29.2% four genes 
were hypermethylated, and in 16.7% and in 8.3% of the samples, two and one gene 
were hypermethylated, respectively. The number of hypermethylated genes of the 
panel was significantly associated with recurrent UTIs (p = 0.0048). No other 
significant association was found between DNA hypermethylation or the number of 
hypermethylated genes and the clinical characteristics of the patients. 
Histopathological findings were normal in 8.3% of patients, while chronic 
inflammation was found in 83.3% of patients and squamous cell metaplasia in 
16.7% of patients. In this study, we observed high rates of DNA hypermethylation 
of genes associated with bladder cancer in NLUTD patients, suggesting an 
epigenetic field effect and possible risk of bladder cancer development. 
Recurrent UTIs seem to be associated with increased DNA hypermethylation. 
Further research is needed to evaluate the impact of recurrent UTIs and chronic 
inflammation in DNA hypermethylation and bladder cancer etiopathogenesis in 
NLUTD patients.

BACKGROUND: Tumor hypoxia is associated with prostate cancer (PCa) treatment 
resistance and poor prognosis. Pimonidazole (PIMO) is an investigational hypoxia 
probe used in clinical trials. A better understanding of the clinical 
significance and molecular alterations underpinning PIMO-labeled tumor hypoxia 
is needed for future clinical application. Here, we investigated the clinical 
significance and molecular alterations underpinning PIMO-labeled tumor hypoxia 
in patients with localized PCa, in order to apply PIMO as a prognostic tool and 
to identify potential biomarkers for future clinical translation.
METHODS: A total of 39 patients with localized PCa were recruited and 
administered oral PIMO before undergoing radical prostatectomy (RadP). 
Immunohistochemical staining for PIMO was performed on 37 prostatectomy 
specimens with staining patterns evaluated and clinical association analyzed. 
Whole genome bisulfite sequencing was performed using laser-capture of 
microdissected specimen sections comparing PIMO positive and negative tumor 
areas. A hypoxia related methylation molecular signature was generated by 
integrating the differentially methylated regions with previously established 
RNA-seq datasets.
RESULTS: Three PIMO staining patterns were distinguished: diffuse, focal, and 
comedo-like. The comedo-like staining pattern was more commonly associated with 
adverse pathology. PIMO-defined hypoxia intensity was positively correlated with 
advanced pathologic stage, tumor invasion, and cribriform and intraductal 
carcinoma morphology. The generated DNA methylation signature was found to be a 
robust hypoxia biomarker, which could risk-stratify PCa patients across multiple 
clinical datasets, as well as be applicable in other cancer types.
CONCLUSIONS: Oral PIMO unveiled clinicopathologic features of disease 
aggressiveness in localized PCa. The generated DNA methylation signature is a 
novel and robust hypoxia biomarker that has the potential for future clinical 
translation.

Kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) is a cancer that is closely associated 
with epigenetic alterations, and histone modifiers (HMs) are closely related to 
epigenetic regulation. Therefore, this study aimed to comprehensively explore 
the function and prognostic value of HMs-based signature in KIRC. HMs were first 
obtained from top journal. Then, the mRNA expression profiles and clinical 
information in KIRC samples were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) 
database and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets. Cox regression analysis and 
least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) analysis were 
implemented to find prognosis-related HMs and construct a risk model related to 
the prognosis in KIRC. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to determine prognostic 
differences between high- and low-risk groups. Immune infiltration and drug 
sensitivity analysis were also performed between high- and low-risk groups. 
Eventually, 8 HMs were successfully identified for the construction of a risk 
model in KIRC. The results of the correlation analysis between risk signature 
and the prognosis showed HMs-based signature has good prognostic value in KIRC. 
Results of immune analysis of risk models showed there were significant 
differences in the level of immune cell infiltration and expression of immune 
checkpoints between high- and low-risk groups. The results of the drug 
sensitivity analysis showed that the high-risk group was more sensitive to 
several chemotherapeutic agents such as Sunitinib, Tipifarnib, Nilotinib and 
Bosutinib than the low-risk group. In conclusion, we successfully constructed 
HMs-based prognostic signature that can predict the prognosis of KIRC.

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is the primary risk factor for the 
pathogenesis of gastric cancer (GC). N6-methyladenosine (m6A) plays pivotal 
roles in mRNA metabolism and hnRNPA2B1 as an m6A reader is shown to exert 
m6A-dependent mRNA stabilization in cancer. This study aims to explore the role 
of hnRNPA2B1 in H. pylori-associated GC and its novel molecular mechanism. 
Multiple datasets and tissue microarray are utilized for assessing hnRNPA2B1 
expression in response to H. pylori infection and its clinical prognosis in 
patients with GC. The roles of hnRNPA2B1 are investigated through a variety of 
techniques including glucose metabolism analysis, m6A-epitranscriptomic 
microarray, Ribo-seq, polysome profiling, RIP-seq. In addition, hnRNPA2B1 
interaction with poly(A) binding protein cytoplasmic 1 (PABPC1) is validated 
using mass spectrometry and co-IP. These results show that hnRNPA2B1 is 
upregulated in GC and correlated with poor prognosis. H. pylori infection 
induces hnRNPA2B1 upregulation through recruiting NF-κB to its promoter. 
Intriguingly, cytoplasm-anchored hnRNPA2B1 coordinated PABPC1 to stabilize its 
relationship with cap-binding eIF4F complex, which facilitated the translation 
of CIP2A, DLAT and GPX1 independent of m6A modification. In summary, hnRNPA2B1 
facilitates the non-m6A translation of epigenetic mRNAs in GC progression by 
interacting with PABPC1-eIF4F complex and predicts poor prognosis for patients 
with GC.

BACKGROUND: Older patients are at risk for acute kidney injury and chronic 
kidney disease. Age-related increases in DNA methylation at CpG islands have 
been linked to aging-related diseases like cancer and cardiovascular disease, 
but the exact causal relationship between methylation in renal aging and other 
kidney diseases remains unclear. This study aimed to elucidate the methylation 
status of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in the Asian population. 
Using human whole blood DNA methylation analysis from the Taiwan Biobank, we 
included participants with both whole blood genome-wide methylation data and 
follow-up data on serum creatinine. We investigated hyper- and hypomethylated 
genes in comparison of participants with higher and lower estimated glomerular 
filtration (eGFR) decline rate in overall cohort as well as in comparison of old 
and young participants in subgroup of participants with higher eGFR decline 
rate. Common genes and signaling pathways in both comparative analyses were 
identified.
RESULTS: Among 1587 participants in the analysis, 187 participants had higher 
eGFR decline rate. According to the comparison of methylation in participants 
with different eGFR declines and at different ages, respectively, we identified 
common hypermethylated genes, including DNMT3A and GGACT, as well as 
hypomethylated genes such as ARL6IP5, CYB5D1, BCL6, RPRD2, ZNF451, and MIAT in 
both participants with higher eGFR decline and those of older age. We observed 
associations between the methylation status of signaling pathways and aging as 
well as renal function decline. These pathways notably included autophagy, p38 
mitogen-activated protein kinases, and sirtuins, which were associated with 
autophagy process and cytokine production.
CONCLUSIONS: Through methylation analysis of PBMCs, we identified genes and 
signaling pathways which could play crucial roles in the interplay of renal 
aging and renal function decline. These findings contribute to the development 
of novel biomarkers for identifying at-risk groups and even for therapeutic 
agent discovery.

BACKGROUND: Innate/adaptive immunity is the key to anti-tumor therapy. However, 
its causal relationship to Gastrointestinal (GI) cancer remains unclear.
METHODS: Immunity genes were extracted from the MSigDB database. The Genome-wide 
association studies (GWAS) summary data of GI cancer were integrated with 
expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and DNA methylation quantitative trait 
loci (mQTL) associated with genes. Summary-data-based Mendelian randomization 
(SMR) and co-localization analysis were used to reveal causal relationships 
between genes and GI cancer. Two-sample MR analysis was used for sensitivity 
analysis. Single cell analysis clarified the enrichment of genes.
RESULTS: Three-step SMR analysis showed that a putative mechanism, cg17294865 
CpG site regulating HLA-DRA expression was negatively associated with gastric 
cancer risk. HLA-DRA was significantly differentially expressed in 
monocyte/macrophage and myeloid cells in gastric cancer.
CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that upregulating the expression level 
of HLA-DRA can reduce the risk of gastric cancer.

A sedentary lifestyle and Olympic participation are contrary risk factors for 
global mortality and incidence of cancer and cardiovascular disease. 
Extracellular vesicle miRNAs have been described to respond to exercise. No 
molecular characterization of young male sedentary people versus athletes is 
available; so, our aim was to identify the extracellular vesicle miRNA profile 
of chronically trained young endurance and resistance male athletes compared to 
their sedentary counterparts. A descriptive case-control design was used with 16 
sedentary young men, 16 Olympic male endurance athletes, and 16 Olympic male 
resistance athletes. Next-generation sequencing and RT-qPCR and external and 
internal validation were performed in order to analyze extracellular vesicle 
miRNA profiles. Endurance and resistance athletes had significant lower levels 
of miR-16-5p, miR-19a-3p, and miR-451a compared to sedentary people. Taking all 
together, exercise-trained miRNA profile in extracellular vesicles provides a 
differential signature of athletes irrespective of the type of exercise compared 
to sedentary people. Besides, miR-25-3p levels were specifically lower in 
endurance athletes which defines its role as a specific responder in this type 
of athletes. In silico analysis of this profile suggests a role in adaptive 
energy metabolism in this context that needs to be experimentally validated. 
Therefore, this study provides for the first time basal levels of circulating 
miRNA in extracellular vesicles emerge as relevant players in intertissue 
communication in response to chronic exercise exposure in young elite male 
athletes.

Aim: Liquid biopsies analyzing cell-free DNA (cfDNA) methylation in plasma offer 
a noninvasive diagnostic for diseases, with the potential of aging biomarkers 
underexplored. Methods: Utilizing enzymatic methyl-seq (EM-seq), this study 
assessed cfDNA methylation patterns in aging with blood from 35 healthy 
individuals. Results: It found aging signatures, including higher cfDNA levels 
and variations in fragment sizes, plus approximately 2000 age-related 
differentially methylated CpG sites. A biological age predictive model based on 
48 CpG sites showed a strong correlation with chronological age, verified by two 
datasets. Age-specific epigenetic shifts linked to inflammation were revealed 
through differentially methylated regions profiling and Olink proteomics. 
Conclusion: These findings suggest cfDNA methylation as a potential aging 
biomarker and might exacerbate immunoinflammatory reactivity in older 
individuals.

Plain Language Summary: Our bodies undergo many changes as we age, some of which 
might affect our health. To better understand these changes, scientists study 
something called ‘cell-free DNA' (cfDNA) in our blood. This cfDNA can give us 
clues about our health and the risk of diseases like cancer or heart 
conditions.In our research, we analyzed cfDNA from the blood of 35 people to 
identify patterns associated with aging. We discovered that approximately 2000 
specific spots in our DNA change in a way that's linked to aging. These changes 
might help us figure out someone's biological age – essentially, how old their 
body seems based on various health factors, which can differ from their actual 
age.We also found that these DNA changes could indicate how aging might make the 
body's defense system – which fights off diseases – react more intensely. 
Understanding this could be crucial for managing health as we get older.Our 
study suggests that cfDNA could be a useful marker for aging, offering a new 
approach to understanding and possibly managing the health effects associated 
with growing older.

Environmental exposure to the cadmium (Cd) has been shown to be a risk factor 
for colorectal cancer (CRC) progression, but the exact mechanism has not been 
fully elucidated. In this study, we found that chronic Cd (3 μM) exposure 
promoted the proliferation, adhesion, migration, and invasion of CRC cells in 
vitro, as well as lung metastasis in vivo. RNA-seq and TCGA-COAD datasets 
revealed that decreased hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase trifunctional multienzyme 
complex subunit beta (HADHB) expression may be a crucial factor in Cd-induced 
CRC progression. Further analysis using qRT-PCR and tissue microarrays from CRC 
patients showed that HADHB expression was significantly reduced in CRC tissues 
compared to adjacent normal tissues, and low HADHB expression was associated 
with adverse clinical features and poor overall survival, either directly or 
through TNM stage. Furthermore, HADHB was found to play an important role in the 
Cd-induced malignant metastatic phenotype of CRC cells and lung metastasis in 
mice. Mechanistically, we discovered that chronic Cd exposure resulted in 
hypermethylation of the HADHB promoter region via inhibition of DNA demethylase 
tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 (TET2), which then led to decreased HADHB 
expression and activation of the FAK signaling pathway, and ultimately 
contributed to CRC progression. In conclusion, this study provided a new 
potential insight and evaluable biomarker for Cd exposure-induced CRC 
progression and treatment.

BACKGROUND: Psoriasis extends beyond its dermatological inflammatory 
manifestations, encompassing systemic inflammation. Existing studies have 
indicated a potential risk of cervical cancer among patients with psoriasis, 
suggesting a potential mechanism of co-morbidity. This study aims to explore the 
key genes, pathways, and immune cells that may link psoriasis and cervical 
squamous cell carcinoma (CESC).
METHODS: The cervical squamous cell carcinoma dataset (GSE63514) was downloaded 
from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Two psoriasis-related datasets (GSE13355 
and GSE14905) were merged into one comprehensive dataset after removing batch 
effects. Differentially expressed genes were identified using Limma and 
co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), and machine learning random forest 
algorithm (RF) was used to screen the hub genes. We analyzed relevant gene 
enrichment pathways using GO and KEGG, and immune cell infiltration in psoriasis 
and CESC samples using CIBERSORT. The miRNA-mRNA and TFs-mRNA regulatory 
networks were then constructed using Cytoscape, and the biomarkers for psoriasis 
and CESC were determined. Potential drug targets were obtained from the cMAP 
database, and biomarker expression levels in hela and psoriatic cell models were 
quantified by RT-qPCR.
RESULTS: In this study, we identified 27 key genes associated with psoriasis and 
cervical squamous cell carcinoma. NCAPH, UHRF1, CDCA2, CENPN and MELK were 
identified as hub genes using the Random Forest machine learning algorithm. 
Chromosome mitotic region segregation, nucleotide binding and DNA methylation 
are the major enrichment pathways for common DEGs in the mitotic cell cycle. 
Then we analyzed immune cell infiltration in psoriasis and cervical squamous 
cell carcinoma samples using CIBERSORT. Meanwhile, we used the cMAP database to 
identify ten small molecule compounds that interact with the central gene as 
drug candidates for treatment. By analyzing miRNA-mRNA and TFs-mRNA regulatory 
networks, we identified three miRNAs and nine transcription factors closely 
associated with five key genes and validated their expression in external 
validation datasets and clinical samples. Finally, we examined the diagnostic 
effects with ROC curves, and performed experimental validation in hela and 
psoriatic cell models.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified five biomarkers, NCAPH, UHRF1, CDCA2, CENPN, and 
MELK, which may play important roles in the common pathogenesis of psoriasis and 
cervical squamous cell carcinoma, furthermore predict potential therapeutic 
agents. These findings open up new perspectives for the diagnosis and treatment 
of psoriasis and squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix.

The intestinal microbiota is an important environmental factor implicated in CRC 
development. Intriguingly, modulation of DNA methylation by gut microbiota has 
been reported in preclinical models, although the relationship between 
tumor-infiltrating bacteria and CIMP status is currently unexplored. In this 
study, we investigated tumor-associated bacteria in 203 CRC tumor cases and 
validated the findings using The Cancer Genome Atlas datasets. We assessed the 
abundance of Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli, Fusobacterium nucleatum, 
and Klebsiella pneumoniae through qPCR analysis and observed enrichment of all 
four bacterial species in CRC samples. Notably, except for E. coli, all 
exhibited significant enrichment in cases of CIMP. This enrichment was primarily 
driven by a subset of cases distinguished by high levels of these bacteria, 
which we labeled as ""Superhigh"". The bacterial Superhigh status showed a 
significant association with CIMP (odds ratio 3.1, p-value = 0.013) and with 
MLH1 methylation (odds ratio 4.2, p-value = 0.0025). In TCGA CRC cases (393 
tumor and 45 adj. normal), bacterial taxa information was extracted from 
non-human whole exome sequencing reads, and the bacterial Superhigh status was 
similarly associated with CIMP (odds ratio 2.9, p < 0.001) and MLH1 methylation 
(odds ratio 3.5, p < 0.001). Finally, 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing revealed 
high enrichment of Bergeyella spp. C. concisus, and F. canifelinum in 
CIMP-Positive tumor cases. Our findings highlight that specific bacterial taxa 
may influence DNA methylation, particularly in CpG islands, and contribute to 
the development and progression of CIMP in colorectal cancer.

Germ cell tumors (GCT) are the most common solid tumors in young men of age 15 - 
40. In previous studies, we profiled the interaction of GCT cells with cells of 
the tumor microenvironment (TM), which showed that especially the 3D interaction 
of fibroblasts (FB) or macrophages with GCT cells influenced the growth behavior 
and cisplatin response as well as the transcriptome and secretome of the tumor 
cells, suggesting that the crosstalk of these cells with GCT cells is crucial 
for tumor progression and therapy outcome. In this study, we shed light on the 
mechanisms of activation of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) in the GCT 
setting and their effects on GCT cells lines and the monocyte cell line THP-1. 
Ex vivo cultures of GCT-derived CAF were established and characterized 
molecularly and epigenetically by performing DNA methylation arrays, RNA 
sequencing, and mass spectrometry-based secretome analysis. We demonstrated that 
the activation state of CAF is influenced by their former prevailing tumor 
environment in which they have resided. Hereby, we postulate that seminoma (SE) 
and embryonal carcinoma (EC) activate CAF, while teratoma (TER) play only a 
minor role in CAF formation. In turn, CAF influence proliferation and the 
expression of cisplatin sensitivity-related factors in GCT cells lines as well 
as polarization of in vitro-induced macrophages by the identified effector 
molecules IGFBP1, LGALS3BP, LYVE1, and PTX3. Our data suggests that the vital 
interaction of CAF with GCT cells and with macrophages has a huge influence on 
shaping the extracellular matrix as well as on recruitment of immune cells to 
the TM. In conclusion, therapeutically interfering with CAF and / or macrophages 
in addition to the standard therapy might slow-down progression of GCT and 
re-shaping of the TM to a tumor-promoting environment. Significance: The 
interaction of CAF with GCT and macrophages considerably influences the 
microenvironment. Thus, therapeutically interfering with CAF might slow-down 
progression of GCT and re-shaping of the microenvironment to a tumor-promoting 
environment.

By analyzing 15,000 samples from 348 mammalian species, we derive DNA 
methylation (DNAm) predictors of maximum life span (R = 0.89), gestation time (R 
= 0.96), and age at sexual maturity (R = 0.85). Our maximum life-span predictor 
indicates a potential innate longevity advantage for females over males in 17 
mammalian species including humans. The DNAm maximum life-span predictions are 
not affected by caloric restriction or partial reprogramming. Genetic 
disruptions in the somatotropic axis such as growth hormone receptors have an 
impact on DNAm maximum life span only in select tissues. Cancer mortality rates 
show no correlation with our epigenetic estimates of life-history traits. The 
DNAm maximum life-span predictor does not detect variation in life span between 
individuals of the same species, such as between the breeds of dogs. Maximum 
life span is determined in part by an epigenetic signature that is an intrinsic 
species property and is distinct from the signatures that relate to individual 
mortality risk.

Objective: DNA methylation is an essential epigenetic marker governed by DNA 
methyltransferases (DNMTs), which can influence cancer onset and progression. 
However, few studies have provided an integrated analysis of the relevance of 
DNMT family genes to cell stemness, the tumor microenvironment (TME), and 
immunotherapy biomarkers across diverse cancers. Methods: This study 
investigated the impact of five DNMTs on transcriptional profiles, prognosis, 
and their association with Ki67 expression, epithelial-mesenchymal transition 
signatures, stemness scores, the TME, and immunological markers across 31 cancer 
types from recognized public databases. Results: The results indicated that 
DNMT1/DNMT3B/DNMT3A expression increased, whereas TRDMT1/DNMT3L expression 
decreased in most cancer types. DNMT family genes were identified as prognostic 
risk factors for numerous cancers, as well as being prominently associated with 
immune, stromal, and ESTIMATE scores, as well as with immune-infiltrating cell 
levels. Expression of the well-known immune checkpoints, PDCD1 and CILA4, was 
noticeably related to DNMT1/DNMT3A/DNMT3B expression. Finally, we validated the 
role of DNMT1 in MCF-7 and HepG2-C3A cell lines through its knockdown, 
whereafter a decrease in cell proliferation and migration ability in vitro was 
observed. Conclusion: Our study comprehensively expounded that DNMT family genes 
not only behave as promising prognostic factors but also have the potential to 
serve as therapeutic targets in cancer immunotherapy for various types of 
cancer.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) arises from complex interactions between 
host and environment, which include the gut and tissue microbiome. It is 
hypothesized that epigenetic regulation by gut microbiota is a fundamental 
interface by which commensal microbes dynamically influence intestinal biology. 
The aim of this study is to explore the interplay between gut and tissue 
microbiota and host DNA methylation in CRC.
METHODS: Metagenomic sequencing of fecal samples was performed on matched CRC 
patients (n = 18) and healthy controls (n = 18). Additionally, tissue microbiome 
was profiled with 16S rRNA gene sequencing on tumor (n = 24) and tumor-adjacent 
normal (n = 24) tissues of CRC patients, while host DNA methylation was assessed 
through whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) in a subset of 13 individuals.
RESULTS: Our analysis revealed substantial alterations in the DNA methylome of 
CRC tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues. An extensive meta-analysis, 
incorporating publicly available and in-house data, identified significant 
shifts in microbial-derived methyl donor-related pathways between tumor and 
adjacent normal tissues. Of note, we observed a pronounced enrichment of 
microbial-associated CpGs within the promoter regions of genes in adjacent 
normal tissues, a phenomenon notably absent in tumor tissues. Furthermore, we 
established consistent and recurring associations between methylation patterns 
of tumor-related genes and specific bacterial taxa.
CONCLUSIONS: This study emphasizes the pivotal role of the gut microbiota and 
pathogenic bacteria in dynamically shaping DNA methylation patterns, impacting 
physiological homeostasis, and contributing to CRC tumorigenesis. These findings 
provide valuable insights into the intricate host-environment interactions in 
CRC development and offer potential avenues for therapeutic interventions in 
this disease.

BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer is one of the most common tumors worldwide, and most 
patients are deprived of treatment options when diagnosed at advanced stages. 
PRDM14 has carcinogenic potential in breast and non-small cell lung cancer. 
however, its role in gastric cancer has not been elucidated.
METHODS: We aimed to elucidate the expression of PRDM14 using pan-cancer 
analysis. We monitored the expression of PRDM14 in cells and patients using 
quantitative polymerase chain reaction, western blotting, and 
immunohistochemistry. We observed that cell phenotypes and regulatory genes were 
influenced by PRDM14 by silencing PRDM14. We evaluated and validated the value 
of the PRDM14-derived prognostic model. Finally, we predicted the relationship 
between PRDM14 and small-molecule drug responses using the Connectivity Map and 
The Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer databases.
RESULTS: PRDM14 was significantly overexpressed in gastric cancer, which 
identified in cell lines and patients' tissues. Silencing the expression of 
PRDM14 resulted in apoptosis promotion, cell cycle arrest, and inhibition of the 
growth and migration of GC cells. Functional analysis revealed that PRDM14 acts 
in epigenetic regulation and modulates multiple DNA methyltransferases or 
transcription factors. The PRDM14-derived differentially expressed gene 
prognostic model was validated to reliably predict the patient prognosis. 
Nomograms (age, sex, and PRDM14-risk score) were used to quantify the 
probability of survival. PRDM14 was positively correlated with sensitivity to 
small-molecule drugs such as TPCA-1, PF-56,227, mirin, and linsitinib.
CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our findings suggest that PRDM14 is a positive 
regulator of gastric cancer progression. Therefore, it may be a potential 
therapeutic target for gastric cancer.

Acquiring a telomere maintenance mechanism is a hallmark of high-risk 
neuroblastoma and commonly occurs by expressing telomerase (TERT). 
Telomerase-negative neuroblastoma has long telomeres and utilizes the 
telomerase-independent alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) mechanism. 
Conversely, no discernable telomere maintenance mechanism is detected in a 
fraction of neuroblastoma with long telomeres. Here, we show, unlike most 
cancers, DNA of the TERT promoter is broadly hypomethylated in neuroblastoma. In 
telomerase-positive neuroblastoma cells, the hypomethylated DNA promoter is 
approximately 1.5 kb. The TERT locus shows active chromatin marks with low 
enrichment for the repressive mark, H3K27me3. MYCN, a commonly amplified 
oncogene in neuroblstoma, binds to the promoter and induces TERT expression. 
Strikingly, in neuroblastoma with long telomeres, the hypomethylated region 
spans the entire TERT locus, including multiple nearby genes with enrichment for 
the repressive H3K27me3 chromatin mark. Furthermore, subtelomeric regions showed 
enrichment of repressive chromatin marks in neuroblastomas with long telomeres 
relative to those with short telomeres. These repressive marks were even more 
evident at the genic loci, suggesting a telomere position effect (TPE). 
Inhibiting H3K27 methylation by three different EZH2 inhibitors induced the 
expression of TERT in cell lines with long telomeres and H3K27me3 marks in the 
promoter region. EZH2 inhibition facilitated MYCN binding to the TERT promoter 
in neuroblastoma cells with long telomeres. Taken together, these data suggest 
that epigenetic regulation of TERT expression differs in neuroblastoma depending 
on the telomere maintenance status, and H3K27 methylation is important in 
repressing TERT expression in neuroblastoma with long telomeres.
SIGNIFICANCE: The epigenetic landscape of the TERT locus is unique in 
neuroblastoma. The DNA at the TERT locus, unlike other cancer cells and similar 
to normal cells, are hypomethylated in telomerase-positive neuroblastoma cells. 
The TERT locus is repressed by polycomb repressive complex-2 complex in 
neuroblastoma cells that have long telomeres and do not express TERT. Long 
telomeres in neuroblastoma cells are also associated with repressive chromatin 
states at the chromosomal termini, suggesting TPE.

The genomic landscape of esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC), as well as its 
impact on the regulation of immune microenvironment, is not well understood. 
Thus, tumor samples from 92 patients were collected from two centers and 
subjected to targeted-gene sequencing. We identified frequently mutated genes, 
including TP53, KMT2C, KMT2D, LRP1B, and FAT1. The most frequent mutation sites 
were ALOX12B (c.1565C > T), SLX4 (c.2786C > T), LRIG1 (c.746A > G), and SPEN 
(c.6915_6917del) (6.5%). Pathway analysis revealed dysregulation of cell cycle 
regulation, epigenetic regulation, PI3K/AKT signaling, and NOTCH signaling. A 
17-mutated gene-related risk model was constructed using random survival forest 
analysis and showed significant prognostic value in both our cohort and the 
validation cohort. Based on the Estimation of Stromal and Immune cells in 
Malignant Tumor tissues using Expression (ESTIMATE) algorithm, the Tumor Immune 
Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) algorithm, and the MCPcounter algorithm, we 
found that the risk score calculated by the risk model was significantly 
correlated with stimulatory immune checkpoints (TNFSF4, ITGB2, CXCL10, CXCL9, 
and BTN3A1; p < 0.05). Additionally, it was significantly associated with 
markers that are important in predicting response to immunotherapy (CD274, IFNG, 
and TAMM2; p < 0.05). Furthermore, the results of immunofluorescence double 
staining showed that patients with high risk scores had a significantly higher 
level of M2 macrophage than those with low risk scores (p < 0.05). In 
conclusion, our study provides insights into the genomic landscape of ESCC and 
highlights the prognostic value of a genomic mutation signature associated with 
the immune microenvironment in southern Chinese patients with ESCC.

BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer (PCa) is a malignant tumor of the male reproductive 
system, and its incidence has increased significantly in recent years. This 
study aimed to further identify candidate biomarkers with prognostic and 
diagnostic significance by integrating gene expression and DNA methylation data 
from PCa patients through association analysis.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: To this end, this paper proposes a sparse partial least 
squares regression algorithm based on hypergraph regularization (HR-SPLS) by 
integrating and clustering two kinds of data. Next, module 2, with the most 
significant weight, was selected for further analysis according to the weight of 
each module related to DNA methylation and mRNAs. Based on the DNA methylation 
sites in module 2, this paper uses multiple machine learning methods to 
construct a PCa diagnosis-related model of 10-DNA methylation sites.
RESULTS: The results of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis showed 
that the DNA methylation-related diagnostic model we constructed could diagnose 
PCa patients with high accuracy. Subsequently, based on the mRNAs in module 2, 
we constructed a prognostic model for 7-mRNAs (MYH11, ACTG2, DDR2, CDC42EP3, 
MARCKSL1, LMOD1, and MYLK) using multivariate Cox regression analysis. The 
prognostic model could predict the disease free survival of PCa patients with 
moderate to high accuracy (area under the curve (AUC) =0.761). In addition, Gene 
Set EnrichmentAnalysis (GSEA) and immune analysis indicated that the prognosis 
of patients in the risk group might be related to immune cell infiltration.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings may provide new methods and insights for identifying 
disease-related biomarkers by integrating DNA methylation and gene expression 
data.

BACKGROUND: Hypoxia remains a challenge for the therapeutic management of head 
and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The combination of radiotherapy with 
nimorazole has shown treatment benefit in HNSCC, but the precise underlying 
molecular mechanisms remain unclear.
PURPOSE: To assess and to characterize the transcriptomic/epigenetic landscape 
of HNSCC tumor models showing differential therapeutic response to fractionated 
radiochemotherapy (RCTx) combined with nimorazole.
MATERIALS/METHODS: Bulk RNA-sequencing and DNA methylation experiments were 
conducted using untreated and treated HNSCC xenografts after 10 fractions of 
RCTx with and without nimorazole. These tumor models (FaDu, SAS, Cal33, SAT and 
UT-SCC-45) previously showed a heterogeneous response to RCTx with nimorazole. 
The prognostic impact of candidate genes was assessed using clinical and gene 
expression data from HNSCC patients treated with primary RCTx within the 
DKTK-ROG.
RESULTS: Nimorazole responder and non-responder tumor models showed no 
differences in hypoxia gene signatures However, non-responder models showed 
upregulation of metabolic pathways. From that, a subset of 15 differentially 
expressed genes stratified HNSCC patients into low and high-risk groups with 
distinct outcome.
CONCLUSION: In the present study, we found that nimorazole non-responder models 
were characterized by upregulation of genes involved in Retinol metabolism and 
xenobiotic metabolic process pathways, which might contribute to identify 
mechanisms of resistance to nitroimidazole compounds and potentially expand the 
repertoire of therapeutic options to treat HNSCC.

Control of cellular identity requires coordination of developmental programs 
with environmental factors such as nutrient availability, suggesting that 
perturbing metabolism can alter cell state. Here, we find that nucleotide 
depletion and DNA replication stress drive differentiation in human and murine 
normal and transformed hematopoietic systems, including patient-derived acute 
myeloid leukemia (AML) xenografts. These cell state transitions begin during S 
phase and are independent of ATR/ATM checkpoint signaling, double-stranded DNA 
break formation, and changes in cell cycle length. In systems where 
differentiation is blocked by oncogenic transcription factor expression, 
replication stress activates primed regulatory loci and induces 
lineage-appropriate maturation genes despite the persistence of progenitor 
programs. Altering the baseline cell state by manipulating transcription factor 
expression causes replication stress to induce genes specific for alternative 
lineages. The ability of replication stress to selectively activate primed 
maturation programs across different contexts suggests a general mechanism by 
which changes in metabolism can promote lineage-appropriate cell state 
transitions.

Beckwith-Wiedemann spectrum (BWSp) is caused by genetic and epigenetic 
alterations on chromosome 11 that regulate cell growth and division. Considering 
the diverse phenotypic landscape in BWSp, the characterization of the CDKN1C 
molecular subtype remains relatively limited. Here, we investigate the role of 
CDKN1C in the broader BWSp phenotype. Notably, patients with CDKN1C variants 
appear to exhibit a different tumor risk than other BWSp molecular subtypes. We 
performed a comprehensive literature review using the search term ""CDKN1C 
Beckwith"" to identify 113 cases of patients with molecularly confirmed 
CDKN1C-BWSp. We then assessed the genotype and phenotype in a novel cohort of 
patients with CDKN1C-BWSp enrolled in the BWS Research Registry. Cardinal and 
suggestive features were evaluated for all patients reported, and tumor risk was 
established based on available reports. The most common phenotypes included 
macroglossia, omphalocele, and ear creases/pits. Tumor types reported from the 
literature included neuroblastoma, acute lymphocytic leukemia, superficial 
spreading melanoma, and intratubular germ cell neoplasia. Overall, this study 
identifies unique features associated with CDKN1C variants in BWSp, enabling 
more accurate clinical management. The absence of Wilms tumor and hepatoblastoma 
suggests that screening for these tumors may not be necessary, while the 
neuroblastoma risk warrants appropriate screening recommendations.

Since 2017, a self-sampling device has been introduced to the Dutch 
population-based screening program to enable higher participation rates. 
However, routine triage cytology cannot be performed on self-sampling material. 
Methylation is an alternative triage method that can be performed directly on 
DNA extracted from self-samples. Recently, we tested a set of 15 published 
cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 or worse (CIN3+)-specific methylation 
markers and found a panel of 3 markers with a sensitivity of 82% and a 
specificity of 74%. In this study, we determined the sensitivity and specificity 
of 2 commercial assays using quantitative methylation-specific PCR. DNA from the 
same cohort of high-risk human papillomavirus-positive self-sampled material 
obtained through the population-based screening program in the North of the 
Netherlands from women with CIN2 or less (<CIN3, n = 208) and women with CIN3+ 
(n = 96) was used. The QIAsure methylation test (consisting of 2 methylation 
markers) showed a sensitivity of 65% and a specificity of 72%, whereas the 
Gyntect assay (consisting of 6 methylation markers) showed a sensitivity of 59% 
and a specificity of 91% for CIN3+. When we compared all individual 23 
methylation markers, receiver operating characteristic analysis showed an area 
under the curve of ≥0.7 for 11 of 23 markers (P < .001). By model-based 
recursive partitioning and robustness analysis, we found a panel with a better 
sensitivity compared with QIAsure and Gyntect (P < .001). This new panel, 
consisting of ITGA4, ASCL1, and FAM19A4, has a sensitivity of 84% and a 
specificity of 70%, similar to our previously identified panel (ANKRD18CP, LHX8, 
and EPB41L3). Thus, in addition to our previously identified panel, the 
combination of ITGA4, ASCL1, and FAM19A4 showed good diagnostic performance and 
potentially can replace cytology, thereby avoiding additional doctor visits for 
many women worldwide and reducing the time for decision making for referral to 
the gynecologist.

In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the impact of 
extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) on 
colorectal cancer (CRC) development. The focus was on the role of MAGI2-AS3, 
delivered by BMSC-EVs, in regulating USP6NL DNA methylation-mediated MYC protein 
translation modification to promote CDK2 downregulation. Utilizing 
bioinformatics analysis, we identified significant enrichment of MAGI2-AS3 
related to copper-induced cell death in CRC. In vitro experiments demonstrated 
the downregulation of MAGI2-AS3 in CRC cells, and BMSC-EVs were found to deliver 
MAGI2-AS3 to inhibit CRC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Further 
exploration revealed that MAGI2-AS3 suppressed MYC protein translation 
modification by regulating USP6NL DNA methylation, leading to CDK2 
downregulation and prevention of colorectal cancer. Overexpression of MYC 
reversed the functional effects of BMSC-EVs-MAGI2-AS3. In vivo experiments 
validated the inhibitory impact of BMSC-EVs-MAGI2-AS3 on CRC tumorigenicity by 
promoting CDK2 downregulation through USP6NL DNA methylation-mediated MYC 
protein translation modification. Overall, BMSC-EVs-MAGI2-AS3 may serve as a 
potential intervention to prevent CRC occurrence by modulating key molecular 
pathways.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most aggressive 
malignancies, with a notoriously dismal prognosis. As a competitive inhibitor of 
DNA synthesis, gemcitabine is the cornerstone drug for treating PDAC at all 
stages. The therapeutic effect of gemcitabine, however, is often hindered by 
drug resistance, and the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. It is 
unclear whether their response to chemotherapeutics is regulated by endocrine 
regulators, despite the association between PDAC risk and endocrine 
deregulation. Here, we show that prolactin receptor (PRLR) synergizes with 
gemcitabine in both in vitro and in vivo treatment of PDAC. Interestingly, PRLR 
promotes the expression of miR-4763-3p and miR-3663-5p, two novel miRNAs whose 
functions are unknown. Furthermore, the analysis of transcriptome sequencing 
data of tumors from lactating mouse models enriches the PPP pathway, a 
multifunctional metabolic pathway. In addition to providing energy, the PPP 
pathway mainly provides a variety of raw materials for anabolism. We demonstrate 
that two key enzymes of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), G6PD and TKT, are 
directly targeted by miR-4763-3p and miR-3663-5p. Notably, miR-4763-3p and 
miR-3663-5p diminish the nucleotide synthesis of the PPP pathway, thereby 
increasing gemcitabine sensitivity. As a result, PRLR harnesses these two miRNAs 
to suppress PPP and nucleotide synthesis, subsequently elevating the gemcitabine 
sensitivity of PDAC cells. Also, PDAC tissues and tumors from LSL-KrasG12D/+, 
LSL-Trp53R172H/+, and PDX1-cre (KPC) mice exhibit downregulation of PRLR. 
Bisulfite sequencing of PDAC tissues revealed that PRLR downregulation is due to 
epigenetic methylation. In this study, we show for the first time that the 
endocrine receptor PRLR improves the effects of gemcitabine by boosting two new 
miRNAs that block the PPP pathway and nucleotide synthesis by inhibiting two 
essential enzymes concurrently. The PRLR-miRNAs-PPP axis may serve as a possible 
therapeutic target to supplement chemotherapy advantages in PDAC.

BACKGROUND: Gut microbiota is an important factor affecting host health. With 
the further study of the mechanism of gut microbiota, significant progress has 
been made in the study of the link between gut microbiota and epigenetics. This 
study visualizes the body of knowledge and research priorities between the gut 
microbiota and epigenetics through bibliometrics.
METHODS: Publications related to gut microbiota and epigenetics were searched in 
the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database. Vosviewer 1.6.17 and 
CiteSpace 6.1.R2 were used for bibliometric analysis.
RESULTS: WoSCC includes 460 articles from 71 countries. The number of 
publications on gut microbiota and epigenetics has increased each year since 
2011. The USA, PEOPLES R CHINA, and ITALY are at the center of this field of 
research. The University of California System, Harvard University, and the 
University of London are the main research institutions. Li, X, Yu, Q, Zhang, S 
X are the top authors in this research field. We found that current research 
hotspots and frontiers include short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) play an important 
role in gut microbiota and epigenetic mechanisms, gut microbiota and epigenetics 
play an important role in host obesity, diet, and metabolism. Gut microbiota and 
epigenetics are closely related to colorectal cancer, breast cancer, and 
inflammatory bowel disease. At the same time, we found that gut microbiota 
regulates epigenetics through the gut-brain axis and has an impact on 
psychiatric diseases. Therefore, probiotics can regulate gut microbiota, improve 
lifestyle, and reduce the occurrence and development of diseases.
CONCLUSION: This is the first comprehensive and in-depth bibliometric study of 
trends and developments in the field of gut microbiota and epigenetics research. 
This study helps to guide the direction of research scholars in their current 
field of study.

Estrogen receptor-negative [ER(-)] mammary cancer is the most aggressive type of 
breast cancer (BC) with higher rate of metastasis and recurrence. In recent 
years, dietary prevention of BC with epigenetically active phytochemicals has 
received increased attention due to its feasibility, effectiveness, and ease of 
implementation. In this regard, combinatorial phytochemical intervention enables 
more efficacious BC inhibition by simultaneously targeting multiple tumorigenic 
pathways. We, therefore, focused on investigation of the effect of sulforaphane 
(SFN)-rich broccoli sprouts (BSp) and withaferin A (WA)-rich Ashwagandha (Ash) 
combination on BC prevention in estrogen receptor-negative [ER(-)] mammary 
cancer using transgenic mice. Our results indicated that combinatorial BSp + Ash 
treatment significantly reduced tumor incidence and tumor growth (~ 75%) as well 
as delayed (~ 21%) tumor latency when compared to the control treatment and 
combinatorial BSp + Ash treatment was statistically more effective in 
suppressing BC compared to single BSp or Ash intervention. At the molecular 
level, the BSp and Ash combination upregulated tumor suppressors (p53, p57) 
along with apoptosis associated proteins (BAX, PUMA) and BAX:BCL-2 ratio. 
Furthermore, our result indicated an expressional decline of epigenetic 
machinery HDAC1 and DNMT3A in mammary tumor tissue because of combinatorial 
treatment. Interestingly, we have reported multiple synergistic interactions 
between BSp and Ash that have impacted both tumor phenotype and molecular 
expression due to combinatorial BSp and Ash treatment. Our RNA-seq analysis 
results also demonstrated a transcriptome-wide expressional reshuffling of genes 
associated with multiple cell-signaling pathways, transcription factor activity 
and epigenetic regulations due to combined BSp and Ash administration. In 
addition, we discovered an alteration of gut microbial composition change 
because of combinatorial treatment. Overall, combinatorial BSp and Ash 
supplementation can prevent ER(-) BC through enhanced tumor suppression, 
apoptosis induction and transcriptome-wide reshuffling of gene expression 
possibly influencing multiple cell signaling pathways, epigenetic regulation and 
reshaping gut microbiota.

The discovery of RNA methylation alterations associated with cancer holds 
promise for their utilization as potential biomarkers in cancer diagnosis, 
prognosis, and prediction. RNA methylation has been found to impact the 
immunological microenvironment of tumors, but the specific role of 
methylation-related genes (MRGs), particularly in breast cancer (BC), the most 
common cancer among women globally, within the tumor microenvironment remains 
unknown. In this study, we obtained data from TCGA and GEO databases to 
investigate the expression patterns of MRGs in both genomic and transcriptional 
domains in BC. By analyzing the data, we identified two distinct genetic 
groupings that were correlated with clinicopathological characteristics, 
prognosis, degree of TME cell infiltration, and other abnormalities in MRGs 
among patients. Subsequently, an MRG model was developed to predict overall 
survival (OS) and its accuracy was evaluated in BC patients. Additionally, a 
highly precise nomogram was created to enhance the practical usability of the 
MRG model. In low-risk groups, we observed lower TBM values and higher TIDE 
scores. We further explored how MRGs influence a patient's prognosis, clinically 
significant characteristics, response to therapy, and the TME. These risk 
signatures have the potential to improve treatment strategies for BC patients 
and could be applied in future clinical settings. Moreover, they may also be 
utilized to determine prognosis and biological features in these patients.

Spermatocytic tumors are rare testicular tumors occurring predominantly in older 
men. Most show a classical tripartite morphology (different from seminoma) and 
are benign. However, well-documented cases of malignant spermatocytic tumors 
exist. Our previous work showed that a subset of spermatocytic tumors exhibiting 
TP53 mutations, DNA methylation profiles closer to seminomas, and/or gains in 
chromosome 12p exhibited aggressive characteristics, including sarcomatoid 
transformation and metastatic dissemination. The microRNA-371-373 cluster is a 
promising biomarker which is upregulated in non-teratoma germ cell tumors with 
malignant behavior. In this work we analyze microRNAs-371-373 b y quantitative 
real-time polymerase chain reaction in 18 spermatocytic tumors representative of 
the whole clinical spectrum, including 6 with aggressive features (sarcomatoid 
transformation, metastases, or gains in chromosome 12p). The levels of 
microRNAs-371-373 were significantly higher in non-teratoma germ cell tumors 
compared to spermatocytic tumors, overall (p < 0.0001). Importantly, levels of 
microRNA-371-373 were higher in spermatocytic tumors with aggressive features 
compared to non-aggressive neoplasms. The highest levels were observed in one 
tumor showing isochromosome 12p. These results further support our previous 
findings that a subset of spermatocytic tumors are intermediate between 
so-called type II and type III germ cell tumors and that embryonic microRNAs 
play a role in aggressive behavior in spermatocytic tumors. Accordingly, this 
subset of tumors may behave aggressively and require close follow up. In the 
future, this opens an opportunity for microRNA testing in serum of spermatocytic 
tumor patients for risk stratification purposes.

BACKGROUND: Aberrant DNA methylation has been identified as biomarkers for 
breast cancer detection. Coiled-coil domain containing 12 gene (CCDC12) 
implicated in tumorigenesis. This study aims to investigate the potential of 
blood-based CCDC12 methylation for breast cancer detection.
METHODS: DNA methylation level of CpG sites (Cytosine-phosphate Guanine 
dinucleotides) in CCDC12 gene was measured by mass spectrometry in 255 breast 
cancer patients, 155 patients with benign breast nodules and 302 healthy 
controls. The association between CCDC12 methylation and breast cancer risk was 
evaluated by logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic curve 
analysis.
RESULTS: A total of eleven CpG sites were analyzed. The CCDC12 methylation 
levels were higher in breast cancer patients. Compared to the lowest tertile of 
methylation level in CpG_6,7, CpG_10 and CpG_11, the highest quartile was 
associated with 82, 91 and 95% increased breast cancer risk, respectively. The 
CCDC12 methylation levels were associated with estrogen receptor (ER) and human 
epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) status. In ER-negative and HER2-positive 
(ER-/HER2+) breast cancer subtype, the combination of four sites CpG_2, CpG_5, 
CpG_6,7 and CpG_11 methylation levels could distinguish ER-/HER2+ breast cancer 
from the controls (AUC = 0.727).
CONCLUSION: The hypermethylation levels of CCDC12 in peripheral blood could be 
used for breast cancer detection.

Plain Language Summary: Breast cancer detection could be facilitated by novel 
blood-based DNA methylation biomarkers.The methylation levels of CpG sites in 
CCDC12 were higher in breast cancer than those in controls.The combination of 
four sites CpG_2, CpG_5, CpG_6,7 and CpG_11 methylation levels could distinguish 
ER-/HER2+ breast cancer subtype from the controls.

Vitamin B12 plays a role in DNA methylation, influencing the 1-carbon cycle; 
However, its effect on colorectal cancer (CRC) mortality remains uncertain. This 
study assessed the relationship between vitamin B12 intake and all-cause and 
cancer-specific mortality among CRC patients. We analyzed data from the NHANES 
from 1999 to 2018, using multivariable Cox regression, competing risk model, 
Kaplan-Meier survival curves, and stratified analysis with interaction effects. 
The studied involved 4,554 cancer patients (mean age 65.8 years, 47.6% males). 
Results from multivariate Cox regression indicated that each additional 
1 mcg/day of dietary vitamin B12 independently increased the risk of all-cause 
(HR, 1.07; 95% CI: 1.04-1.09, p < 0.001) and cancer-specific mortality (HR, 
1.04; 95% CI, 1.02-1.06; p < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier curves indicated a higher risk 
of all-cause mortality with increased vitamin B12 intake (Log rank p = 0.01). 
Subgroup analysis suggested that higher vitamin B12 intake correlated with 
increased all-cause mortality risk, especially in individuals with higher 
protein (HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.02-1.06; p = 0.019) or carbohydrate intake (HR, 
1.03; 95% CI, 1.01-1.05; p = 0.04). Thus, higher vitamin B12 intake correlates 
with increased all-cause and cancer-specific mortality in CRC patients, 
particularly those with higher protein or carbohydrate intake.

Emerging evidence has revealed the novel role of gut microbiota in the 
development of cancer. The characteristics of function and composition in the 
gut microbiota of patients with breast cancer patients has been reported, 
however the detailed causation between gut microbiota and breast cancer remains 
uncertain. In the present study, 16S rRNA sequencing revealed that Prevotella, 
particularly the dominant species Prevotella copri, is significantly enriched 
and prevalent in gut microbiota of breast cancer patients. Prior-oral 
administration of P. copri could promote breast cancer growth in specific 
pathogen-free mice and germ-free mice, accompanied with sharp reduction of 
indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPyA). Mechanistically, the present of excessive P. copri 
consumed a large amount of tryptophan (Trp), thus hampering the physiological 
accumulation of IPyA in the host. Our results revealed that IPyA is an intrinsic 
anti-cancer reagent in the host at physiological level. Briefly, IPyA directly 
suppressed the transcription of UHRF1, following by the declined UHRF1 and PP2A 
C in nucleus, thus inhibiting the phosphorylation of AMPK, which is just 
opposite to the cancer promoting effect of P. copri. Therefore, the exhaustion 
of IPyA by excessive P. copri strengthens the UHRF1-mediated negative control to 
inactivated the energy-controlling AMPK signaling pathway to promote tumor 
growth, which was indicated by the alternation in pattern of protein expression 
and DNA methylation. Our findings, for the first time, highlighted P. copri as a 
risk factor for the progression of breast cancer.

BACKGROUND: Large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) is the most common lymphoma and is 
known to be a biologically heterogeneous disease regarding genetic, phenotypic, 
and clinical features. Although the prognosis is good, one-third has a primary 
refractory or relapsing disease which underscores the importance of developing 
predictive biological markers capable of identifying high- and low-risk 
patients. DNA methylation (DNAm) and telomere maintenance alterations are 
hallmarks of cancer and aging. Both these alterations may contribute to the 
heterogeneity of the disease, and potentially influence the prognosis of LBCL.
RESULTS: We studied the DNAm profiles (Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip) and 
relative telomere lengths (RTL) with qPCR of 93 LBCL cases: Diffuse large B-cell 
lymphoma not otherwise specified (DLBCL, n = 66), High-grade B-cell lymphoma 
(n = 7), Primary CNS lymphoma (n = 8), and transformation of indolent B-cell 
lymphoma (n = 12). There was a substantial methylation heterogeneity in DLBCL 
and other LBCL entities compared to normal cells and other B-cell neoplasms. 
LBCL cases had a particularly aberrant semimethylated pattern (0.15 ≤ β ≤ 0.8) 
with large intertumor variation and overall low hypermethylation (β > 0.8). DNAm 
patterns could not be used to distinguish between germinal center B-cell-like 
(GC) and non-GC DLBCL cases. In cases treated with R-CHOP-like regimens, a high 
percentage of global hypomethylation (β < 0.15) was in multivariable analysis 
associated with worse disease-specific survival (DSS) (HR 6.920, 95% 
CI 1.499-31.943) and progression-free survival (PFS) (HR 4.923, 95% 
CI 1.286-18.849) in DLBCL and with worse DSS (HR 5.147, 95% CI 1.239-21.388) in 
LBCL. These cases with a high percentage of global hypomethylation also had a 
higher degree of CpG island methylation, including islands in 
promoter-associated regions, than the cases with less hypomethylation. 
Additionally, telomere length was heterogenous in LBCL, with a subset of the 
DLBCL-GC cases accounting for the longest RTL. Short RTL was independently 
associated with worse DSS (HR 6.011, 95% CI 1.319-27.397) and PFS (HR 4.689, 95% 
CI 1.102-19.963) in LBCL treated with R-CHOP-like regimens.
CONCLUSION: We hypothesize that subclones with high global hypomethylation and 
hypermethylated CpG islands could have advantages in tumor progression, e.g. by 
inactivating tumor suppressor genes or promoting treatment resistance. Our 
findings suggest that cases with high global hypomethylation and thus poor 
prognosis could be candidates for alternative treatment regimens including 
hypomethylating drugs.

BACKGROUND: Risk of recurrence and progression of ductal carcinoma in situ 
(DCIS) to invasive cancer remains uncertain, emphasizing the need for developing 
predictive biomarkers of aggressive DCIS.
METHODS: Human cell lines and mouse models of disease progression were analyzed 
for candidate risk predictive biomarkers identified and validated in two 
independent DCIS cohorts.
RESULTS: RNA profiling of normal mammary and DCIS tissues (n = 48) revealed that 
elevated SOX11 expression correlates with MKI67, EZH2, and DCIS recurrence 
score. The 21T human cell line model of DCIS progression to invasive cancer and 
two mouse models developing mammary intraepithelial neoplasia confirmed the 
findings. AKT activation correlated with chromatin accessibility and EZH2 
enrichment upregulating SOX11 expression. AKT and HER2 inhibitors decreased 
SOX11 expression along with diminished mammosphere formation. SOX11 was 
upregulated in HER2+ and basal-like subtypes (P < 0.001). Longitudinal DCIS 
cohort (n = 194) revealed shorter recurrence-free survival in SOX11+ than SOX11- 
patients (P = 0.0056 in all DCIS; P < 0.0001 in HER2+ subtype) associated with 
increased risk of ipsilateral breast event/IBE (HR = 1.9, 95%CI = 1.2-2.9; 
P = 0.003).
DISCUSSION: Epigenetic activation of SOX11 drives recurrence of DCIS and 
progression to invasive cancer, suggesting SOX11 as a predictive biomarker of 
IBE.

The cumulative number of stem cell divisions in a tissue, known as mitotic age, 
is thought to be a major determinant of cancer-risk. Somatic mutational and DNA 
methylation (DNAm) clocks are promising tools to molecularly track mitotic age, 
yet their relationship is underexplored and their potential for cancer risk 
prediction in normal tissues remains to be demonstrated. Here we build and 
validate an improved pan-tissue DNAm counter of total mitotic age called 
stemTOC. We demonstrate that stemTOC's mitotic age proxy increases with the 
tumor cell-of-origin fraction in each of 15 cancer-types, in precancerous 
lesions, and in normal tissues exposed to major cancer risk factors. Extensive 
benchmarking against 6 other mitotic counters shows that stemTOC compares 
favorably, specially in the preinvasive and normal-tissue contexts. By 
cross-correlating stemTOC to two clock-like somatic mutational signatures, we 
confirm the mitotic-like nature of only one of these. Our data points towards 
DNAm as a promising molecular substrate for detecting mitotic-age increases in 
normal tissues and precancerous lesions, and hence for developing cancer-risk 
prediction strategies.

Somatic changes like copy number aberrations (CNAs) and epigenetic alterations 
like methylation have pivotal effects on disease outcomes and prognosis in 
cancer, by regulating gene expressions, that drive critical biological 
processes. To identify potential biomarkers and molecular targets and understand 
how they impact disease outcomes, it is important to identify key groups of 
CNAs, the associated methylation, and the gene expressions they impact, through 
a joint integrative analysis. Here, we propose a novel analysis pipeline, the 
joint sparse canonical correlation analysis (jsCCA), an extension of sCCA, to 
effectively identify an ensemble of CNAs, methylation sites and gene 
(expression) components in the context of disease endpoints, especially tumor 
characteristics. Our approach detects potentially orthogonal gene components 
that are highly correlated with sets of methylation sites which in turn are 
correlated with sets of CNA sites. It then identifies the genes within these 
components that are associated with the outcome. Further, we aggregate the 
effect of each gene expression set on tumor stage by constructing ""gene 
component scores"" and test its interaction with traditional risk factors. 
Analyzing clinical and genomic data on 515 renal clear cell carcinoma (ccRCC) 
patients from the TCGA-KIRC, we found eight gene components to be associated 
with methylation sites, regulated by groups of proximally located CNA sites. 
Association analysis with tumor stage at diagnosis identified a novel 
association of expression of ASAH1 gene trans-regulated by methylation of 
several genes including SIX5 and by CNAs in the 10q25 region including TCF7L2. 
Further analysis to quantify the overall effect of gene sets on tumor stage, 
revealed that two of the eight gene components have significant interaction with 
smoking in relation to tumor stage. These gene components represent distinct 
biological functions including immune function, inflammatory responses, and 
hypoxia-regulated pathways. Our findings suggest that jsCCA analysis can 
identify interpretable and important genes, regulatory structures, and 
clinically consequential pathways. Such methods are warranted for comprehensive 
analysis of multimodal data especially in cancer genomics.

BACKGROUND: Early diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) can significantly 
improve patient survival. We aimed to develop a blood-based assay to aid in the 
diagnosis, detection and prognostic evaluation of HCC.
METHODS: A three-phase multicentre study was conducted to screen, optimise and 
validate HCC-specific differentially methylated regions (DMRs) using 
next-generation sequencing and quantitative methylation-specific PCR (qMSP).
RESULTS: Genome-wide methylation profiling was conducted to identify DMRs 
distinguishing HCC tumours from peritumoural tissues and healthy plasmas. The 
twenty most effective DMRs were verified and incorporated into a multilocus qMSP 
assay (HepaAiQ). The HepaAiQ model was trained to separate 293 HCC patients 
(Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage 0/A, 224) from 266 controls 
including chronic hepatitis B (CHB) or liver cirrhosis (LC) (CHB/LC, 96), benign 
hepatic lesions (BHL, 23), and healthy controls (HC, 147). The model achieved an 
area under the curve (AUC) of 0.944 with a sensitivity of 86.0% in HCC and a 
specificity of 92.1% in controls. Blind validation of the HepaAiQ model in a 
cohort of 523 participants resulted in an AUC of 0.940 with a sensitivity of 
84.4% in 205 HCC cases (BCLC stage 0/A, 167) and a specificity of 90.3% in 318 
controls (CHB/LC, 100; BHL, 102; HC, 116). When evaluated in an independent test 
set, the HepaAiQ model exhibited a sensitivity of 70.8% in 65 HCC patients at 
BCLC stage 0/A and a specificity of 89.5% in 124 patients with CHB/LC. Moreover, 
HepaAiQ model was assessed in paired pre- and postoperative plasma samples from 
103 HCC patients and correlated with 2-year patient outcomes. Patients with high 
postoperative HepaAiQ score showed a higher recurrence risk (Hazard ratio, 3.33, 
p < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: HepaAiQ, a noninvasive qMSP assay, was developed to accurately 
measure HCC-specific DMRs and shows great potential for the diagnosis, detection 
and prognosis of HCC, benefiting at-risk populations.

Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most prevalent gynaecological cancer in 
high-income countries and its incidence is continuing to rise sharply. Simple 
and objective tools to reliably detect women with EC are urgently needed. We 
recently developed and validated the DNA methylation (DNAme)-based women's 
cancer risk identification-quantitative polymerase chain reaction test for 
endometrial cancer (WID-qEC) test that could address this need. Here, we 
demonstrate that the stability of the WID-qEC test remains consistent regardless 
of: (i) the cervicovaginal collection device and sample media used (Cervex brush 
and PreservCyt or FLOQSwab and eNAT), (ii) the collector of the specimen 
(gynaecologist- or patient-based), and (iii) the precise sampling site 
(cervical, cervicovaginal and vaginal). Furthermore, we demonstrate sample 
stability in eNAT medium for 7 days at room temperature, greatly facilitating 
the implementation of the test into diagnostic laboratory workflows. When 
applying FLOQSwabs (Copan) in combination with the eNAT (Copan) sample 
collection media, the sensitivity and specificity of the WID-qEC test to detect 
uterine (i.e., endometrial and cervical) cancers in gynaecologist-taken samples 
was 92.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 75.0%-98.8%) and 98.6% (95% 
CI = 91.7%-99.9%), respectively, whilst the sensitivity and specificity in 
patient collected self-samples was 75.0% (95% CI = 47.4%-91.7%) and 100.0% (95% 
CI = 93.9%-100.0%), respectively. Taken together these data confirm the 
robustness and clinical potential of the WID-qEC test.

This study investigates the association between epigenetic age acceleration 
(EAA) derived from DNA methylation and the risk of incident colorectal cancer 
(CRC). We utilized data from a random population sample of 9,360 individuals 
(men and women, aged 45-69) from the HAPIEE Study who had been followed up for 
16 years. A nested case-control design yielded 35 incident CRC cases and 354 
matched controls. Six baseline epigenetic age (EA) measures (Horvath, Hannum, 
PhenoAge, Skin and Blood (SB), BLUP, and Elastic Net (EN)) were calculated along 
with their respective EAAs. After adjustment, the odds ratios (ORs) for CRC risk 
per decile increase in EAA ranged from 1.20 (95% CI: 1.04-1.39) to 1.44 (95% CI: 
1.21-1.76) for the Horvath, Hannum, PhenoAge, and BLUP measures. Conversely, the 
SB and EN EAA measures showed borderline inverse associations with ORs of 
0.86-0.87 (95% CI: 0.76-0.99). Tertile analysis reinforced a positive 
association between CRC risk and four EAA measures (Horvath, Hannum, PhenoAge, 
and BLUP) and a modest inverse relationship with EN EAA. Our findings from a 
prospective population-based-case-control study indicate a direct association 
between incident CRC and four markers of accelerated baseline epigenetic age. In 
contrast, two markers showed a negative association or no association. These 
results warrant further exploration in larger cohorts and may have implications 
for CRC risk assessment and prevention.

Myelodysplastic syndrome/neoplasm (MDS) comprises a group of heterogeneous 
hematopoietic disorders that present with genetic mutations and/or cytogenetic 
changes and, in the advanced stage, exhibit wide-ranging gene hypermethylation. 
Patients with higher-risk MDS are typically treated with repeated cycles of 
hypomethylating agents, such as azacitidine. However, some patients fail to 
respond to this therapy, and fewer than 50% show hematologic improvement. In 
this context, we focused on the potential use of epigenetic data in clinical 
management to aid in diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making. First, we used 
the F-36P MDS cell line to establish an azacitidine-resistant F-36P cell line. 
We performed expression profiling of azacitidine-resistant and parental F-36P 
cells and used biological and bioinformatics approaches to analyze candidate 
azacitidine-resistance-related genes and pathways. Eighty candidate genes were 
identified and found to encode proteins previously linked to cancer, chronic 
myeloid leukemia, and transcriptional misregulation in cancer. Interestingly, 24 
of the candidate genes had promoter methylation patterns that were inversely 
correlated with azacitidine resistance, suggesting that DNA methylation status 
may contribute to azacitidine resistance. In particular, the DNA methylation 
status and/or mRNA expression levels of the four genes (AMER1, HSPA2, NCX1, and 
TNFRSF10C) may contribute to the clinical effects of azacitidine in MDS. Our 
study provides information on azacitidine resistance diagnostic genes in MDS 
patients, which can be of great help in monitoring the effectiveness of 
treatment in progressing azacitidine treatment for newly diagnosed MDS patients.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is prone to metastasis and recurrence after surgery, 
which is one of the main causes for its poor treatment and prognosis. Therefore, 
it is essential to identify biomarkers associated with metastasis and recurrence 
in CRC. DNA methylation has a regulatory role in cancer metastasis, tumor immune 
microenvironment (TME), and prognosis and may be one of the most valuable 
biomarkers for predicting CRC metastasis and prognosis. We constructed a 
diagnostic model and nomogram that can effectively predict CRC metastasis based 
on the differential methylation CpG sites (DMCs) between metastatic and 
non-metastatic CRC patients. Then, we identified 17 DMCs associated with 
progression free survival (PFS) of CRC and constructed a prognostic model. The 
prognosis model based on 17 DMCs can predict the PFS of CRC with medium to high 
accuracy. The results of immunohistochemical analysis indicated that the protein 
expression levels of the genes involved in prognostic DMCs were different 
between normal and colorectal cancer tissues. According to the results of 
immune-related analysis, we found that the low-risk patients had better 
immunotherapy response. In addition, high risk scores were negatively correlated 
with high tumor mutation burden (TMB) levels, and patients with low TMB levels 
in the high-risk group had the worst PFS. Our work shows the clinical value of 
DNA methylation in predicting CRC metastasis and PFS, as well as their 
correlation with TME, immunotherapy, and TMB, which helps understand the changes 
of DNA methylation in CRC metastasis and improving the treatment and prognosis 
of CRC.

RNA editing, as an epigenetic mechanism, exhibits a strong correlation with the 
occurrence and development of cancers. Nevertheless, few studies have been 
conducted to investigate the impact of RNA editing on cervical squamous cell 
carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma (CESC). In order to study the 
connection between RNA editing and CESC patients' prognoses, we obtained 
CESC-related information from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and 
randomly allocated the patients into the training group or testing group. An RNA 
editing-based risk model for CESC patients was established by Cox regression 
analysis and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). According 
to the median score generated by this RNA editing-based risk model, patients 
were categorized into subgroups with high and low risks. We further constructed 
the nomogram by risk scores and clinical characteristics and analyzed the impact 
of RNA editing levels on host gene expression levels and adenosine deaminase 
acting on RNA. Finally, we also compared the biological functions and pathways 
of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between different subgroups by 
enrichment analysis. In this risk model, we screened out 6 RNA editing sites 
with significant prognostic value. The constructed nomogram performed well in 
forecasting patients' prognoses. Furthermore, the level of RNA editing at the 
prognostic site exhibited a strong correlation with host gene expression. In the 
high-risk subgroup, we observed multiple biological functions and pathways 
associated with immune response, cell proliferation, and tumor progression. This 
study establishes an RNA editing-based risk model that helps forecast patients' 
prognoses and offers a new understanding of the underlying mechanism of RNA 
editing in CESC.

While epigenomic alterations are common in colorectal cancers (CRC), few 
epigenomic biomarkers that risk-stratify patients have been identified. We thus 
sought to determine the potential of ZNF331 promoter hypermethylation (mZNF331) 
as a prognostic and predictive marker in colon cancer. We examined the 
association of mZNF331 with clinicopathologic features, relapse, survival, and 
treatment efficacy in patients with stage III colon cancer treated within a 
randomized adjuvant chemotherapy trial (CALGB/Alliance89803). Residual tumour 
tissue was available for genomic DNA extraction and methylation analysis for 385 
patients. ZNF331 promoter methylation status was determined by bisulphite 
conversion and fluorescence-based real-time polymerase chain reaction. 
Kaplan-Meier estimator and Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess 
the prognostic and predictive role of mZNF331 in this well-annotated dataset, 
adjusting for clinicopathologic features and standard molecular markers. mZNF331 
was observed in 267/385 (69.4%) evaluable cases. Histopathologic features were 
largely similar between patients with mZNF331 compared to unmethylated ZNF331 
(unmZNFF31). There was no significant difference in disease-free or overall 
survival between patients with mZNF331 versus unmZNF331 colon cancers, even when 
adjusting for clinicopathologic features and molecular marker status. Similarly, 
there was no difference in disease-free or overall survival across treatment 
arms when stratified by ZNF331 methylation status. While ZNF331 promoter 
hypermethylation is frequently observed in CRC, our current study of a small 
subset of patients with stage III colon cancer suggests limited applicability as 
a prognostic marker. Larger studies may provide more insight and clarity into 
the applicability of mZNF331 as a prognostic and predictive marker.

Inflammatory age (iAge) is a vital concept for understanding the intricate 
interplay between chronic inflammation and aging in the context of cancer. 
However, the importance of iAge-clock-related genes (iAge-CRGs) across cancers 
remains unexplored. This study aimed to explore the mechanisms and applications 
of these genes across diverse cancer types. We analyzed profiling data from over 
10,000 individuals, covering 33 cancer types, 750 small molecule drugs, and 24 
immune cell types. We focused on DCBLD2's function at the single-cell level and 
computed an iAge-CRG score using GSVA. This score was correlated with cancer 
pathways, immune infiltration, and survival. A signature was then derived using 
univariate Cox and LASSO regression, followed by ROC curve analysis, nomogram 
construction, decision curve analysis, and immunocytochemistry. Our 
comprehensive analysis revealed epigenetic, genomic, and immunogenomic 
alterations in iAge-CRGs, especially DCBLD2, leading to abnormal expression. 
Aberrant DCBLD2 expression strongly correlated with cancer-associated fibroblast 
infiltration and prognosis in multiple cancers. Based on GSVA results, we 
developed a risk model using five iAge-CRGs, which proved to be an independent 
prognostic index for uveal melanoma (UVM) patients. We also systematically 
evaluated the correlation between the iAge-related signature risk score and 
immune cell infiltration. iAge-CRGs, particularly DCBLD2, emerge as potential 
targets for enhancing immunotherapy outcomes. The strong correlation between 
abnormal DCBLD2 expression, cancer-associated fibroblast infiltration, and 
patient survival across various cancers underscores their significance. Our 
five-gene risk signature offers an independent prognostic tool for UVM patients, 
highlighting the crucial role of these genes in suppressing the immune response 
in UVM.Kindly check and confirm whether the corresponding affiliation is

BACKGROUND: Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) has been a leading cause of 
cancer-related mortality worldwide. Early intervention can significantly improve 
prognosis. DNA methylation could occur in the early stage of tumor. 
Comprehensive understanding the epigenetic landscape of early-stage LUAD is 
crucial in understanding tumorigenesis.
METHODS: Enzymatic methyl sequencing (EM-seq) was performed on 23 tumors and 
paired normal tissue to reveal distinct epigenetic landscape, for compared with 
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) 450K methylation microarray data. Then, an 
integrative analysis was performed combined with TCGA LUAD RNA-seq data to 
identify significant differential methylated and expressed genes. Subsequently, 
the prognostic risk model was constructed and cellular composition was analyzed.
RESULTS: Methylome analysis of EM-seq comparing tumor and normal tissues 
identified 25 million cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites and 30,187 
differentially methylated regions (DMR) with a greater number of untraditional 
types. EM-seq identified a significantly higher number of CpG sites and DMRs 
compared to the 450K microarray. By integrating the differentially methylated 
genes (DMGs) with LUAD-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from the 
TCGA database, we constructed prognostic model based on six differentially 
methylated-expressed genes (MEGs) and verified our prognostic model in GSE13213 
and GSE42127 dataset. Finally, cell deconvolution based on the in-house EM-seq 
methylation profile was used to estimate cellular composition of early-stage 
LUAD.
CONCLUSIONS: This study firstly delves into novel pattern of epigenomic DNA 
methylation and provides a multidimensional analysis of the role of DNA 
methylation revealed by EM-seq in early-stage LUAD, providing distinctive 
insights into its potential epigenetic mechanisms.

Somatic evolution selects cancer cell phenotypes that maximize survival and 
proliferation in dynamic environments. Although cancer cells are molecularly 
heterogeneous, we hypothesized convergent adaptive strategies to common host 
selection forces can be inferred from patterns of epigenetic and genetic 
evolutionary selection in similar tumors. We systematically investigated gene 
mutations and expression changes in lung adenocarcinomas with no common driver 
genes (n = 313). Although 13,461 genes were mutated in at least one sample, only 
376 non-synonymous mutations evidenced positive evolutionary selection with 
conservation of 224 genes, while 1736 and 2430 genes exhibited ≥ two-fold 
increased and ≥ 50% decreased expression, respectively. Mutations under positive 
selection are more frequent in genes with significantly altered expression 
suggesting they often ""hardwire"" pre-existing epigenetically driven adaptations. 
Conserved genes averaged 16-fold higher expression in normal lung tissue 
compared to those with selected mutations demonstrating pathways necessary for 
both normal cell function and optimal cancer cell fitness. The convergent LUAD 
phenotype exhibits loss of differentiated functions and cell-cell interactions 
governing tissue organization. Conservation with increased expression is found 
in genes associated with cell cycle, DNA repair, p53 pathway, epigenetic 
modifiers, and glucose metabolism. No canonical driver gene pathways exhibit 
strong positive selection, but extensive down-regulation of membrane ion 
channels suggests decreased transmembrane potential may generate persistent 
proliferative signals. NCD LUADs perform niche construction generating a stiff, 
immunosuppressive microenvironment through selection of specific collagens and 
proteases. NCD LUADs evolve to a convergent phenotype through a network of 
interconnected genetic, epigenetic, and ecological pathways.

People living with HIV (PLWH) are at highest risk of anal cancer and will 
benefit from optimized screening for early disease detection. We compared host 
DNA methylation markers in high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) 
versus samples negative for intraepithelial lesions (NILM) or low-grade 
intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) in PLWH. We recruited PLWH identifying as male 
aged ≥18 years undergoing high-resolution anoscopy (HRA) in Seattle, Washington, 
2015-2016. Anal brush samples were collected for HPV detection, genotyping, and 
pyrosequencing methylation (host genes ASCL1, PAX1, FMN2, and ATP10A); clinical 
data were abstracted from medical records. We assessed associations between 
methylation and presence and extent of HSIL using generalized estimating 
equation logistic regression, adjusting for age, CD4 count and HIV viral load. 
Marker panels using HPV DNA and methylation were also evaluated to predict 
prevalent HSIL. We analyzed 125 samples from 85 participants (mean age 50.1; 
standard deviation 11.0 years). ASCL1 (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] per 1 unit 
increase mean percent methylation: 1.07, 95% CI: 1.01-1.13) and FMN2 (aOR per 1 
unit increase mean percent methylation: 1.14, 95% CI: 1.08-1.20) methylation 
were significantly associated with HSIL versus NILM/LSIL. ASCL1 (aOR: 1.06, 95% 
CI: 1.01-1.11) and FMN2 (aOR: 1.13, 95% CI: 1.08-1.17) methylation were 
positively associated with increasing HSIL extent. A panel combining methylation 
(ASCL1 and FMN2) and HPV DNA (HPV16, HPV18, and HPV31) demonstrated best balance 
of sensitivity (78.2%) and specificity (73.9%) for HSIL detection compared with 
methylation or HPV alone. Increasing levels of DNA methylation of ASCL1 and FMN2 
were positively associated with HSIL detection in PLWH. Host gene methylation 
testing shows promise for HSIL screening and triage.

BACKGROUND: The potential involvement of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) as a 
risk factor for colon cancer (CC) has been previously reported. Epigenetic 
changes, such as deregulation of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and microRNA 
(miR), have been linked to the advancement of CC; however, the effects of high 
glucose levels on their deregulation and, in turn, colon cancer remain 
unexplored.
METHODS: Fifty patients had a dual diagnosis of CC and T2DM, and 60 patients 
with CC without diabetes mellitus were included in the study. qRT-PCR was used 
to examine the expression of lncRNA ANRIL and miR-186-5p in tissue samples. 
ANRIL, miR-186-5p, and their downstream target genes HIF-1α, PFK, HK, Bcl-2, and 
Bax were also determined in CC cell lines under various glucose conditions. 
Glucose uptake, lactate production and cells proliferation were estimated in CC 
cell lines.
RESULTS: A significant upregulation of ANRIL expression levels (p<0.001) and a 
significant downregulation of miR-186-5p expression (p<0.001) in diabetic colon 
cancer specimens compared to those in non-diabetic colon cancer group were 
observed. MiR-186-5p expression levels were inversely correlated with ANRIL 
expression levels, blood glucose levels and HbA1c%. Concerning in vitro model, a 
significant upregulation of ANRIL, downregulation of miR-186-5p, upregulation of 
HIF-1α, glycolytic enzymes and activation of antiapoptotic pathway was detected 
in higher glucose concentrations than lower one. There was a significant 
increase of glucose uptake, lactate accumulation and proliferation of the Caco2 
and SW620 cell lines in a dose dependent manner of glucose concentrations. 
Moreover, a significant positive correlation between glucose uptake and ANRIL 
expression was shown.
CONCLUSIONS: A high-glucose environment can increase the tumor-promoting effect 
of ANRIL. ANRIL can promote glucose metabolism and colon cancer proliferation by 
downregulating miR-186-5p with subsequent upregulation of glycolysis enzymes 
expression and inhibition of apoptosis.

A growing number of studies suggest a positive association between obesity and 
the high incidence of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), suggesting that the 
abnormal levels of adipokines associated with obesity may be a risk factor for 
these aggressive thyroid cancers, but the underlying regulatory mechanisms are 
not yet clear. We downloaded bulk RNA sequence data for subcutaneous adipose 
tissue (SAT) in obesity and healthy population and tumor tissues of PTC from GEO 
database. Through analysis of Differential Expression Genes (DEGs), Gene Set 
Variation Analysis (GSVA) and Weighted Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA), we 
identified co-expressed genes between obesity and PTC, and their pathways were 
mainly enriched in the regulation of B-cells. Furthermore, through TCGA-THCA 
(thyroid carcinoma) cohorts analysis, we identified B-cell regulatory-related 
genes LEF1, TNFRSF13C, SHLD2 and SHLD3 as independent prognostic markers of PTC. 
Next, we explored the transcriptional regulation mechanism of the increased risk 
of PTC in obesity through analysis of DNA methylation CpGs data and single-cell 
RNA sequences (scRNA-seq) from GEO database. PTC-induced hypomethylation of the 
promoter region may be involved in the transcriptional regulation of these 
genes, while these genes were further identified in naive and regulatory B-cells 
of both diseases. Notably, both of the gene expressions in naive and regulatory 
B-cells showed high similarity in both diseases. Our data reveals the high 
frequency of PTC in obese populations may be explained by the comparable 
transcriptional patterns of naive and regulatory B-cells, and offers novel 
insights for the analysis of critical genes and underlying biological mechanisms 
for obesity and PTC.

The DNA methylation levels of host cell genes increase with the severity of the 
cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade and are very high in cervical 
cancer. Our study aims to evaluate FAM19A4 and hsa-miR124-2 methylation in 
Atypical Squamous cells with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (ASC-H) 
and in CIN1, defined as low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSILs) by 
the Bethesda classification, as possible early warning biomarkers for managing 
women with high-risk HPV infections (hrHPV). FAM19A4 and hsa-miR124-2 
methylation tests were conducted on fifty-six cervical screening samples from a 
subset of women aged 30-64 years old. Specimens were collected into ThinPrep 
PreservCyt Solution. Their HrHPV genotype and cytology diagnosis were known. A 
Qiasure (Qiagen) was used for FAM19A4 and hsa-miR124-2 methylation testing on 
bisulfite-converted DNA, according to the manufacturer's specifications. The 
reported results were hypermethylation-positive or -negative. We found that 
FAM194A4 and hsa-miR124-2 methylation was detected in 75% of ASC-H cases with a 
persistent infection of hrHPV. A total of 60% of CIN1 lesions were found to be 
positive for methylation, and 83.3% were when the cytology was CIN2/3. In 
addition, as a novelty of this pilot study, we found that combined FAM19A4 and 
hsa-miR124-2 methylation positivity rates (both methylated) were associated with 
the HPV genotypes 16, 18, and 59 and covered 22 and 25% of ASC-H and CIN1 cases, 
respectively. The methylation of these two genes, in combination with HPV 
genotyping, can be used as an early warning biomarker in the management and 
follow-up of women with ASC-H and CIN1 to avoid their progression to cervical 
cancer.

BACKGROUND: Cancer-related deaths for people with human immunodeficiency virus 
(PWH) are increasing due to longer life expectancies and disparately poor 
cancer-related outcomes. We hypothesize that advanced biological aging 
contributes to cancer-related morbidity and mortality for PWH and cancer. We 
sought to determine the impact of clonal hematopoiesis (CH) on cancer 
disparities in PWH.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study to compare the prevalence and 
clinical outcomes of CH in PWH and people without HIV (PWoH) and cancer. 
Included in the study were PWH and similar PWoH based on tumor site, age, tumor 
sequence, and cancer treatment status. Biological aging was also measured using 
epigenetic methylation clocks.
RESULTS: In 136 patients with cancer, PWH had twice the prevalence of CH 
compared to similar PWoH (23% vs 11%, P = .07). After adjusting for patient 
characteristics, PWH were 4 times more likely than PWoH to have CH (odds ratio, 
4.1 [95% confidence interval, 1.3-13.9]; P = .02). The effect of CH on survival 
was most pronounced in PWH, who had a 5-year survival rate of 38% if they had CH 
(vs 59% if no CH), compared to PWoH who had a 5-year survival rate of 75% if 
they had CH (vs 83% if no CH).
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first evidence that PWH may have a higher 
prevalence of CH than PWoH with the same cancers. CH may be an independent 
biological aging risk factor contributing to inferior survival for PWH and 
cancer.

Effective antitumor immunotherapy depends on evoking a cascade of cancer-immune 
cycles with lymph nodes (LNs) as the initial sites for activating antitumor 
immunity, making drug administration through the lymphatic system highly 
attractive. Here, we describe a nanomedicine with dual responsiveness to pH and 
enzyme for a programmed activation of antitumor immune through the lymphatic 
system. The proposed nanomedicine can release the STING agonist diABZI-C2-NH2 in 
the LNs' acidic environment to activate dendritic cells (DCs) and T cells. Then, 
the remaining nanomedicine hitchhikes on the activated T cells (PD-1+ T cells) 
through binding to PD-1, resulting in an effective delivery into tumor tissues 
owing to the tumor-homing capacity of PD-1+ T cells. The enzyme matrix 
metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) being enriched in tumor tissue triggers the release 
of PD-1 antibody (aPD-1) which exerts immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. 
Eventually, the nanomedicine delivers a DNA methylation inhibitor GSK-3484862 
(GSK) into tumor cells, and then the latter combines with granzyme B (GZMB) to 
trigger tumor cell pyroptosis. Consequently, the pyroptotic tumor cells induce 
robust immunogenic cell death (ICD) enhancing the DCs maturation and initiating 
the cascading antitumor immune response. Study on a 4T1 breast tumor mouse model 
demonstrates the prominent antitumor therapeutic outcome of this nanomedicine 
through creating a positive feedback loop of cancer-immunity cycles including 
immune activation in LNs, T cell-mediated drug delivery, ICB therapy, and tumor 
cell pyroptosis-featured ICD.

There has been increasing interest in the role of epigenetic modification in 
cancers recently. Among the various modifications, sialylation has emerged as a 
dominant subtype implicated in tumor progression, metastasis, immune evasion, 
and chemoresistance. The prognostic significance of sialylation-related 
molecules has been demonstrated in colorectal cancer. However, the potential 
roles and regulatory mechanisms of sialylation in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) 
have not been thoroughly investigated. Through Pearson correlation, univariate 
Cox hazards proportional regression, and random survival forest model analyses, 
we identified several prognostic long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) associated with 
aberrant sialylation and tumor progression, including LINC00857, LINC00968, 
LINC00663, and ITGA9-AS1. Based on the signatures of four lncRNAs, we classified 
patients into two clusters with different landscapes using a non-negative matrix 
factorization approach. Collectively, patients in Cluster 1 (C1) exhibited worse 
prognoses than those in Cluster 2 (C2), as well as heavier tumor mutation 
burden. Functional enrichment analysis showed the enrichment of several 
pro-tumor pathways in C1, differing from the upregulated Longevity and 
programmed cell death pathways in C2. Moreover, we profiled immune infiltration 
levels of important immune cell lineages in two subgroups using MCPcounter 
scores and single sample gene set enrichment analysis scores, revealing a 
relatively immunosuppressive microenvironment in C1. Risk analysis indicated 
that LINC00857 may serve as a pro-tumor regulator, while the other three lncRNAs 
may be protective contributors. Consistently, we observed upregulated LINC00857 
in C1, whereas increased expressive levels of LINC00968, LINC00663, and 
ITGA9-AS1 were observed in C2. Finally, drug sensitivity analysis suggested that 
patients in the two groups may benefit from different therapeutic strategies, 
contributing to precise treatment in LUAD. By integrating multi-omics data, we 
identified four core sialylation-related lncRNAs and successfully established a 
prognostic model to distinguish patients with different characterizations. These 
findings may provide some insights into the underlying mechanism of sialylation, 
and offer a new stratification way as well as clinical guidance in LUAD.

Telomere length (TL) is an important indicator of cellular aging. Shorter TL is 
associated with several age-related diseases including coronary heart disease, 
heart failure, diabetes, osteoporosis, and cancer. Recently, a DNA 
methylation-based TL (DNAmTL) estimator has been developed as an alternative 
method for directly measuring TL. In this study, we examined the association of 
DNAmTL with cancer prevalence and mortality risk among people with and without 
HIV in the Veterans Aging Cohort Study Biomarker Cohort (VACS, N = 1917) and 
Women's Interagency HIV Study Cohort (WIHS, N = 481). We profiled DNAm in whole 
blood (VACS) or in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (WIHS) using an 
array-based method. Cancer prevalence was estimated from electronic medical 
records and cancer registry data. The VACS Index was used as a measure of 
physiologic frailty. Models were adjusted for self-reported race and ethnicity, 
batch, smoking status, alcohol consumption, and five cell types (CD4, CD8, NK, B 
cell, and monocyte). We found that people with HIV had shorter average DNAmTL 
than those without HIV infection [beta = -0.25, 95% confidence interval (-0.32, 
-0.18), p = 1.48E-12]. Greater value of VACS Index [beta = -0.002 (-0.003, 
-0.001), p = 2.82E-05] and higher cancer prevalence [beta = -0.07 (-0.10, 
-0.03), p = 1.37E-04 without adjusting age] were associated with shortened 
DNAmTL. In addition, one kilobase decrease in DNAmTL was associated with a 40% 
increase in mortality risk [hazard ratio: 0.60 (0.44, 0.82), p = 1.42E-03]. In 
summary, HIV infection, physiologic frailty, and cancer are associated with 
shortening DNAmTL, contributing to an increased risk of all-cause mortality.

BACKGROUND: The late presentation and diagnosis of OSCC account for the large 
number of patients with the advanced form of the disease. In Sudan, cases with 
delayed presentation, particularly those with risk factors such as Toombak 
dipping and alcohol consumption, frequently present with extensive lesions and a 
wide area of Field cancerization which characterized by the presence of genetic 
and epigenetic changes in histologically normal-appearing tissues, and have 
increased risk for recurrent and second primary tumors. This necessitates more 
aggressive treatment and is usually associated with poorer outcomes. The present 
study aims to investigate the survival of oral squamous cell carcinoma patients 
with a wide field of cancerization.
METHODS: This prospective longitudinal study includes ninety-three oral cancer 
patients with extensive fields of cancerization who underwent surgical treatment 
at Khartoum Teaching Dental Hospital (KTDH) conducted from 2019 to 2023. These 
patients were regularly assessed for clinical changes such as recurrence, the 
development of second primary tumours, and overall survival over a period of one 
year.
RESULTS: Out of the 93 patients, 57 (61.3%) were males, and 36 (38.7%) were 
females. The majority of the patients (82%) had stage IV tumours, and 62.3% had 
nodal metastasis. Twenty-eight (30%) patients developed recurrences, and 14 
(15%) developed second primary tumours. The overall one-year survival rate was 
89%, and all deceased patients passed away within 12 months. The survival rate 
for patients with different types of recurrences varied, with patients who had 
regional, local, and locoregional recurrences having survival rates of 87%, 74%, 
and 72%, respectively. Patients who did not experience a recurrence had a 
one-year survival rate of 92%. Patients who developed second primary tumours had 
an 86% survival rate. The survival rates for OSCC patients at stages III, IVa, 
and IVb were 90%, 90%, and 71%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: In this study, 62% of patients had nodal metastasis, 30% developed 
recurrence, and 15% developed second primary tumours. The overall one-year 
survival rate was 89%, although the development of recurrences and second 
primary tumours had a negative impact on the survival rate.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Polycyclic aromatic 
hydrocarbons (PAHs) are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP)1A and 1B1 to 
DNA-reactive metabolites, which could lead to mutations in critical genes, 
eventually resulting in cancer. Omega-3 fatty acids, such as eicosapentaenoic 
acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are beneficial against cancers. In 
this investigation, we elucidated the mechanisms by which omega-3 fatty acids 
EPA and DHA will attenuate PAH-DNA adducts and lung carcinogenesis and 
tumorigenesis mediated by the PAHs BP and MC. Adult wild-type (WT) (A/J) mice, 
Cyp1a1-null, Cyp1a2-null, or Cyp1b1-null mice were exposed to PAHs 
benzo[a]pyrene (BP) or 3-methylcholanthrene (MC), and the effects of omega-3 
fatty acid on PAH-mediated lung carcinogenesis and tumorigenesis were studied. 
The major findings were as follows: (i) omega-3 fatty acids significantly 
decreased PAH-DNA adducts in the lungs of each of the genotypes studied; (ii) 
decreases in PAH-DNA adduct levels by EPA/DHA was in part due to inhibition of 
CYP1B1; (iii) inhibition of soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) enhanced the 
EPA/DHA-mediated prevention of pulmonary carcinogenesis; and (iv) EPA/DHA 
attenuated PAH-mediated carcinogenesis in part by epigenetic mechanisms. Taken 
together, our results suggest that omega-3 fatty acids have the potential to be 
developed as cancer chemo-preventive agents in people.

The α-tubulin subtype, Tubulin α-1b chain (TUBA1B), has been shown to influence 
immune cell infiltration, cancer growth, and survival across various 
malignancies. However, a comprehensive study has not yet been undertaken 
examining the immunological and predictive effects of TUBA1B in a pan-carcinoma 
context. Using data from TCGA, GEO, and other databases, we analyzed TUBA1B 
expression across various carcinoma types using transcriptional profiling, 
prognostic implications, genetic and epigenetic alterations, methylation 
patterns, and immunological significance. To validate our findings, we conducted 
Western blot analysis to assess TUBA1B protein levels in matched breast cancer 
tissue samples and performed CCK-8 proliferation assay, flow cytometry, 
transwell invasion, and migration assays to comprehensively examine the 
functional impact of TUBA1B on breast cancer cells. Our pan-cancer analysis 
found TUBA1B upregulation across most tumor types, with varying expression 
patterns in distinct immune and molecular subtypes. High TUBA1B expression was 
an independent risk factor and associated with poor prognoses in several 
cancers, including BRCA, KICH, LGG, LUAD, and MESO. TUBA1B also demonstrates 
moderate to high diagnostic accuracy in most tumor types. Increased m6A 
methylation levels were observed in the TUBA1B gene, while its promoter region 
displayed low methylation levels. TUBA1B's expression impacted some cancers by 
elevating tumor mutation burden, microsatellite instability, neoantigen 
formation, immune cell infiltration, and the modulation of immune checkpoints. 
Functional enrichment analysis highlights TUBA1B's involvement in important 
cellular processes such as the cell cycle, p53 signaling, cell senescence, 
programmed cell death, and the regulation of immune-related pathways. Moreover, 
our study reveals higher TUBA1B protein expression in breast cancer tissues 
compared to adjacent tissues. In vitro experiments confirm that TUBA1B deletion 
reduces breast cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and migration while 
increasing apoptosis. In conclusion, our study suggests that TUBA1B could 
potentially serve as a diagnostic marker for predicting cancer immunological 
profiles and survival outcomes and shed light on the expression and role of 
TUBA1B in breast cancer, providing a solid foundation for considering it as a 
promising therapeutic target for breast cancer patient treatment.

Resistance to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy represents a formidable 
clinical challenge limiting the efficacy of immunotherapy. In particular, 
prostate cancer poses a challenge for ICB therapy due to its immunosuppressive 
features. A ketogenic diet (KD) has been reported to enhance response to ICB 
therapy in some other cancer models. However, adverse effects associated with 
continuous KD were also observed, demanding better mechanistic understanding and 
optimized regimens for using KD as an immunotherapy sensitizer. In this study, 
we established a series of ICB-resistant prostate cancer cell lines and 
developed a highly effective strategy of combining anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 
antibodies with histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) vorinostat, a cyclic KD 
(CKD), or dietary supplementation of the ketone body β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), 
which is an endogenous HDACi. CKD and BHB supplementation each delayed prostate 
cancer tumor growth as monotherapy, and both BHB and adaptive immunity were 
required for the antitumor activity of CKD. Single-cell transcriptomic and 
proteomic profiling revealed that HDACi and ketogenesis enhanced ICB efficacy 
through both cancer cell-intrinsic mechanisms, including upregulation of MHC 
class I molecules, and -extrinsic mechanisms, such as CD8+ T-cell 
chemoattraction, M1/M2 macrophage rebalancing, monocyte differentiation toward 
antigen-presenting cells, and diminished neutrophil infiltration. Overall, these 
findings illuminate a potential clinical path of using HDACi and optimized KD 
regimens to enhance ICB therapy for prostate cancer.
SIGNIFICANCE: Optimized cyclic ketogenic diet and 1,3-butanediol supplementation 
regimens enhance the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade in prostate cancer 
through epigenetic and immune modulations, providing dietary interventions to 
sensitize tumors to immunotherapy.

Intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) of bladder cancer (BLCA) contributes to therapy 
resistance and immune evasion affecting clinical prognosis. The molecular and 
cellular mechanisms contributing to BLCA ITH generation remain elusive. It is 
found that a TM4SF1-positive cancer subpopulation (TPCS) can generate ITH in 
BLCA, evidenced by integrative single cell atlas analysis. Extensive profiling 
of the epigenome and transcriptome of all stages of BLCA revealed their 
evolutionary trajectories. Distinct ancestor cells gave rise to low-grade 
noninvasive and high-grade invasive BLCA. Epigenome reprograming led to 
transcriptional heterogeneity in BLCA. During early oncogenesis, 
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition generated TPCS. TPCS has stem-cell-like 
properties and exhibited transcriptional plasticity, priming the development of 
transcriptionally heterogeneous descendent cell lineages. Moreover, TPCS 
prevalence in tumor is associated with advanced stage cancer and poor prognosis. 
The results of this study suggested that bladder cancer interacts with its 
environment by acquiring a stem cell-like epigenomic landscape, which might 
generate ITH without additional genetic diversification.

Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) significantly impact global health, 
contributing to over 70% of premature deaths, as reported by the World Health 
Organization (WHO). These diseases have complex and multifactorial origins, 
involving genetic, epigenetic, environmental and lifestyle factors. While 
Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) is widely recognized as a valuable tool for 
identifying variants associated with complex phenotypes; the multifactorial 
nature of NCDs necessitates a more comprehensive exploration, encompassing not 
only the genetic but also the epigenetic aspect. For this purpose, we employed a 
bioinformatics-multiomics approach to examine the genetic and epigenetic 
characteristics of NCDs (i.e. colorectal cancer, coronary atherosclerosis, 
squamous cell lung cancer, psoriasis, type 2 diabetes, and multiple sclerosis), 
aiming to identify novel biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis. Leveraging GWAS 
summary statistics, we pinpointed Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) 
independently associated with each NCD. Subsequently, we identified genes linked 
to cell cycle, inflammation and oxidative stress mechanisms, revealing shared 
genes across multiple diseases, suggesting common functional pathways. From an 
epigenetic perspective, we identified microRNAs (miRNAs) with regulatory 
functions targeting these genes of interest. Our findings underscore critical 
genetic pathways implicated in these diseases. In colorectal cancer, the 
dysregulation of the ""Cytokine Signaling in Immune System"" pathway, involving 
LAMA5 and SMAD7, regulated by Hsa-miR-21-5p, Hsa-miR-103a-3p, and 
Hsa-miR-195-5p, emerged as pivotal. In coronary atherosclerosis, the pathway 
associated with ""binding of TCF/LEF:CTNNB1 to target gene promoters"" displayed 
noteworthy implications, with the MYC factor controlled by Hsa-miR-16-5p as a 
potential regulatory factor. Squamous cell lung carcinoma analysis revealed 
significant pathways such as ""PTK6 promotes HIF1A stabilization,"" regulated by 
Hsa-let-7b-5p. In psoriasis, the ""Endosomal/Vacuolar pathway,"" involving HLA-C 
and Hsa-miR-148a-3p and Hsa-miR-148b-3p, was identified as crucial. Type 2 
Diabetes implicated the ""Regulation of TP53 Expression"" pathway, controlled by 
Hsa-miR-106a-5p and Hsa-miR-106b-5p. In conclusion, our study elucidates the 
genetic framework and molecular mechanisms underlying NCDs, offering crucial 
insights into potential genetic/epigenetic biomarkers for diagnosis and 
prognosis. The specificity of pathways and related miRNAs in different 
pathologies highlights promising candidates for further clinical validation, 
with the potential to advance personalized treatments and alleviate the global 
burden of NCDs.

PURPOSE: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play an essential role in the epigenetic 
regulation of various key genes involved in vital cellular functions. A somatic 
dinucleotide mutation in the lncRNA GAS8-AS1 was reported in Chinese papillary 
thyroid cancer. However, GAS8-AS1 dinucleotide alteration and its impact have 
never been explored in differentiated thyroid cancers and other populations.
METHODS: We extracted genomic DNA from 265 DTCs and 97 normal healthy subjects, 
PCR amplified and Sanger sequenced to examine the GAS8-AS1 dinucleotide 
alteration. Calculated genotype/allele frequency to test Hardy-Weinberg 
Equilibrium (HWE) and performed a genetic model of inheritance to determine its 
association with DTC risk. Correlated the GAS8-AS1 dinucleotide variant 
distribution with clinical characteristics to find the association. Predicted 
GAS8-AS1 RNA secondary structure for wild type and variant using RemuRNA and 
RNAfold to assess the conformational changes.
RESULTS: GAS8-AS1 dinucleotide alteration (n.713A > G, rs55742939; n.714T > C, 
rs61118444) identified in DTCs is a germline variant not somatic. The GAS8-AS1 
genotype and allele frequency significantly deviated for HWE in DTCs 
(χ2 = 37.954; p = 0.0001) though not associated with its risk. Dinucleotide 
variant distribution was remarkably associated with early-stage disease 
(p = 0.002), lymph node (p = 0.01), and distant metastasis (p = 0.01) in DTCs. 
The GAS8-AS1 bearing dinucleotide variant markedly showed conformational change 
compared to that of its wild type.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that GAS8-AS1 is genetically deregulated 
and implicated in several stages of DTC tumorigenesis suggesting it could be a 
promising prognostic biomarker in DTCs.

BACKGROUND: 5-Methylcytidine (m5C) methylation is a recently emerging epigenetic 
modification that is closely related to tumor proliferation, occurrence, and 
metastasis. This study aimed to investigate the clinicopathological 
characteristics and prognostic value of m5C regulators in bladder cancer (BLCA), 
and their correlation with the tumor immune microenvironment.
METHODS: Thirteen m5C RNA methylation regulators were analyzed using 
RNA-sequencing and corresponding clinical information obtained from the TCGA 
database. The Cluster Profiler package was used to analyze the gene ontology 
function of potential targets and enriched the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and 
Genomes pathway. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to compare survival 
differences using the log-rank test and univariate Cox proportional hazards 
regression. The correlation between signature prognostic m5C regulators and 
various immune cells was analyzed. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression 
analyses identified independence of the ALYREF gene signature.
RESULTS: Nine out of the 13 m5C RNA methylation regulators were differentially 
expressed in BLCA and normal samples and were co-expressed. These 9 regulators 
were associated with clinicopathological tumor characteristics, particularly 
high or low tumor risk, pT or pTNM stage, and migration. Consensus clustering 
analysis divides the BLCA samples into 4 clusters. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes 
and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment annotation and gene ontology function 
analysis identified 273 upregulated and 594 downregulated genes in BLCA. 
Notably, only ALYREF was significantly correlated with OS (P < .05). ALYREF 
exhibited significant infiltration levels in macrophage cells. Therefore, we 
constructed a nomogram for ALYREF as an independent prognostic factor. 
Additionally, we observed that both the mRNA and protein levels of ALYREF were 
upregulated, and immunofluorescence showed that ALYREF was mainly distributed in 
nuclear speckles. ALYREF overexpression was significantly associated with poor 
OS.
CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrated the potential of ALYREF to predict 
clinical prognostic risks in BLCA patients and regulate the tumor immune 
microenvironment. As such, ALYREF may serve as a novel prognostic indicator in 
BLCA patients.

Cuproptosis a novel copper-dependent cell death modality, plays a crucial part 
in the oncogenesis, progression and prognosis of tumors. However, the 
relationships among DNA-methylation located in cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs), 
overall survival (OS) and the tumor microenvironment remain undefined. In this 
study, we systematically assessed the prognostic value of CRG-located 
DNA-methylation for lower-grade glioma (LGG). Clinical and molecular data were 
sourced from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) 
databases. We employed Cox hazard regression to examine the associations between 
CRG-located DNA-methylation and OS, leading to the development of a prognostic 
signature. Kaplan-Meier survival and time-dependent receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) analyses were utilized to gauge the accuracy of the 
signature. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was applied to uncover potential 
biological functions of differentially expressed genes between high- and 
low-risk groups. A three CRG-located DNA-methylation prognostic signature was 
established based on TCGA database and validated in GEO dataset. The 1-year, 
3-year, and 5-year area under the curve (AUC) of ROC curves in the TCGA dataset 
were 0.884, 0.888, and 0.859 while those in the GEO dataset were 0.943, 0.761 
and 0.725, respectively. Cox-regression-analyses revealed the risk signature as 
an independent risk factor for LGG patients. Immunogenomic profiling suggested 
that the signature was associated with immune infiltration level and immune 
checkpoints. Functional enrichment analysis indicated differential enrichment in 
cell differentiation in the hindbrain, ECM receptor interactions, glycolysis and 
reactive oxygen species pathway across different groups. We developed and 
verified a novel CRG-located DNA-methylation signature to predict the prognosis 
in LGG patients. Our findings emphasize the potential clinical implications of 
CRG-located DNA-methylation indicating that it may serve as a promising 
therapeutic target for LGG patients.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a type of neoplasm, developing in the 
colon or rectum. The exact etiology of CRC is not well known, but the role of 
genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors are established in its 
pathogenesis. Therefore, the aim of this research was to explore the effects of 
ANRIL polymorphisms on the CRC and its clinical findings.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The peripheral blood specimens were collected from 142 CRC 
patients and 225 controls referred to Milad Hospital, Tehran, Iran. PCR- RFLP 
method was used to analyze ANRIL rs1333040, rs10757274 rs4977574, and rs1333048 
polymorphisms. The ANRIL rs1333040 polymorphism was related to a higher risk of 
CRC in the co-dominant, dominant, and log-additive models. ANRIL rs10757274, 
rs4977574, and rs1333048 polymorphisms showed no effect on CRC susceptibility. 
The CGAA and TGGA haplotypes of ANRIL rs1333040/ rs10757274/ rs4977574/rs1333048 
polymorphisms were associated with the higher and the lower risk of CRC 
respectively. The rs1333040 polymorphism was associated with higher TNM stages 
(III and IV). The frequency of ANRIL rs10757274 polymorphism was lower in CRC 
patients over 50 years of age only in the dominant model. In addition, the 
rs10757274 was associated with well differentiation in CRC patients.
CONCLUSION: The ANRIL rs1333040 polymorphism was associated with a higher risk 
of CRC and higher TNM stages. ANRIL rs10757274 polymorphism was associated with 
the well-differentiated tumor in CRC.

Traditional clinical modalities for diagnosing bladder urothelial carcinoma 
(BUC) remain limited due to their invasive nature, significant costs, discomfort 
associated with cystoscopy, and low sensitivity to urine cytology. Therefore, 
there is an urgent need to identify highly sensitive, specific, and noninvasive 
biomarkers for the early detection of this neoplasm. Hypermethylated 
TWIST1/Vimentin promoter may be a noninvasive biomarker using urine sample. We 
assessed the TWIST1/Vimentin promoter methylation status in urine samples using 
the Methylated Human TWIST1 and Vimentin Gene Detection Kit (Jiangsu MicroDiag 
Biomedicine Co., Ltd., China). The samples were collected from five groups: 
group 1 consisted of patients with BUC, group 2 contained other patients with 
urologic tumors, group 3 consisted of patients with benign diseases (e.g., 
urinary tract infections, lithiasis, and benign prostatic hyperplasia), Group 4 
included UTUC (upper tract urothelial carcinoma) patients and group5 comprised 
healthy individuals. The study encompassed 77 BUC patients, and we evaluated the 
degree of methylation of the TWIST1/Vimentin gene in their urine samples. 
Notably, TWIST1/Vimentin positivity was significantly elevated in comparison to 
groups 2, 3 and 5 (all p < 0.001) at a rate of 77.9%, but no significant 
difference was observed when compared to group 4. In the relationship between 
TWIST1/Vimentin methylation and clinicopathological features of BC patients from 
our center, we found there was no significant association between 
TWIST1/Vimentin status and proteinuria and/or hematuria, and hypermethylation of 
TWIST1 / VIM genes was found in both high and low tumor grade and in both 
non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (stages Tis, Ta, or T1) and muscle-invasive 
bladder cancer (stage T2 or above). In the multivariable analysis for cancer 
detection, a positive TWIST1/Vimentin methylation were significantly linked to a 
heightened risk of BC. Moreover, TWIST1/Vimentin promoter methylation 
demonstrated an ability to detect BUC in urine samples with a sensitivity of 78% 
and a specificity of 83%. Our findings reveal that hypermethylation of the 
TWIST1/Vimentin promoter occurs in bladder urothelial carcinoma, and its high 
sensitivity and specificity suggest its potential as a screening and therapeutic 
biomarker for urothelial carcinoma of the bladder.

The precise determination of DNA methylation at specific sites is critical for 
the timely detection of cancer, as DNA methylation is closely associated with 
the initiation and progression of cancer. Herein, a novel ratiometric 
fluorescence method based on the methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme 
(MSRE), CRISPR/Cas12a, and catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) amplification were 
developed to detect site-specific methylation with high sensitivity and 
specificity. In detail, AciI, one of the commonly used MSREs, was employed to 
distinguish the methylated target from nonmethylated targets. The CRISPR/Cas12a 
system was utilized to recognize the site-specific target. In this process, the 
protospacer adjacent motif and crRNA-dependent identification, the single-base 
resolution of Cas12a, can effectively ensure detection specificity. The 
trans-cleavage ability of Cas12a can convert one target into abundant activators 
and can then trigger the CHA reaction, leading to the accomplishment of cascaded 
signal amplification. Moreover, with the structural change of the hairpin probe 
during CHA, two labeled dyes can be spatially separated, generating a change of 
the Förster resonance energy transfer signal. In general, the proposed strategy 
of tandem CHA after the CRISPR/Cas12a reaction not only avoids the generation of 
false-positive signals caused by the target-similar nucleic acid but can also 
improve the sensitivity. The use of ratiometric fluorescence can eradicate 
environmental effects by self-calibration. Consequently, the proposed approach 
had a detection limit of 2.02 fM. This approach could distinguish between 
colorectal cancer and precancerous tissue, as well as between colorectal 
patients and healthy people. Therefore, the developed method can serve as an 
excellent site-specific methylation detection tool, which is promising for 
biological and disease studies.

Bladder cancer, a common neoplasm, is primarily caused by tobacco smoking. 
Epigenetic alterations including DNA methylation have the potential to be used 
as prospective markers of increased risk, particularly in at-risk populations 
such as smokers. We aimed to investigate the potential of smoking-related white 
blood cell (WBC) methylation markers to contribute to an increase in bladder 
cancer risk prediction over classical questionnaire-based smoking metrics (i.e., 
duration, intensity, packyears) in a nested case-control study within the 
prospective prostate, lung, colorectal, and ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening 
Trial and the alpha-tocopherol, beta-carotene cancer (ATBC) Prevention Study 
(789 cases; 849 controls). We identified 200 differentially methylated sites 
associated with smoking status and 28 significantly associated (after correction 
for multiple testing) with bladder cancer risk among 2670 previously reported 
smoking-related cytosine-phosphate-guanines sites (CpGs). Similar patterns were 
observed across cohorts. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses 
indicated that cg05575921 (AHHR), the strongest smoking-related association we 
identified for bladder cancer risk, alone yielded similar predictive performance 
(AUC: 0.60) than classical smoking metrics (AUC: 0.59-0.62). Best prediction was 
achieved by including the first principal component (PC1) from the 200 
smoking-related CpGs alongside smoking metrics (AUC: 0.63-0.65). Further, PC1 
remained significantly associated with elevated bladder cancer risk after 
adjusting for smoking metrics. These findings suggest DNA methylation profiles 
reflect aspects of tobacco smoke exposure in addition to those captured by 
smoking duration, intensity and packyears, and/or individual susceptibility 
relevant to bladder cancer etiology, warranting further investigation.

BACKGROUND: REEP4 is involved in the regulation of the biological process of 
mitosis. Lower grade glioma (LGG), as a malignant tumor, is accompanied by 
abnormalities in mitosis, but there have been no reports of REEP4 so far.
METHODS: We collected transcriptome data, DNA methylation data and the clinical 
characteristics of thousands of patients with LGG. Various big data analysis 
methods and molecular biology experiments were employed to reveal the impact of 
REEP4 on the pathological process of LGG.
RESULTS: It was found that the expression of REEP4 was significantly elevated 
and negatively regulated by its methylation site. Therefore, both the high 
expression of REEP4 and low methylation state of cg16311504 showed that the 
patients are correlated with lower patient survival rate. In addition, high 
REEP4 expression participates in the regulation of various cancer-related 
cellular signaling pathways, such as the cell cycle, MAPK signaling pathway, 
NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, etc. More importantly, the level of immune 
cell infiltration significantly increased in the high expression group of REEP4 
in the LGG tumor microenvironment and REEP4 has a high positive correlation with 
PD-L1 and other immune checkpoints.
CONCLUSIONS: In brief, this study is the first to introduce REEP4 in malignant 
tumors, which can be used as an independent risk factor that participates in the 
malignant process of LGG. More importantly, REEP4 has the potential to become a 
new star in the field of anti-tumor treatment.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a complex malignancy characterized by 
diverse molecular profiles, clinical outcomes, and limited precision in 
prognostic markers. Addressing these challenges, this study utilized multi-omics 
data to define consensus molecular subtypes in CRC and elucidate their 
association with clinical outcomes and underlying biological processes.
METHODS: Consensus molecular subtypes were obtained by applying ten integrated 
multi-omics clustering algorithms to analyze TCGA-CRC multi-omics data, 
including mRNA, lncRNA, miRNA, DNA methylation CpG sites, and somatic mutation 
data. The association of subtypes with prognoses, enrichment functions, immune 
status, and genomic alterations were further analyzed. Next, we conducted 
univariate Cox and Lasso regression analyses to investigate the potential 
prognostic application of biomarkers associated with multi-omics subtypes 
derived from weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). The function 
of one of the biomarkers MID2 was validated in CRC cell lines.
RESULTS: Two CRC subtypes linked to distinct clinical outcomes were identified 
in TCGA-CRC cohort and validated with three external datasets. The CS1 subtype 
exhibited a poor prognosis and was characterized by higher tumor-related 
Hallmark pathway activity and lower metabolism pathway activity. In addition, 
the CS1 was predicted to have less immunotherapy responder and exhibited more 
genomic alteration compared to CS2. Then a prognostic model comprising five 
genes was established, with patients in the high-risk group showing substantial 
concordance with the CS1 subtype, and those in the low-risk group with the CS2 
subtype. The gene MID2, included in the prognostic model, was found to be 
correlated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway and distinct DNA 
methylation patterns. Knockdown of MID2 in CRC cells resulted in reduced colony 
formation, migration, and invasion capacities.
CONCLUSION: The integrative multi-omics subtypes proposed potential biomarkers 
for CRC and provided valuable knowledge for precision oncology.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most prevalent cancer in children, and 
despite considerable progress in treatment outcomes, relapses still pose 
significant risks of mortality and long-term complications. To address this 
challenge, we employed a supervised machine learning technique, specifically 
random survival forests, to predict the risk of relapse and mortality using 
array-based DNA methylation data from a cohort of 763 pediatric ALL patients 
treated in Nordic countries. The relapse risk predictor (RRP) was constructed 
based on 16 CpG sites, demonstrating c-indexes of 0.667 and 0.677 in the 
training and test sets, respectively. The mortality risk predictor (MRP), 
comprising 53 CpG sites, exhibited c-indexes of 0.751 and 0.754 in the training 
and test sets, respectively. To validate the prognostic value of the predictors, 
we further analyzed two independent cohorts of Canadian (n = 42) and Nordic 
(n = 384) ALL patients. The external validation confirmed our findings, with the 
RRP achieving a c-index of 0.667 in the Canadian cohort, and the RRP and MRP 
achieving c-indexes of 0.529 and 0.621, respectively, in an independent Nordic 
cohort. The precision of the RRP and MRP models improved when incorporating 
traditional risk group data, underscoring the potential for synergistic 
integration of clinical prognostic factors. The MRP model also enabled the 
definition of a risk group with high rates of relapse and mortality. Our results 
demonstrate the potential of DNA methylation as a prognostic factor and a tool 
to refine risk stratification in pediatric ALL. This may lead to personalized 
treatment strategies based on epigenetic profiling.

BACKGROUND: Myelofibrosis is the most aggressive subtype among classical 
BCR::ABL1 negative myeloproliferative neoplasms. About 90% of cases are driven 
by constitutive activation of 1 of 3 genes impacting the JAK/STAT pathway: JAK2, 
CALR, and MPL. Triple-negative myelofibrosis (TN-MF) accounts for only 5%-10% of 
cases and carries the worst outcomes. Little has been described about this 
subset of disease. Given the marked heterogeneity surrounding disease biology, 
clonal architecture, clinical presentation, and poor outcomes in TN-MF, 
identification of features of interest and assessment of treatment response are 
areas in need of further investigation.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We collected and evaluated baseline clinical and molecular 
parameters from 626 patients with a diagnosis of myelofibrosis who presented to 
the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa (Florida, US) between 2003 and 2021 
and compared them based on presence or absence of the three classical phenotypic 
driver mutations.
RESULTS: A small proportion of patients (6%) harbored TN-MF which correlated 
with inferior outcomes, marked by a 4-year reduction in overall survival time 
compared to the non-TN cohort (mOS 37.4 months vs. 85.7 months; P = .009) and 
higher rates of leukemic transformation. More pronounced thrombocytopenia and 
anemia, lower LDH, EPO levels, as well as lower percentage of marrow blasts at 
baseline were more commonly seen in TN-MF (P < .05). Similarly, patients with 
TN-MF had higher risk disease per DIPSS+ and GIPSS. Mutations impacting RNA 
splicing, epigenetic modification and signaling, specifically SRSF2, SETBP1, 
IDH2, CBL, and GNAS, were more commonly seen among those lacking a classical 
phenotypic driver. The prevalence of co-mutant ASXL1/SRSF2 clones was 
significantly higher in TN-MF as was trisomy 8. TN patients had fewer responses 
(46.2% vs. 63.4%) and shorter duration of response to ruxolitinib.
CONCLUSION: TN-MF is invariably associated with significantly decreased survival 
and more aggressive clinical behavior with higher rates of leukemic 
transformation and shorter duration of response to ruxolitinib. Mutations 
impacting RNA splicing, epigenetic modification and signaling (SRSF2, SETBP1, 
IDH2, CBL, and GNAS) are more common in TN-MF, which likely drive its aggressive 
course and may account for suboptimal responses to JAK inhibition.

Breast cancer (BC) and ovarian cancer (OC) are rapidly increasing in Saudi 
Arabia. BRCA1 and MGMT epimutations have been linked to a higher risk of these 
malignancies. The present research investigated the impact of these epimutations 
on the prevalence of BC and OC among Saudi women. DNA methylation was evaluated 
using methylation-specific PCR, whereas mRNA expression levels were assessed 
using qRT-PCR. We evaluated white blood cell (WBC)-BRCA1 methylation in 1958 
Saudi women (908 BC patients, 223 OC patients, and 827 controls). MGMT 
methylation was determined in 1534 of the 1958 women (700 BC patients, 223 OC 
patients, and 611 controls). BRCA1 methylation was detected in 8.6% of the 
controls and 11% of the BC patients. This epimutation was linked to 13.8% of the 
early-onset BC patients (p = 0.003) and 20% of the triple-negative breast cancer 
(TNBC) patients (p = 0.0001). BRCA1 methylation was also detected in 14% of the 
OC patients (p = 0.011), 19.4% of patients aged <55 years (p = 0.0007), and 
23.4% of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) patients. In contrast, the 
BRCA1 mutation was detected in 24% of the OC patients, 27.4% of patients aged 
≥55 years, and 26.7% of the HGSOC patients. However, MGMT methylation was 
detected in 10% of the controls and 17.4% of the BC patients (p = 0.0003). This 
epimutation was linked to 26.4% of the late-onset BC patients (p = 0.0001) and 
11% of the TNBC patients. MGMT methylation was also found in 15.2% of the OC 
patients (p = 0.034) and 19.1% of HGSOC patients (p = 0.054). Furthermore, 36% 
of the BRCA1-methylated patients and 34.5% of the MGMT-methylated patients had a 
family history of cancer, including breast and ovarian cancer. Notably, BRCA1 
and MGMT mRNA levels were greater in the WBC RNA of the BC patients and 
cancer-free methylation carriers than in that of the OC patients. Our data 
indicate that BRCA1 and MGMT epimutations significantly contribute to the 
development of breast cancer and ovarian cancer in Saudi cancer patients. These 
blood-based biomarkers could help identify female patients at high risk of 
developing TNBC and HGSOC at an early age.

Chemoresistance is a major cause of treatment failure in many cancers. However, 
the life cycle of cancer cells as they respond to and survive environmental and 
therapeutic stress is understudied. In this study, we utilized a microfluidic 
device to induce the development of doxorubicin-resistant (DOXR) cells from 
triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells within 11 days by generating 
gradients of DOX and medium. In vivo chemoresistant xenograft models, an 
unbiased genome-wide transcriptome analysis, and a patient data/tissue analysis 
all showed that chemoresistance arose from failed epigenetic control of the 
nuclear protein-1 (NUPR1)/histone deacetylase 11 (HDAC11) axis, and high NUPR1 
expression correlated with poor clinical outcomes. These results suggest that 
the chip can rapidly induce resistant cells that increase tumor heterogeneity 
and chemoresistance, highlighting the need for further studies on the epigenetic 
control of the NUPR1/HDAC11 axis in TNBC.

INTRODUCTION: Methylation assays have demonstrated potential as dependable and 
high-precision approaches for identifying or triaging individuals with cervical 
cancer (CA) or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). Our investigation aimed 
to assess the efficacy of the diagnosis and triage of the PAX1/SOX1 methylation 
panel in detecting CIN or CA.
METHODS: A total of 461 patients with abnormal high-risk human papillomavirus 
(hrHPV) or cytology test results were recruited for this study. Each patient 
underwent an assortment of assessments, comprising a cytology test, hrHPV test, 
colposcopy examination, and PAX1 and SOX1 methylation tests.
RESULTS: The extent of methylation of both genes demonstrates a positive 
correlation with the severity of CIN lesions and CA. To determine the 
correlation for patients with CIN2 or worse (CIN2+), the area under curve was 
0.821 (95% CI: 0.782-0.853) for PAX1 and 0.800 (95% CI: 0.766-0.838) for SOX1, 
while for CIN3 or worse (CIN3+), 0.881 (95% CI: 0.839-0.908) for PAX1 and 0.867 
(95% CI: 0.830-0.901) for SOX1. The PAX1/SOX1 methylation marker panel performed 
sensitivity and specificity of 77.16% and 91.67% for CIN2+, 84.76% and 90.50% 
for CIN3+, respectively. Regarding triaging hrHPV+ patients, the PAX1/SOX1 
methylation test only referred 11.83% of the patients who are unnecessary for 
colonoscopy examination, which is comparatively lower than cytology, thereby 
signifying a promising triage strategy for hrHPV-positive women. Furthermore, we 
observed that the positive PAX1/SOX1 methylation test result for untreated CIN1 
or fewer patients would result in a higher likelihood of progression upon a 
24-month follow-up visit.
CONCLUSION: The present investigation demonstrates that the PAX1/SOX1 
methylation marker panel exhibits favorable diagnostic performance in CIN 
detection and holds the potential to be employed for individual CIN tests or 
hrHPV-positive triage.

The causal relationship between gut microbiota (GM) and pancreatic cancer (PC) 
remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the potential genes underlying 
this mechanism. GM Genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary data were from 
the MiBioGen consortium. PC GWAS data were from the National Human Genome 
Research Institute-European Bioinformatics Institute (NHGRI-EBI) GWAS Catalogue. 
To detect the causal relationship between GM and PC, we implemented three 
complementary Mendelian randomization (MR) methods: Inverse Variance Weighting 
(IVW), MR-Egger and Weighted Median, followed by sensitivity analyses. 
Furthermore, we integrated GM GWAS data with blood cis-expression quantitative 
trait loci (eQTLs) and blood cis-DNA methylation QTL (mQTLs) using Summary 
data-based Mendelian Randomization (SMR) methods. This integration aimed to 
prioritize potential GM-affecting genes through SMR analysis of two molecular 
traits. PC cis-eQTLs and cis-mQTLs were summarized from The Cancer Genome Atlas 
(TCGA) data. Through colocalization analysis of GM cis-QTLs and PC cis-QTLs 
data, we identified common genes that influence both GM and PC. Our study found 
a causal association between GM and PC, including four protective and five 
risk-associated GM [Inverse Variance Weighted (IVW), p < 0.05]. No significant 
heterogeneity of instrumental variables (IVs) or horizontal pleiotropy was 
found. The gene SVBP was identified as a GM-affecting gene using SMR analysis of 
two molecular traits (FDR<0.05, P_HEIDI>0.05). Additionally, two genes, MCM6 and 
RPS26, were implicated in the interaction between GM and PC based on 
colocalization analysis (PPH4>0.5). In summary, this study provides evidence for 
future research aimed at developing suitable therapeutic interventions and 
disease prevention.

Accurately identifying life-threatening prostate cancer (PCa) at time of 
diagnosis remains an unsolved problem. We evaluated whether DNA methylation 
status of selected candidate genes can predict the risk of metastasis beyond 
clinical risk factors in men with untreated PCa. A nested case-control study was 
conducted among men diagnosed with localized PCa at Kaiser Permanente California 
between 01/01/1997-12/31/2006 who did not receive curative treatments. Cases 
were those who developed metastasis within 10 years from diagnosis. Controls 
were selected using density sampling. Ninety-eight candidate genes were selected 
from functional categories of cell cycle control, metastasis/tumour suppressors, 
cell signalling, cell adhesion/motility/invasion, angiogenesis, and immune 
function, and 41 from pluripotency genes. Cancer DNA from diagnostic biopsy 
blocks were extracted and analysed. Associations of methylation status were 
assessed using CpG site level and principal components-based analysis in 
conditional logistic regressions. In 215 cases and 404 controls, 27 candidate 
genes were found to be statistically significant in at least one of the two 
analytical approaches. The agreement between the methods was 25.9% (7 candidate 
genes, including 2 pluripotency markers). The DNA methylation status of several 
candidate genes was significantly associated with risk of metastasis in 
untreated localized PCa patients. These findings may inform future risk 
prediction models for PCa metastasis beyond clinical characteristics.

Prostate cancer is the leading incident cancer among men in the United States. 
Firefighters are diagnosed with this disease at a rate 1.21 times higher than 
the average population. This increased risk may result from occupational 
exposures to many toxicants, including per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances 
(PFAS). This study assessed the association between firefighting as an 
occupation in general or PFAS serum levels, with DNA methylation. Only genomic 
regions previously linked to prostate cancer risk were selected for analysis: 
GSTP1, Alu repetitive elements, and the 8q24 chromosomal region. There were 444 
male firefighters included in this study, with some analyses being conducted on 
fewer participants due to missingness. Statistical models were used to test 
associations between exposures and DNA methylation at CpG sites in the selected 
genomic regions. Exposure variables included proxies of cumulative firefighting 
exposures (incumbent versus academy status and years of firefighting experience) 
and biomarkers of PFAS exposures (serum concentrations of 9 PFAS). Proxies of 
cumulative exposures were associated with DNA methylation at 15 CpG sites and 
one region located within FAM83A (q-value <0.1). SbPFOA was associated with 19 
CpG sites (q < 0.1), but due to low detection rates, this PFAS was modeled as 
detected versus not detected in serum. Overall, there is evidence that 
firefighting experience is associated with differential DNA methylation in 
prostate cancer risk loci, but this study did not find evidence that these 
differences are due to PFAS exposures specifically.

Recursive partitioning of healthy consortia led to the development of the Clonal 
Hematopoiesis Risk Score (CHRS) for clonal haematopoiesis (CH); however, in the 
practical setting, most cases of CH are diagnosed after patients present with 
cytopenias or related symptoms. To address this real-world population, we 
characterize the clinical trajectories of 94 patients with CH and distinguish CH 
harbouring canonical DNMT3A/TET2/ASXL1 mutations alone ('sole DTA') versus all 
other groups ('non-sole DTA'). TET2, rather than DNMT3A, was the most prevalent 
mutation in the real-world setting. Sole DTA patients did not progress to 
myeloid neoplasm (MN) in the absence of acquisition of other mutations. 
Contrastingly, 14 (20.1%) of 67 non-sole DTA patients progressed to MN. CHRS 
assessment showed a higher frequency of high-risk CH in non-sole DTA (vs. sole 
DTA) patients and in progressors (vs. non-progressors). RUNX1 mutation conferred 
the strongest risk for progression to MN (odds ratio [OR] 10.27, 95% CI 
2.00-52.69, p = 0.0053). The mean variant allele frequency across all genes was 
higher in progressors than in non-progressors (36.9% ± 4.62% vs. 24.1% ± 1.67%, 
p = 0.0064). This analysis in the post-CHRS era underscores the natural history 
of CH, providing insight into patterns of progression to MN.

Genomic epigenetics of extracellular matrix (ECM) play an important role in lung 
adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Our study identified a signature of potential prognostic 
genes associated with ECM and constructed immune risk-related prognosis model in 
LUAD. We downloaded mRNAs transcriptome data, miRNAs expression data, and 
clinical patient information for LUAD based on The Cancer Genome Atlas. ""Limma, 
clusterProfiler, ggplot2"" R packages and GSEA were used to analyze meaningful 
genes and explore potential biological function. A competing endogenous RNA 
network was constructed to reveal the mechanism of ECM-related genes. Combined 
with clinical LUAD patients' characteristics, univariate and multivariate Cox 
regression analyses were used to build prognostic immune risk model. Next, we 
calculated AUC value of ROC curve, and explored survival probability of 
different risk groups. A total of 2966 mRNAs were differently expressed in LUAD 
samples and normal samples. Function enrichment analyses proved mRNAs were 
associated with many tumor pathways, such as cell adhesion, vascular smooth 
muscle contraction, and cell cycle. There were 18 mRNAs related to ECM receptor 
signaling pathway, and 7 mRNAs expressions were correlated with EGFR expression, 
but only 5mRNAs were associated with the long-term prognosis. Based on Integrin 
alpha-8 (ITGA8) molecule, we identified potential 3 miRNAs from several 
databases. The promoter of ITGA8 was higher-methylated and lower-expressed in 
LUAD. And lower-expressed group has poor prognosis for patients. 66 
immunomodulators related to ITGA8 were performed to construct immune correlation 
prediction model (p < 0.05). Comprehensive analyses of ITGA8 revealed it 
combined focal adhesion kinase to activate PI3K/AKT signaling pathway to 
influence the occurrence and development of LUAD. A novel immune prognostic 
model about ITGA8 was constructed and verified in LUAD patients. Combined with 
non-coding genes and genomic epigenetics, identification of potential biomarkers 
provided new light on therapeutic strategy for clinical patients.

Methylation markers have shown potential for triaging high-risk HPV-positive 
(hrHPV+) women to identify those at increased risk of invasive cervical cancer 
(ICC). Our aim was to assess the performance of the S5 DNA methylation 
classifier for predicting incident high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 
(CIN) and ICC among hrHPV+ women in the ARTISTIC screening trial cohort. The S5 
classifier, comprising target regions of tumour suppressor gene EPB41L3 and L1 
and L2 regions of HPV16, HPV18, HPV31, and HPV33, was assayed by pyrosequencing 
in archived hrHPV+ liquid-based samples from 343 women with high-grade disease 
(139 CIN2, 186 CIN3, and 18 ICC) compared to 800 hrHPV+ controls. S5 DNA 
methylation correlated directly with increasing severity of disease and 
inversely with lead time to diagnosis. S5 could discriminate between hrHPV+ 
women who developed CIN3 or ICC and hrHPV+ controls (p <.0001) using samples 
taken on average 5 years before diagnosis. This relationship was independent of 
cytology at baseline. The S5 test showed much higher sensitivity than HPV16/18 
genotyping for identifying prevalent CIN3 (93% vs. 61%, p = .01) but lower 
specificity (50% vs. 66%, p <.0001). The S5 classifier identified most women at 
high risk of developing precancer and missed very few prevalent advanced lesions 
thus appearing to be an objective test for triage of hrHPV+ women. The 
combination of methylation of host and HPV genes enables S5 to combine the 
predictive power of methylation with HPV genotyping to identify hrHPV-positive 
women who are at highest risk of developing CIN3 and ICC in the future.

Tobacco use is a major modifiable risk factor for adverse health outcomes, 
including cancer, and elicits profound epigenetic changes thought to be 
associated with long-term cancer risk. While electronic cigarettes 
(e-cigarettes) have been advocated as harm reduction alternatives to tobacco 
products, recent studies have revealed potential detrimental effects, 
highlighting the urgent need for further research into the molecular and health 
impacts of e-cigarettes. Here, we applied computational deconvolution methods to 
dissect the cell- and tissue-specific epigenetic effects of tobacco or 
e-cigarette use on DNA methylation (DNAme) in over 3,500 buccal/saliva, 
cervical, or blood samples, spanning epithelial and immune cells at directly and 
indirectly exposed sites. The 535 identified smoking-related DNAme loci 
[cytosine-phosphate-guanine sites (CpG)] clustered into four functional groups, 
including detoxification or growth signaling, based on cell type and anatomic 
site. Loci hypermethylated in buccal epithelial cells of smokers associated with 
NOTCH1/RUNX3/growth factor receptor signaling also exhibited elevated 
methylation in cancer tissue and progressing lung carcinoma in situ lesions, and 
hypermethylation of these sites predicted lung cancer development in buccal 
samples collected from smokers up to 22 years prior to diagnosis, suggesting a 
potential role in driving carcinogenesis. Alarmingly, these CpGs were also 
hypermethylated in e-cigarette users with a limited smoking history. This study 
sheds light on the cell type-specific changes to the epigenetic landscape 
induced by smoking-related products.
SIGNIFICANCE: The use of both cigarettes and e-cigarettes elicits cell- and 
exposure-specific epigenetic effects that are predictive of carcinogenesis, 
suggesting caution when broadly recommending e-cigarettes as aids for smoking 
cessation.

BACKGROUND: Nodular gastritis (NG) is characterized by marked antral lymphoid 
follicle formation, and is a strong risk factor for diffuse-type gastric cancer 
in adults. However, it is unknown whether aberrant DNA methylation, which is 
induced by atrophic gastritis (AG) and is a risk for gastric cancer, is induced 
by NG. Here, we analyzed methylation induction by NG.
METHODS: Gastric mucosal samples were obtained from non-cancerous antral tissues 
of 16 NG and 20 AG patients with gastric cancer and 5 NG and 6 AG patients 
without, all age- and gender-matched. Genome-wide methylation analysis and 
expression analysis were conducted by a BeadChip array and RNA-sequencing, 
respectively.
RESULTS: Clustering analysis of non-cancerous antral tissues of NG and AG 
patients with gastric cancer was conducted using methylation levels of 585 
promoter CpG islands (CGIs) of methylation-resistant genes, and a large fraction 
of NG samples formed a cluster with strong methylation induction. Promoter CGIs 
of CDH1 and DAPK1 tumor-suppressor genes were more methylated in NG than in AG. 
Notably, methylation levels of these genes were also higher in the antrum of NG 
patients without cancer. Genes related to lymphoid follicle formation, such as 
CXCL13/CXCR5 and CXCL12/CXCR4, had higher expression in NG, and genes involved 
in DNA demethylation TET2 and IDH1, had only half the expression in NG.
CONCLUSIONS: Severe aberrant methylation, involving multiple tumor-suppressor 
genes, was induced in the gastric antrum and body of patients with NG, in 
accordance with their high gastric cancer risk.

Cell senescence genes play a vital role in the pathogenesis of colorectal 
cancer, a process that may involve the triggering of genetic variations and 
reversible phenotypes caused by epigenetic modifications. However, the specific 
regulatory mechanisms remain unclear. Using CellAge and The Cancer Genome Atlas 
databases and in-house RNA-seq data, DNA methylation-modified cellular 
senescence genes (DMCSGs) were validated by Support Vector Machine and 
correlation analyses. In 1150 cases and 1342 controls, we identified colorectal 
cancer risk variants in DMCSGs. The regulatory effects of gene, variant, and DNA 
methylation were explored through dual-luciferase and 5-azacytidine treatment 
experiments, complemented by multiple database analyses. Biological functions of 
key gene were evaluated via cell proliferation assays, SA-β-gal staining, 
senescence marker detection, and immune infiltration analyses. The genetic 
variant rs4558926 in the downstream of TACC3 was significantly associated with 
colorectal cancer risk (OR = 1.35, P = 3.22 × 10-4). TACC3 mRNA expression 
increased due to rs4558926 C > G and decreased DNA methylation levels. The CpG 
sites in the TACC3 promoter region were regulated by rs4558926. TACC3 knockdown 
decreased proliferation and senescence in colorectal cancer cells. In addition, 
subjects with high-TACC3 expression presented an immunosuppressive 
microenvironment. These findings provide insights into the involvement of 
genetic variants of cellular senescence genes in the development and progression 
of colorectal cancer.

The crosstalk between oncogenic signaling pathways plays a crucial role in 
driving cancer development. We previously demonstrated that dietary polyphenols, 
specifically resveratrol (RSV) and other stilbenoids, epigenetically target 
oncogenes for silencing via DNA hypermethylation in breast cancer. In the 
present study, we identify signal transduction regulators among 
RSV-hypermethylated targets and investigate the functional role of RSV-mediated 
DNA hypermethylation in the regulation of Hedgehog and Wnt signaling. 
Non-invasive ER-positive MCF-7 and highly invasive triple-negative MCF10CA1a 
human breast cancer cell lines were used as experimental models. Upon 9-day 
exposure to 15 µM RSV, pyrosequencing and qRT-PCR were performed to assess DNA 
methylation and expression of GLI2 and WNT4, which are upstream regulators of 
the Hedgehog and Wnt pathways, respectively. Our results showed that RSV led to 
a DNA methylation increase within GLI2 and WNT4 enhancers, which was accompanied 
by decreases in gene expression. Consistently, we observed the downregulation of 
genes downstream of the Hedgehog and Wnt signaling, including common targets 
shared by both pathways, CCND1 and CYR61. Further analysis using chromatin 
immunoprecipitation identified increased H3K27 trimethylation and decreased H3K9 
and H3K27 acetylation, along with abolishing OCT1 transcription factor binding. 
Those changes indicate a transcriptionally silent chromatin state at GLI2 and 
WNT4 enhancers. The inhibition of the Wnt signal transduction was confirmed 
using a phospho-antibody array that demonstrated suppression of positive and 
stimulation of negative Wnt regulators. In conclusion, our results provide 
scientific evidence for dietary polyphenols as epigenetics-modulating agents 
that act to re-methylate and silence oncogenes, reducing the oncogenic signal 
transduction. Targeting such an action could be an effective strategy in breast 
cancer prevention and/or adjuvant therapy.

BACKGROUND: Clear cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC) is the frequently diagnosed 
histological life-threatening tumor subtype in the urinary system. Integrating 
multi-omics data is emerging as a tool to provide a comprehensive view of 
biology and disease for better therapeutic interventions.
METHOD: We have integrated freely available ccRCC data sets of genome-wide DNA 
methylome, transcriptome, and active histone modification marks, H3K27ac, 
H3K4me1, and H3K4me3 specific ChIP-seq data to screen genes with higher 
expression. Further, these genes were filtered based on their effect on survival 
upon alteration in expression.
RESULTS: The six multi-omics-based identified genes, RUNX1, MSC, ADA, TREML1, 
TGFA, and VWF, showed higher expression with enrichment of active histone marks 
and hypomethylated CpG in ccRCC. In continuation, the identified genes were 
validated by an independent dataset and showed a correlation with nodal and 
metastatic status. Furthermore, gene ontology and pathway analysis revealed that 
immune-related pathways are activated in ccRCC patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The network analysis of six overexpressed genes suggests their 
potential role in an immunosuppressive environment, leading to tumor progression 
and poor prognosis. Our study shows that the multi-omics approach helps unravel 
complex biology for patient subtyping and proposes combination strategies with 
epi-drugs for more precise immunotherapy in ccRCC.

Through its involvement in gene transcription and heterochromatin formation, DNA 
methylation regulates how cells interact with their environment. Nevertheless, 
the extracellular signaling cues that modulate the distribution of this central 
chromatin modification are largely unclear. DNA methylation is highly abundant 
at repetitive elements, but its investigation in live cells has been complicated 
by methodological challenges. Utilizing a CRISPR/dCas9 biosensor that reads DNA 
methylation of human α-satellite repeats in live cells, we here uncover a 
signaling pathway linking the chromatin and transcriptional state of repetitive 
elements to epithelial adherens junction integrity. Specifically, we find that 
in confluent breast epithelial cell monolayers, α-satellite repeat methylation 
is reduced by comparison to low density cultures. This is coupled with increased 
transcriptional activity at repeats. Through comprehensive perturbation 
experiments, we identify the junctional protein E-cadherin, which links to the 
actin cytoskeleton, as a central molecular player for signal relay into the 
nucleus. Furthermore, we find that this pathway is impaired in cancer cells that 
lack E-cadherin and are not contact-inhibited. This suggests that the molecular 
connection between cell density and repetitive element methylation could play a 
role in the maintenance of epithelial tissue homeostasis.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is characterised by increases in prostate 
volume and contraction. Downregulation of the nitric oxide (NO)-cyclic guanosine 
monophosphate (cGMP) signalling pathway contributes to prostate dysfunctions. 
Previous studies in cancer cells or vessels have shown that the epigenetic 
mechanisms control the gene and protein expression of the enzymes involved in 
the production of NO and cGMP. This study is aimed to evaluate the effect of a 
2-week treatment of 5-azacytidine (5-AZA), a DNA-methyltransferase inhibitor, in 
the prostate function of mice fed with a high-fat diet. Functional, 
histological, biochemical and molecular assays were carried out. Obese mice 
presented greater prostate weight, α-actin expression and contractile response 
induced by the α-1adrenoceptors agonist. The relaxation induced by the NO-donor 
and the protein expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and 
soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) were significantly decreased in the prostate of 
obese mice. The treatment with 5-AZA reverted the higher expression of α-actin, 
reduced the hypercontractility state of the prostate and increased the 
expression of eNOS and sGC and intraprostatic levels of cGMP. When prostates 
from obese mice treated with 5-AZA were incubated in vitro with inhibitors of 
the NOS or sGC, the inhibitory effect of 5-AZA was reverted, therefore, showing 
the involvement of NO and cGMP. In conclusion, our study paves the way to 
develop or repurpose therapies that recover the expression of eNOS and sGC and, 
hence, to improve prostate function in BPH.

PURPOSE: Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) is thought to be the origin of myeloid 
neoplasms (MN). Yet, our understanding of the mechanisms driving CH progression 
to MN and clinical risk prediction of MN remains limited. The human proteome 
reflects complex interactions between genetic and epigenetic regulation of 
biological systems. We hypothesized that the plasma proteome might predict MN 
risk and inform our understanding of the mechanisms promoting MN development.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We jointly characterized CH and plasma proteomic profiles 
of 46,237 individuals in the UK Biobank at baseline study entry. During 500,036 
person-years of follow-up, 115 individuals developed MN. Cox proportional hazard 
regression was used to test for an association between plasma protein levels and 
MN risk.
RESULTS: We identified 115 proteins associated with MN risk, of which 30% (N = 
34) were also associated with CH. These were enriched for known regulators of 
the innate and adaptive immune system. Plasma proteomics improved the prediction 
of MN risk (AUC = 0.85; P = 5×10-9) beyond clinical factors and CH (AUC = 0.80). 
In an independent group (N = 381,485), we used inherited polygenic risk scores 
(PRS) for plasma protein levels to validate the relevance of these proteins 
toMNdevelopment. PRS analyses suggest that most MN-associated proteins we 
identified are not directly causally linked toMN risk, but rather represent 
downstream markers of pathways regulating the progression of CH to MN.
CONCLUSIONS: These data highlight the role of immune cell regulation in the 
progression of CH to MN and the promise of leveraging multi-omic 
characterization of CH to improveMN risk stratification. See related commentary 
by Bhalgat and Taylor, p. 3095.

BACKGROUND: Childhood cancer survivors are at high risk for morbidity and 
mortality and poor patient-reported outcomes, typically health-related quality 
of life (HRQOL). However, associations between DNA methylation-based aging 
biomarkers and HRQOL have not been evaluated.
METHODS: DNA methylation was generated with Infinium EPIC BeadChip on 
blood-derived DNA (median for age at blood draw = 34.5 years, range = 18.5-66.6 
years), and HRQOL was assessed with age at survey (mean = 32.3 years, range = 
18.4-64.5 years) from 2206 survivors in the St Jude Lifetime Cohort. DNA 
methylation-based aging biomarkers, including epigenetic age using multiple 
clocks (eg, GrimAge) and others (eg, DNAmB2M: beta-2-microglobulin; DNAmADM: 
adrenomedullin), were derived from the DNAm Age Calculator 
(https://dnamage.genetics.ucla.edu). HRQOL was assessed using the Medical 
Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey to capture 8 domains and 
physical and mental component summaries. General linear models evaluated 
associations between HRQOL and epigenetic age acceleration (EAA; eg, 
EAA_GrimAge) or other age-adjusted DNA methylation-based biomarkers (eg, 
ageadj_DNAmB2M) after adjusting for age at blood draw, sex, cancer treatments, 
and DNA methylation-based surrogate for smoking pack-years. All P values were 
2-sided.
RESULTS: Worse HRQOL was associated with greater EAA_GrimAge (physical component 
summaries: β = -0.18 years, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.251 to -0.11 
years; P = 1.85 × 10-5; and 4 individual HRQOL domains), followed by 
ageadj_DNAmB2M (physical component summaries: β = -0.08 years, 95% CI = -0.124 
to -0.037 years; P = .003; and 3 individual HRQOL domains) and ageadj_DNAmADM 
(physical component summaries: β = -0.082 years, 95% CI = -0.125 to -0.039 
years; P = .002; and 2 HRQOL domains). EAA_Hannum (Hannum clock) was not 
associated with any HRQOL.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall and domain-specific measures of HRQOL are associated with 
DNA methylation measures of biological aging. Future longitudinal studies should 
test biological aging as a potential mechanism underlying the association 
between poor HRQOL and increased risk of clinically assessed adverse health 
outcomes.

Gliomas are malignant tumours of the human nervous system with different World 
Health Organization (WHO) classifications, glioblastoma (GBM) with higher grade 
and are more malignant than lower-grade glioma (LGG). To dissect how the DNA 
methylation heterogeneity in gliomas is influenced by the complex cellular 
composition of the tumour immune microenvironment, we first compared the DNA 
methylation profiles of purified human immune cells and bulk glioma tissue, 
stratifying three tumour immune microenvironmental subtypes for GBM and LGG 
samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We found that more intermediate 
methylation sites were enriched in glioma tumour tissues, and used the 
Proportion of sites with Intermediate Methylation (PIM) to compare intertumoral 
DNA methylation heterogeneity. A larger PIM score reflected stronger DNA 
methylation heterogeneity. Enhanced DNA methylation heterogeneity was associated 
with stronger immune cell infiltration, better survival rates, and slower tumour 
progression in glioma patients. We then created a Cell-type-associated DNA 
Methylation Heterogeneity Contribution (CMHC) score to explore the impact of 
different immune cell types on heterogeneous CpG site (CpGct) in glioma tissues. 
We identified eight prognosis-related CpGct to construct a risk score: the 
Cell-type-associated DNA Methylation Heterogeneity Risk (CMHR) score. CMHR was 
positively correlated with cytotoxic T-lymphocyte infiltration (CTL), and showed 
better predictive performance for IDH status (AUC = 0.96) and glioma 
histological phenotype (AUC = 0.81). Furthermore, DNA methylation alterations of 
eight CpGct might be related to drug treatments of gliomas. In conclusion, we 
indicated that DNA methylation heterogeneity is associated with a complex tumour 
immune microenvironment, glioma phenotype, and patient's prognosis.

Benzo(a)pyrene as a pervasive environmental contaminant is characterized by its 
substantial genotoxicity, and epidemiological investigations have established a 
correlation between benzo(a)pyrene exposure and the susceptibility to human lung 
cancer. Notably, much research has focused on the link between epigenetic 
alterations and lung cancer induced by chemicals, although circRNAs are also 
emerging as relevant contributors to the carcinogenic process of benzo(a)pyrene. 
In this study, we identified circ_0067716 as being significantly upregulated in 
response to stress injury and downregulated during malignant transformation 
induced by benzo(a)pyrene-7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide (BPDE) in human bronchial 
epithelial cells. The observed differential expression of circ_0067716 in cells 
treated with BPDE for varying durations suggests a strong correlation between 
this circRNA and BPDE exposure. The tissue samples of lung cancer patients also 
suggest that a lower circ_0067716 expression is associated with BPDE-DNA adduct 
levels. Remarkably, we demonstrate that EIF4A3, located in the nucleus, 
interacts with the flanking sequences of circ_0067716 and inhibits its 
biogenesis. Conversely, circ_0067716 is capable of sequestering EIF4A3 in the 
cytoplasm, thereby preventing its translocation into the nucleus. EIF4A3 and 
circ_0067716 can form a double-negative feedback loop that could be affected by 
BPDE. During the initial phase of BPDE exposure, the expression of circ_0067716 
was increased in response to stress injury, resulting in cell apoptosis through 
the involvement of miR-324-5p/DRAM1/BAX axis. Subsequently, as cellular 
adaptation progressed, long-term induction due to BPDE exposure led to an 
elevated EIF4A3 and a reduced circ_0067716 expression, which facilitated the 
proliferation of cells by stabilizing the PI3K/AKT pathway. Thus, our current 
study describes the effects of circ_0067716 on the genotoxicity and 
carcinogenesis induced by benzo(a)pyrene and puts forwards to the possible 
regulatory mechanism on the occurrence of smoking-related lung cancer, providing 
a unique insight based on epigenetics.

Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is one of the most common subtypes of 
renal cancer, with 30% of patients presenting with systemic disease at 
diagnosis. This aggressiveness is a consequence of the activation of 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) caused by many different inducers or 
regulators, signaling cascades, epigenetic regulation, and the tumor 
environment. Alterations in EMT-related genes and transcription factors are 
associated with poor prognosis in ccRCC. EMT-related factors suppress E-cadherin 
expression and are associated with tumor progression, local invasion, and 
metastasis. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression levels and 
prognostic significance of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), 
β-catenin, and E-cadherin in ccRCC patients. We examined these proteins 
immunohistochemically in tumor areas and adjacent normal tissues resected from 
patients with ccRCC. Analysis of the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) cohort was 
performed to verify our results. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that median 
overall survival (OS) was significantly shorter in patients with tumors 
exhibiting high MIFn and MIFm-c levels compared to those with low MIFn and 
MIFm-c levels (p = 0.03 and p = 0.007, respectively). In the TCGA cohort, there 
was a significant correlation between MIF expression and OS (p < 0.0001). In 
conclusion, this study provides further evidence for the biological and 
prognostic value of MIF in the context of EMT as a potential early prognostic 
marker for advanced-stage ccRCC.

BACKGROUND: Aberrant DNA methylation is prevalent in colorectal serrated 
lesions. We previously reported that the CpG island of SMOC1 is frequently 
methylated in traditional serrated adenomas (TSAs) and colorectal cancers (CRCs) 
but is rarely methylated in sessile serrated lesions (SSLs). In the present 
study, we aimed to further characterize the expression of SMOC1 in early 
colorectal lesions.
METHODS: SMOC1 expression was analyzed immunohistochemically in a series of 
colorectal tumors (n = 199) and adjacent normal colonic tissues (n = 112).
RESULTS: SMOC1 was abundantly expressed in normal colon and SSLs while it was 
significantly downregulated in TSAs, advanced adenomas and cancers. Mean 
immunohistochemistry scores were as follows: normal colon, 24.2; hyperplastic 
polyp (HP), 18.9; SSL, 23.8; SSL with dysplasia (SSLD)/SSL with early invasive 
cancer (EIC), 15.8; TSA, 5.4; TSA with high grade dysplasia (HGD)/EIC, 4.7; 
non-advanced adenoma, 21.4; advanced adenoma, 11.9; EIC, 10.9. Higher levels 
SMOC1 expression correlated positively with proximal colon locations and flat 
tumoral morphology, reflecting its abundant expression in SSLs. Among TSAs that 
contained both flat and protruding components, levels of SMOC1 expression were 
significantly lower in the protruding components.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that reduced expression of SMOC1 is associated 
with progression of TSAs and conventional adenomas and that SMOC1 expression may 
be a biomarker for diagnosis of serrated lesions and risk prediction in 
colorectal tumors.

Among all types of renal cancer, clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the 
most common and lethal subtype and is associated with a high risk of metastasis 
and recurrence. Histone modifications regulate several biological processes that 
are fundamental to the development of cancer. Lysine methyltransferase 5C 
(KMT5C; also known as SUV420H2) is an epigenetic modifier responsible for the 
trimethylation of H4K20, which drives critical cellular events, including genome 
integrity, cell growth and epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT), in various 
types of cancer. However, the role of KMT5C in ccRCC remains unclear. As such, 
the expression and function of KMT5C in ccRCC were investigated in the present 
study. KMT5C expression was significantly increased in ccRCC tissues compared 
with normal tissues (P<0.0001), and it was closely associated with the overall 
survival rate of patients with ccRCC. By establishing ccRCC cell lines with 
KMT5C expression knockdown, the role of KMT5C in the maintenance of aerobic 
glycolysis in ccRCC cells via the regulation of several vital glycolytic genes 
was identified. Additionally, KMT5C promoted the proliferation and EMT of ccRCC 
cells by controlling crucial EMT transcriptional factors. Together, these data 
suggested that KMT5C may act as an oncoprotein, guide molecular diagnosis, and 
shed light on novel drug development and therapeutic strategies for patients 
with ccRCC.

Polymer-drug conjugates (PDCs) provide possibilities for the development of 
multiresponsive drug delivery and release platforms utilized in cancer therapy. 
The delivery of Temozolomide (TMZ, a DNA methylation agent) by PDCs has been 
developed to improve TMZ stability under physiological conditions for the 
treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM); however, with inefficient 
chemotherapeutic efficacy. In this work, we synthesized an amphiphilic triblock 
copolymer (P1-SNO) with four pendant functionalities, including (1) a TMZ 
intermediate (named MTIC) as a prodrug moiety, (2) a disulfide bond as a 
redox-responsive trigger to cage MTIC, (3) S-nitrosothiol as a 
light/heat-responsive donor of nitric oxide (NO), and (4) a poly(ethylene 
glycol) chain to enable self-assembly in aqueous media. P1-SNO was demonstrated 
to liberate MTIC in the presence of reduced glutathione and release gaseous NO 
upon exposure to light or heat. The in vitro results revealed a synergistic 
effect of released MTIC and NO on both TMZ-sensitive and TMZ-resistant GBM 
cells. The environment-responsive PDC system for codelivery of MTIC and NO is 
promising to overcome the efficacy issue in TMZ-based cancer therapy.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Cytologic and histopathologic diagnosis of non-ductal 
pancreatic neoplasms can be challenging in daily clinical practice, whereas it 
is crucial for therapy and prognosis. The cancer methylome is successfully used 
as a diagnostic tool in other cancer entities. Here, we investigate if 
methylation profiling can improve the diagnostic work-up of pancreatic 
neoplasms.
METHODS: DNA methylation data were obtained for 301 primary tumors spanning 6 
primary pancreatic neoplasms and 20 normal pancreas controls. Neural Network, 
Random Forest, and extreme gradient boosting machine learning models were 
trained to distinguish between tumor types. Methylation data of 29 nonpancreatic 
neoplasms (n = 3708) were used to develop an algorithm capable of detecting 
neoplasms of non-pancreatic origin.
RESULTS: After benchmarking 3 state-of-the-art machine learning models, the 
random forest model emerged as the best classifier with 96.9% accuracy. All 
classifications received a probability score reflecting the confidence of the 
prediction. Increasing the score threshold improved the random forest classifier 
performance up to 100% with 87% of samples with scores surpassing the cutoff. 
Using a logistic regression model, detection of nonpancreatic neoplasms achieved 
an area under the curve of >0.99. Analysis of biopsy specimens showed concordant 
classification with their paired resection sample.
CONCLUSIONS: Pancreatic neoplasms can be classified with high accuracy based on 
DNA methylation signatures. Additionally, non-pancreatic neoplasms are 
identified with near perfect precision. In summary, methylation profiling can 
serve as a valuable adjunct in the diagnosis of pancreatic neoplasms with 
minimal risk for misdiagnosis, even in the pre-operative setting.

Genomic instability, a hallmark of cancer, is a direct consequence of the 
inactivation of the tumor suppressor protein p53. Genetically modified mouse 
models and human tumor samples have revealed that p53 loss results in extensive 
chromosomal abnormalities, from copy number alterations to structural 
rearrangements. In this perspective article we explore the multifaceted 
relationship between p53, genomic stability, and epigenetic control, 
highlighting its significance in cancer biology. p53 emerges as a critical 
regulator of DNA repair mechanisms, influencing key components of repair 
pathways and directly participating in DNA repair processes. p53 role in genomic 
integrity however extends beyond its canonical functions. p53 influences also 
epigenetic landscape, where it modulates DNA methylation and histone 
modifications. This epigenetic control impacts the expression of genes involved 
in tumor suppression and oncogenesis. Notably, p53 ability to ensure cellular 
response to DNA demethylation contributes to the maintenance of genomic 
stability by preventing unscheduled transcription of repetitive non-coding 
genomic regions. This latter indicates a causative relationship between the 
control of epigenetic stability and the maintenance of genomic integrity in 
p53-mediated tumor suppression. Understanding these mechanisms offers promising 
avenues for innovative therapeutic strategies targeting epigenetic dysregulation 
in cancer and emphasizes the need for further research to unravel the 
complexities of this relationship. Ultimately, these insights hold the potential 
to transform cancer treatment and prevention strategies.

Uterine leiomyomas (fibroids) are the most common non-cancerous tumors affecting 
women. Psychosocial stress is associated with fibroid risk and severity. The 
relationship between psychosocial stress and fibroid pathogenesis may involve 
alterations in microRNAs (miRNAs) although this has yet to be examined. We 
investigated associations between two psychosocial stress measures, a composite 
measure of recent stressful life events and perceived social status, with 
expression levels of 401 miRNAs in myometrium (n = 20) and fibroids (n = 44; 20 
with paired fibroid and myometrium samples) among pre-menopausal women who 
underwent surgery for fibroid treatment. We used linear regressions to identify 
psychosocial stressors associated with miRNAs, adjusting for covariates (age, 
body mass index, race/ethnicity, and oral contraceptive use). The association 
between psychosocial stressors and miRNAs was considered statistically 
significant at an FDR p < 0.10 and showed a monotonic response (nominal 
p-trend < 0.05). In the myometrium, 21 miRNAs were significantly associated with 
a composite measure of recent stressful events, and two miRNAs were associated 
with perceived social status. No fibroid miRNAs were associated with either 
stress measure. Pathway analyses revealed miRNA-mRNA targets were significantly 
enriched (FDR p < 0.05) in pathways relevant to cancer/tumor development. Of the 
74 differentially expressed miRNAs between myometrium and fibroids, miR-27a-5p 
and miR-301b were also associated with stress exposure. Our pilot analysis 
suggests that psychosocial stress is associated with myometrial miRNA expression 
and, thus, may have a role in the pathogenesis of fibroids from healthy 
myometrium.

BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer (GC) is a frequent malignancy of the gastrointestinal 
tract. Exploring the potential anoikis mechanisms and pathways might facilitate 
GC research.
PURPOSE: The authors aim to determine the significance of anoikis-related genes 
(ARGs) in GC prognosis and explore the regulatory mechanisms in epigenetics.
METHODS: After describing the genetic and transcriptional alterations of ARGs, 
we searched differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from the cancer genome 
atlas and gene expression omnibus databases to identify major cancer marker 
pathways. The non-negative matrix factorisation algorithm, Lasso, and Cox 
regression analysis were used to construct a risk model, and we validated and 
assessed the nomogram. Based on multiple levels and online platforms, this 
research evaluated the regulatory relationship of ARGs with GC.
RESULTS: Overexpression of ARGs is associated with poor prognosis, which 
modulates immune signalling and promotes anti-anoikis. The consistency of the 
DEGs clustering with weighted gene co-expression network analysis results and 
the nomogram containing 10 variable genes improved the clinical applicability of 
ARGs. In anti-anoikis mode, cytology, histology, and epigenetics could 
facilitate the analysis of immunophenotypes, tumour immune microenvironment 
(TIME), and treatment prognosis.
CONCLUSION: A novel anoikis-related prognostic model for GC is constructed, and 
the significance of anoikis-related prognostic genes in the TIME and the 
metabolic pathways of tumours is initially explored.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cancer-related cause of 
death worldwide. Although Sorafenib is the standard systemic therapy for 
treating HCC, but it develops resistance very quickly, leading to poor 
prognosis. The current study was planned to explore the effect of l-methionine 
on the anticancer activity of Sorafenib in HCC. Ten millimolar of l-methionine 
treatment significantly reduced the IC50 of Sorafenib from 
5.513 ± 0.171 to 0.8095 ± 0.0465 µM in HepG2 cell line. It also resulted in 
concomitant increase in oxidative stress and deactivation of ERK/AMPK/AKT 
pathway. Additionally, it also resulted in the increased expression of dual 
specificity phosphatase 3 (DUSP3). In a rat model of sorafenib-resistant HCC 
induced by diethylnitrosamine (DEN) (100 mg/L/day) and Sorafenib 
(10 mg/kg), l-methionine (300 and 500 mg/kg/day) supplementation overcame the 
drug resistance, as indicated by the reduced formation of surface tumor 
nodules, prevention of cellular hypertrophy, hyperplasia and inflammation, and 
improved animal survival. Furthermore, l-methionine in combination with 
Sorafenib also inhibited AMPK/AKT and ERK pathway. At chromatin 
level, l-methionine supplementation prevented global methylation of H3K27me3, an 
inactivation mark, and demethylation of H3K36me2, an activation mark. 
Interestingly, our findings suggest that inhibition of the ERK pathway via 
increased activity of DUSP3 is epigenetically regulated. Besides, chromatin 
immunoprecipitation data exhibited augmented H3K36me2 (an activation mark) 
levels on the DUSP3 promoter region. To the best of our knowledge, we are the 
first to report that l-methionine supplementation improves the chemosensitivity 
in Sorafenib-resistant HCC via modulating the epigenetic landscape and can be a 
potential therapeutic strategy.

Phenotypic plasticity, defined as the ability of individual cells with stable 
genotypes to exert different phenotypes upon exposure to specific environmental 
cues, represent the quintessential hallmark of the cancer cell en route from the 
primary lesion to distant organ sites where metastatic colonization will occur. 
Phenotypic plasticity is driven by a broad spectrum of epigenetic mechanisms 
that allow for the reversibility of epithelial-to-mesenchymal and 
mesenchymal-to-epithelial transitions (EMT/MET). By taking advantage of the 
co-existence of epithelial and quasi-mesenchymal cells within immortalized 
cancer cell lines, we have analyzed the role of EMT-related gene isoforms in the 
regulation of epithelial mesenchymal plasticity (EMP) in high grade serous 
ovarian cancer. When compared with colon cancer, a distinct spectrum of 
downstream targets characterizes quasi-mesenchymal ovarian cancer cells, likely 
to reflect the different modalities of metastasis formation between these two 
types of malignancy, i.e. hematogenous in colon and transcoelomic in ovarian 
cancer. Moreover, upstream RNA-binding proteins differentially expressed between 
epithelial and quasi-mesenchymal subpopulations of ovarian cancer cells were 
identified that underlie differential regulation of EMT-related isoforms. In 
particular, the up- and down-regulation of RBM24 and ESRP1, respectively, 
represent a main regulator of EMT in ovarian cancer cells. To validate the 
functional and clinical relevance of our approach, we selected and functionally 
analyzed the Tropomyosin 1 gene (TPM1), encoding for a protein that specifies 
the functional characteristics of individual actin filaments in contractile 
cells, among the ovarian-specific downstream AS targets. The low-molecular 
weight Tpm1.8/9 isoforms are specifically expressed in patient-derived ascites 
and promote invasion through activation of EMT and Wnt signaling, together with 
a broad spectrum of inflammation-related pathways. Moreover, Tpm1.8/9 expression 
confers resistance to taxane- and platinum-based chemotherapy. Small molecule 
inhibitors that target the Tpm1 isoforms support targeting Tpm1.8/9 as 
therapeutic targets for the development of future tailor-made clinical 
interventions.

In old age, impaired immunity causes high susceptibility to infections and 
cancer, higher morbidity and mortality, and poorer vaccination efficiency. Many 
factors, such as genetics, diet, and lifestyle, impact aging. This study aimed 
to investigate how immune responses change with age in healthy Dutch and 
Tanzanian individuals and identify common metabolites associated with an aged 
immune profile. We performed untargeted metabolomics from plasma to identify 
age-associated metabolites, and we correlated their concentrations with ex-vivo 
cytokine production by immune cells, DNA methylation-based epigenetic aging, and 
telomere length. Innate immune responses were impacted differently by age in 
Dutch and Tanzanian cohorts. Age-related decline in steroid hormone precursors 
common in both populations was associated with higher systemic inflammation and 
lower cytokine responses. Hippurate and 2-phenylacetamide, commonly more 
abundant in older individuals, were negatively correlated with cytokine 
responses and telomere length and positively correlated with epigenetic aging. 
Lastly, we identified several metabolites that might contribute to the stronger 
decline in innate immunity with age in Tanzanians. The shared metabolomic 
signatures of the two cohorts suggest common mechanisms of immune aging, 
revealing metabolites with potential contributions. These findings also reflect 
genetic or environmental effects on circulating metabolites that modulate immune 
responses.

Cancers are diseases caused by genetic and non-genetic environmental factors. 
Epigenetic alterations, some attributed to non-genetic factors, can lead to 
cancer development. Epigenetic changes can occur in tumor suppressors or 
oncogenes, or they may contribute to global cell state changes, making cells 
abnormal. Recent advances in gene editing technology show potential for cancer 
treatment. Herein, we will discuss our current knowledge of epigenetic 
alterations occurring in cancer and epigenetic editing technologies that can be 
applied to developing therapeutic options.

IMPORTANCE: Changes in leukocyte composition often precede chronic disease 
onset. Patients with a history of breast cancer (hereinafter referred to as 
breast cancer survivors) are at increased risk for subsequent chronic diseases, 
but the long-term changes in peripheral leukocyte composition following a breast 
cancer diagnosis and treatment remain unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To examine longitudinal changes in peripheral leukocyte composition 
in women who did and did not develop breast cancer and identify whether 
differences in breast cancer survivors were associated with specific treatments.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this prospective cohort study, paired 
blood samples were collected from 2315 women enrolled in The Sister Study, a 
US-nationwide prospective cohort study of 50 884 women, at baseline (July 2003 
to March 2009) and follow-up (October 2013 to March 2015) home visits, with a 
mean (SD) follow-up interval of 7.6 (1.4) years. By design, approximately half 
of the included women had been diagnosed and treated for breast cancer after 
enrollment and before the second blood draw. A total of 410 women were included 
in the present study, including 185 breast cancer survivors and 225 who remained 
free of breast cancer over a comparable follow-up period. Data were analyzed 
from April 21 to September 9, 2022.
EXPOSURES: Breast cancer status and, among breast cancer survivors, cancer 
treatment type (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, endocrine therapy, or surgery).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Blood DNA methylation data were generated in 2019 
using a genome-wide methylation screening tool and deconvolved to estimate 
percentages of 12 circulating leukocyte subsets.
RESULTS: Of the 410 women included in the analysis, the mean (SD) age at 
enrollment was 56 (9) years. Compared with breast cancer-free women, breast 
cancer survivors had decreased percentages of circulating eosinophils (-0.45% 
[95% CI, -0.87% to -0.03%]; P = .03), total CD4+ helper T cells (-1.50% [95% CI, 
-2.56% to -0.44%]; P = .01), and memory B cells (-0.22% [95% CI, -0.34% to 
-0.09%]; P = .001) and increased percentages of circulating naive B cells (0.46% 
[95% CI, 0.17%-0.75%]; P = .002). In breast cancer survivor-only analyses, 
radiotherapy was associated with decreases in total CD4+ T cell levels, whereas 
chemotherapy was associated with increases in naive B cell levels. Surgery and 
endocrine therapy were not meaningfully associated with leukocyte changes.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study of 410 women, breast cancer 
survivors experienced lasting changes in peripheral leukocyte composition 
compared with women who remained free of breast cancer. These changes may be 
related to treatment with chemotherapy or radiotherapy and could influence 
future chronic disease risk.

PURPOSE: Risk stratification based on somatic mutations in TERT promoter and 
BRAF/RAS has been well established for papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), and there 
is emerging evidence showed that TERT promoter methylation was frequently 
observed in thyroid cancer patients with adverse features. This study was aimed 
to comprehensive explore the prognostic value of BRAF/RAS mutations, TERT 
promoter mutations, and TERT promoter methylation in PTC.
METHODS: The relationships of BRAF/RAS mutations, TERT promoter mutations, and 
TERT promoter methylation with clinical characteristics and outcomes of PTC were 
analyzed in 382 patients with PTC.
RESULTS: TERT promoter mutation and hypermethylation were collectively observed 
in 52 (13.6%) samples and associated with BRAF/RAS mutation, aggressive clinical 
characteristics, and poor clinical outcomes of PTC. Coexistence of BRAF/RAS and 
TERT alterations was found in 45 of 382 (11.8%) PTC patients and strongly 
associated with old patient age, extrathyroidal extension, advanced pathologic T 
stage and metastasis. Importantly, patients with both BRAF/RAS and TERT 
alterations had higher rates of tumor recurrence (13.6% vs 1.5%, P = 0.042) and 
disease progression (24.4% vs 3.3%, P < 0.001) than patients without any 
alterations, and cox regression analysis revealed that the coexistence of 
BRAF/RAS and TERT alterations, but not BRAF/RAS or TERT alterations alone, 
increased the risk of progression-free interval with an adjusted HR of 10.35 
(95% CI: 1.79-59.81, P = 0.009).
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggested that comprehensively analysis of BRAF/RAS 
mutations, TERT promoter mutation and methylation is an effective strategy to 
identify high-risk patients with PTC.

    Clin Epigenetics. 2024 Mar 18;16(1):43. doi: 10.1186/s13148-024-01654-6.

BACKGROUND: E-cadherin, a major actor of cell adhesion in the intestinal 
barrier, is encoded by the CDH1 gene associated with susceptibility to Crohn 
Disease (CD) and colorectal cancer. Since epigenetic mechanisms are suspected to 
contribute to the multifactorial pathogenesis of CD, we studied CpG methylation 
at the CDH1 locus. The methylation of the CpG island (CGI) and of the 1st 
enhancer, two critical regulatory positions, was quantified in surgical 
specimens of inflamed ileal mucosa and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
(PBMC) of 21 CD patients. Sixteen patients operated on for a non-inflammatory 
bowel disease, although not normal controls, provided a macroscopically normal 
ileal mucosa and PBMC for comparison.
RESULTS: In ileal mucosa, 19/21 (90%) CD patients vs 8/16 control patients (50%) 
(p < 0.01) had a methylated CDH1 promoter CGI. In PBMC, CD patients with 
methylated CGI were 11/21 (52%) vs 7/16 controls (44%), respectively. 
Methylation in the 1st enhancer of CDH1 was also higher in the CD group for each 
of the studied CpGs and for their average value (45 ± 17% in CD patients vs 
36 ± 17% in controls; p < 0.001). Again, methylation was comparable in PBMC. 
Methylation of CGI and 1st enhancer were not correlated in mucosa or PBMC.
CONCLUSIONS: Methylation of several CpGs at the CDH1 locus was increased in the 
inflamed ileal mucosa, not in the PBMC, of CD patients, suggesting the 
association of CDH1 methylation with ileal inflammation. Longitudinal studies 
will explore if this increased methylation is a risk marker for colorectal 
cancer.

BACKGROUND: Based on bioinformatics research of NUDT21 in pan-cancer, we aimed 
to clarify the mechanism of NUDT21 in HHNC by experiment.
METHODS: The correlation between differential expression of NUDT21 in pan-cancer 
and survival prognosis, genomic instability, tumor stemness, DNA repair, RNA 
methylation and with immune microenvironment were analyzed by the application of 
different pan-cancer analysis web databases. In addition, immunohistochemistry 
staining and genetic detection of NUDT21 in HHNCC tumor tissues by 
immunohistochemistry and qRT-PCR. Then, through in vitro cell experiments, 
NUDT21 was knocked down by lentivirus to detect the proliferation, cycle, 
apoptosis of FaDu and CNE-2Z cells, and finally by PathScan intracellular 
signaling array reagent to detect the apoptotic protein content.
RESULTS: Based on the pan-cancer analysis, we found that elevated expression of 
NUDT21 in most cancers was significantly correlated with TMB, MSI, neoantigens 
and chromosomal ploidy, and in epigenetics, elevated NUDT21 expression was 
strongly associated with genomic stability, mismatch repair genes, tumor 
stemness, and RNA methylation. Based on immunosuppressive score, we found that 
NUDT21 plays an essential role in the immunosuppressive environment by 
suppressing immune checkpointing effect in most cancers. In addition, using 
HHNSCC as a study target, PCR and pathological detection of NUDT21 in tumor 
tissues was significantly increased than that in paracancerous normal tissues. 
In vitro cellular assays, silencing NUDT21 inhibited proliferation and promoted 
apoptosis in FaDu and CNE-2Z cells, and blocked the cell cycle in the G2/M 
phase. Therefore, the experiments confirmed that NUDT21 promotes the 
proliferation of FaDu by suppressing the expression of apoptotic.

Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is a rare neoplasm known for its indolent 
clinical course, risk of perineural invasion, and late onset of distant 
metastasis. Due to the scarcity of samples and the tumor's rarity, progress in 
developing effective treatments has been historically limited. To tackle this 
issue, a high-throughput screening of epigenetic drugs was conducted to identify 
compounds capable of disrupting the invasive properties of the tumor and its 
cancer stem cells (CSCs). ACC cells were screened for changes in tumor 
viability, chromatin decondensation, Snail inhibition along tumor migration, and 
disruption of cancer stem cells. Seven compounds showed potential clinical 
interest, and further validation showed that Scriptaid emerged as a promising 
candidate for treating ACC invasion. Scriptaid demonstrated a favorable cellular 
toxicity index, effectively inhibited Snail expression, induced hyperacetylation 
of histone, reduced cell migration, and effectively disrupted tumorspheres. 
Additionally, LMK235 displayed encouraging results in four out of five 
validation assays, further highlighting its potential in combating tumor 
invasion in ACC. By targeting the invasive properties of the tumor and CSCs, 
Scriptaid and LMK235 hold promise as potential treatments for ACC, with the 
potential to improve patient outcomes and pave the way for further research in 
this critical area.

RATIONALE: Cancer of unknown primary (CUP) is a group of rare malignancies with 
poor prognosis and unidentifiable tissue-of-origin. Distinct DNA methylation 
patterns in different tissues and cancer types enable the identification of the 
tissue of origin in CUP patients, which could help risk assessment and guide 
site-directed therapy.
METHODS: Using genome-wide DNA methylation profile datasets from The Cancer 
Genome Atlas (TCGA) and machine learning methods, we developed a 200-CpG 
methylation feature classifier for CUP tissue of origin prediction (MFCUP). 
MFCUP was further validated with public-available methylation array data of 2977 
specimens and targeted methylation sequencing of 78 Formalin-fixed 
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples from a single center.
RESULTS: MFCUP achieved an accuracy of 97.2% in a validation cohort (n = 5923) 
representing 25 cancer types. When applied to an Infinium 450 K array dataset 
(n = 1052) and an Infinium EPIC (850 K) array dataset (n = 1925), MFCUP achieved 
an overall accuracy of 93.4% and 84.8%, respectively. Based on MFCUP, we 
established a targeted bisulfite sequencing panel and validated it with FFPE 
sections from 78 patients of 20 cancer types. This methylation sequencing panel 
correctly identified tissue of origin in 88.5% (69/78) of samples. We also found 
that the methylation levels of specific CpGs can distinguish one cancer type 
from others, indicating their potential as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and 
screening.
CONCLUSION: Our methylation-based cancer classifier and targeted methylation 
sequencing panel can predict tissue of origin in diverse cancer types with high 
accuracy.

DNA methylation regulators (DMRs) play a key role in DNA methylation, thus 
mediating tumor occurrence, metastasis, and immunomodulation. However, the 
effects of DMRs on clinical outcomes and immunotherapy response remain 
unexplored in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). In this study, eight LUAD cohorts and 
one immunotherapeutic cohort of lung cancer were utilized. We constructed a DNA 
methylation regulators-related signature (DMRRS) using univariate and 
multivariate COX regression analysis. The DMRRS-defined low-risk group was 
preferentially associated with favorable prognosis, tumor-inhibiting 
microenvironment, more sensitivity to several targeted therapy drugs, and better 
immune response. Afterward, the prognostic value and predictive potential in 
immunotherapy response were validated. Collectively, our findings uncovered that 
the DMRRS was closely associated with the tumor immune microenvironment and 
could effectively predict the clinical outcome and immune response of LUAD 
patients.

BACKGROUND: Low-dose Computed Tomography (CT) is used for the detection of 
pulmonary nodules, but the ambiguous risk evaluation causes overdiagnosis. Here, 
we explored the significance of the DNA methylation of 7 genes including TAC1, 
CDO1, HOXA9, ZFP42, SOX17, RASSF1A and SHOX2 in the blood cfDNA samples in 
distinguishing lung cancer from benign nodules and healthy individuals.
METHOD: A total of 149 lung cancer patients [72 mass and 77 ground-glass nodules 
(GGNs)], 5 benign and 48 healthy individuals were tested and analyzed in this 
study. The lasso-logistic regression model was built for distinguishing cancer 
and control/healthy individuals or IA lung cancer and non-IA lung cancer cases.
RESULTS: The positive rates of methylation of 7 genes were higher in the cancer 
group as compared with the healthy group. We constructed a model using age, sex 
and the ΔCt value of 7 gene methylation to distinguish lung cancer from benign 
and healthy individuals. The sensitivity, specificity and AUC (area under the 
curve) were 86.7%, 81.4% and 0.891, respectively. Also, we assessed the 
significance of 7 gene methylation together with patients' age and sex in 
distinguishing of GGNs type from the mass type. The sensitivity, specificity and 
AUC were 77.1%, 65.8% and 0.753, respectively. Furthermore, the methylation 
positive rates of CDO1 and SHOX2 were different between I-IV stages of lung 
cancer. Specifically, the positive rate of CDO1 methylation was higher in the 
non-IA group as compared with the IA group.
CONCLUSION: Collectively, this study reveals that the methylation of 7 genes has 
a big significance in the diagnosis of lung cancer with high sensitivity and 
specificity. Also, the 7 genes present with certain significance in 
distinguishing the GGN type lung cancer, as well as different stages.

Increasing environmental genotoxic chemicals have been shown to induce 
epigenetic alterations. However, the interaction between genetics and 
epigenetics in chemical carcinogenesis is still not fully understood. Here, we 
constructed an in vitro human lung carcinogenesis model (16HBE-T) by treating 
human bronchial epithelial cells with a typical significant carcinogen 
benzo(a)pyrene (BaP). We identified a novel circular RNA, circ0087385, which was 
overexpressed in 16HBE-T and human lung cancer cell lines, as well as in lung 
cancer tissues and serum exosomes from lung cancer patients. The upregulated 
circ0087385 after exposure to BaP promoted DNA damage in the early stage of 
chemical carcinogenesis and affected the cell cycle, proliferation, and 
apoptosis of the malignantly transformed cells. Overexpression of circ0087385 
enhanced the expression of cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1), which is crucial for 
metabolically activating BaP. Interfering with circ0087385 or CYP1A1 reduced the 
levels of ultimate carcinogen benzo(a)pyrene diol epoxide (BPDE) and BPDE-DNA 
adducts. Interfering with CYP1A1 partially reversed the DNA damage induced by 
high expression of circ0087385, as well as decreased the level of BPDE and 
BPDE-DNA adducts. These findings provide novel insights into the interaction 
between epigenetics and genetics in chemical carcinogenesis which are crucial 
for understanding the epigenetic and genetic toxicity of chemicals.

Bladder cancer (BC) has shown a significant global health concern with distinct 
pathological, genetic, and epigenetic characteristics. Its prevalence is 
influenced by various risk factors, including age, gender, and genetic 
predisposition. This study investigates the association between BC and the 
Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) gene polymorphism rs369274325 in the Turkish population. 
Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood samples and genotyping of 
rs369274325 polymorphism in SIRT 1 was investigated in 200 individuals (in 100 
Turkish bladder cancer patients and 100 healthy individuals as the control 
group.) by real-time PCR. Demographic information, smoking and alcohol 
consumption status was analyzed by statistical analysis. Statistical analysis 
was performed by Pearson's Chi-square test. Smoking and alcohol consumption were 
significantly higher in BC patients compared to controls (p < 0.00018 and 
p < 0.0001, respectively). The genotypic distribution of SIRT1 rs369274325 did 
not show a significant difference between BC patients and controls (p = 0.5550). 
BC, influenced by genetic and environmental factors, has been linked to various 
gene mutations. SIRT1, involved in diverse physiological processes, is proposed 
to play a role in BC. However, our study did not find a significant association 
between SIRT1 rs369274325 polymorphism and BC in the Turkish population.

As a type of programmed cell death, anoikis resistance plays an essential role 
in tumor metastasis, allowing cancer cells to survive in the systemic 
circulation and as a key pathway for regulating critical biological processes. 
We conducted an exploratory analysis to improve risk stratification and optimize 
adjuvant treatment choices for patients with breast cancer, and identify 
multigene features in mRNA and lncRNA transcriptome profiles associated with 
anoikis. First, the variance selection method filters low information content 
genes in RNA sequence and then extracts the mRNA and lncRNA expression data base 
on annotation files. Then, the top ten key mRNAs are screened out through the 
PPI network. Pearson analysis has been employed to identify lncRNAs related to 
anoikis, and the prognosis-related lncRNAs are selected using Univariate Cox 
regression and machine learning. Finally, we identified a group of RNAs 
(including ten mRNAs and six lncRNAs) and integrated the expression data of 16 
genes to construct a risk-scoring system for BRCA prognosis and drug sensitivity 
analysis. The risk score's validity has been evaluated with the ROC curve, 
Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis and decision curve analysis (DCA). For the 
methylation data, we have obtained 169 anoikis-related prognostic methylation 
sites, integrated these sites with 16 RNA features and further used the deep 
learning model to evaluate and predict the survival risk of patients. The 
developed anoikis feature is demonstrated a consistency index (C-index) of 
0.778, indicating its potential to predict the survival probability of breast 
cancer patients using deep learning methods.

Cellular senescence is a pathophysiological process with multifaceted effects. 
It is involved in wound healing, aging and age-related diseases as well as 
cancer. On the one hand, senescence is considered as barrier against 
tumorigenesis by inducing an irreversible/prolonged cell cycle arrest. On the 
other hand, it may promote tumorigenesis when senescent cells accumulate genomic 
instability and bypass this cell cycle arrest. Interestingly, the bystander 
effects mediate the propagation of the genetic instability from senescent cells 
to their environment through the SASP (Senescence Associated Secretory 
Phenotype) including proinflammatory cytokines, proteases, growth factors and 
Reactive Oxygen Species 'ROS.' From several markers explored to detect senescent 
cells (β-galactosidase, p16, p21, p53, heterochromatin foci, DNA damage,…), ROS 
arouse particular interest because of their involvement at the chronic 
supraphysiological level, in the induction and maintain of DNA damage, 
inflammation, cell cycle disruption and epigenetic instability. In this context, 
the choice of methods to detect ROS in senescent cells is of particular interest 
and must take into account relevant parameters as well as the specificity for 
each species of ROS and the subcellular localization of ROS production. In this 
chapter, we introduce senescence and ROS, we briefly discuss the advantages and 
the shortcomings of methods routinely used to detect ROS. In addition, we 
describe the protocol to detect ROS at mitochondrial level (using the MitoSOX 
staining) in the BCPAP cell line (from human papillary thyroid carcinomas) 
expressing BRAFV600E oncogene known to trigger senescence.

Phyllodes tumours (PTs) are rare fibroepithelial lesions of the breast that are 
classified as benign, borderline, or malignant. As little is known about the 
molecular underpinnings of PTs, current diagnosis relies on histological 
examination. However, accurate classification is often difficult, particularly 
for distinguishing borderline from malignant PTs. Furthermore, PTs can be 
misdiagnosed as other tumour types with shared histological features, such as 
fibroadenoma and metaplastic breast cancers. As DNA methylation is a recognised 
hallmark of many cancers, we hypothesised that DNA methylation could provide 
novel biomarkers for diagnosis and tumour stratification in PTs, whilst also 
allowing insight into the molecular aetiology of this otherwise understudied 
tumour. We generated whole-genome methylation data using the Illumina EPIC 
microarray in a novel PT cohort (n = 33) and curated methylation microarray data 
from published datasets including PTs and other potentially histopathologically 
similar tumours (total n = 817 samples). Analyses revealed that PTs have a 
unique methylome compared to normal breast tissue and to potentially 
histopathologically similar tumours (metaplastic breast cancer, fibroadenoma and 
sarcomas), with PT-specific methylation changes enriched in gene sets involved 
in KRAS signalling and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Next, we identified 53 
differentially methylated regions (DMRs) (false discovery rate < 0.05) that 
specifically delineated malignant from non-malignant PTs. The top DMR in both 
discovery and validation cohorts was hypermethylation at the HSD17B8 CpG island 
promoter. Matched PT single-cell expression data showed that HSD17B8 had minimal 
expression in fibroblast (putative tumour) cells. Finally, we created a 
methylation classifier to distinguish PTs from metaplastic breast cancer 
samples, where we revealed a likely misdiagnosis for two TCGA metaplastic breast 
cancer samples. In conclusion, DNA methylation alterations are associated with 
PT histopathology and hold the potential to improve our understanding of PT 
molecular aetiology, diagnostics, and risk stratification. © 2024 The Authors.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) presents a significant global health burden, 
characterized by a heterogeneous molecular landscape and various genetic and 
epigenetic alterations. Programmed cell death (PCD) plays a critical role in 
CRC, offering potential targets for therapy by regulating cell elimination 
processes that can suppress tumor growth or trigger cancer cell resistance. 
Understanding the complex interplay between PCD mechanisms and CRC pathogenesis 
is crucial. This study aims to construct a PCD-related prognostic signature in 
CRC using machine learning integration, enhancing the precision of CRC prognosis 
prediction.
METHOD: We retrieved expression data and clinical information from the Cancer 
Genome Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets. Fifteen forms of PCD 
were identified, and corresponding gene sets were compiled. Machine learning 
algorithms, including Lasso, Ridge, Enet, StepCox, survivalSVM, CoxBoost, 
SuperPC, plsRcox, random survival forest (RSF), and gradient boosting machine, 
were integrated for model construction. The models were validated using six GEO 
datasets, and the programmed cell death score (PCDS) was established. Further, 
the model's effectiveness was compared with 109 transcriptome-based CRC 
prognostic models.
RESULT: Our integrated model successfully identified differentially expressed 
PCD-related genes and stratified CRC samples into four subtypes with distinct 
prognostic implications. The optimal combination of machine learning models, 
RSF + Ridge, showed superior performance compared with traditional methods. The 
PCDS effectively stratified patients into high-risk and low-risk groups, with 
significant survival differences. Further analysis revealed the prognostic 
relevance of immune cell types and pathways associated with CRC subtypes. The 
model also identified hub genes and drug sensitivities relevant to CRC 
prognosis.
CONCLUSION: The current study highlights the potential of integrating machine 
learning models to enhance the prediction of CRC prognosis. The developed 
prognostic signature, which is related to PCD, holds promise for personalized 
and effective therapeutic interventions in CRC.

BACKGROUND: Malignant mesothelioma is an aggressive cancer that often originates 
in the pleural and peritoneal mesothelium. Exposure to asbestos is a frequent 
cause. However, studies in rodents have shown that certain multiwalled carbon 
nanotubes (MWCNTs) can also induce malignant mesothelioma. The exact mechanisms 
are still unclear. To gain further insights into molecular pathways leading to 
carcinogenesis, we analyzed tumors in Wistar rats induced by intraperitoneal 
application of MWCNTs and amosite asbestos. Using transcriptomic and epigenetic 
approaches, we compared the tumors by inducer (MWCNTs or amosite asbestos) or by 
tumor type (sarcomatoid, epithelioid, or biphasic).
RESULTS: Genome-wide transcriptome datasets, whether grouped by inducer or tumor 
type, showed a high number of significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) 
relative to control peritoneal tissues. Bioinformatic evaluations using 
Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) revealed that while the transcriptome datasets 
shared commonalities, they also showed differences in DEGs, regulated canonical 
pathways, and affected molecular functions. In all datasets, among highly- 
scoring predicted canonical pathways were Phagosome Formation, IL8 Signaling, 
Integrin Signaling, RAC Signaling, and TREM1 Signaling. Top-scoring activated 
molecular functions included cell movement, invasion of cells, migration of 
cells, cell transformation, and metastasis. Notably, we found many genes 
associated with malignant mesothelioma in humans, which showed similar 
expression changes in the rat tumor transcriptome datasets. Furthermore, RT-qPCR 
revealed downregulation of Hrasls, Nr4a1, Fgfr4, and Ret or upregulation of Rnd3 
and Gadd45b in all or most of the 36 tumors analyzed. Bisulfite sequencing of 
Hrasls, Nr4a1, Fgfr4, and Ret revealed heterogeneity in DNA methylation of 
promoter regions. However, higher methylation percentages were observed in some 
tumors compared to control tissues. Lastly, global 5mC DNA, m6A RNA and 5mC RNA 
methylation levels were also higher in tumors than in control tissues.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings may help better understand how exposure to MWCNTs can 
lead to carcinogenesis. This information is valuable for risk assessment and in 
the development of safe-by-design strategies.

As one of the first identified oncogenic microRNAs, the precise details 
concerning the transcriptional regulation and function of microRNA-21 (miR-21) 
are still not completely established. The miR-21 gene is situated on chromosome 
17q23.2, positioned at the 3'-UTR of the gene that encodes vacuole membrane 
protein-1 (VMP1). In this current study, we presented evidence indicating that 
miR-21 possesses its own gene promoter, which can be found in the intron 10 of 
the VMP1 gene. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by global DNA sequencing 
(ChIP-seq) revealed the presence of a broad H3K4me3 peak spanning the entire 
gene body of the primary miR-21 and the existence of super-enhancer clusters in 
the close proximity to both the miR-21 gene promoter and the transcription 
termination site in arsenic (As3+)-induced cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) and 
human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). In non-transformed human 
bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B), As3+ treatment enhanced Nrf2 binding to 
both the host gene VMP1 of miR-21 and the miR-21 gene. Knockout of Nrf2 
inhibited both the basal and As3+-induced expressions of miR-21. Furthermore, 
the As3+-enhanced Nrf2 peaks in ChIP-seq fully overlap with these 
super-enhancers enriched with H3K4me1 and H3K27ac in the miR-21 gene, suggesting 
that Nrf2 may coordinate with other transcription factors through the 
super-enhancers to regulate the expression of miR-21 in cellular response to 
As3+. These findings demonstrate the unique genetic and epigenetic 
characteristics of miR-21 and may provide insights into understanding the novel 
mechanisms linking environmental As3+ exposure and human cancers.

BACKGROUND: American men of African ancestry (AA) have higher prostate cancer 
incidence and mortality rates compared with American men of European ancestry 
(EA). Differences in genetic susceptibility mechanisms may contribute to this 
disparity.
METHODS: To gain insights into the regulatory mechanisms of prostate cancer 
susceptibility variants, we tested the association between SNPs and DNA 
methylation (DNAm) at nearby CpG sites across the genome in benign and cancer 
prostate tissue from 74 AA and 74 EA men. Genome-wide SNP data (from benign 
tissue) and DNAm were generated using Illumina arrays.
RESULTS: Among AA men, we identified 6,298 and 2,641 cis-methylation QTLs 
(meQTL; FDR of 0.05) in benign and tumor tissue, respectively, with 6,960 and 
1,700 detected in EA men. We leveraged genome-wide association study (GWAS) 
summary statistics to identify previously reported prostate cancer GWAS signals 
likely to share a common causal variant with a detected meQTL. We identified 
nine GWAS-meQTL pairs with strong evidence of colocalization (four in EA benign, 
three in EA tumor, two in AA benign, and three in AA tumor). Among these 
colocalized GWAS-meQTL pairs, we identified colocalizing expression quantitative 
trait loci (eQTL) impacting four eGenes with known roles in tumorigenesis.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight epigenetic regulatory mechanisms by which 
prostate cancer-risk SNPs can modify local DNAm and/or gene expression in 
prostate tissue.
IMPACT: Overall, our findings showed general consistency in the meQTL landscape 
of AA and EA men, but meQTLs often differ by tissue type (normal vs. cancer). 
Ancestry-based linkage disequilibrium differences and lack of AA representation 
in GWAS decrease statistical power to detect colocalization for some regions.

BACKGROUND: The organochlorine dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) is banned 
worldwide owing to its negative health effects. It is exceptionally used as an 
insecticide for malaria control. Exposure occurs in regions where DDT is 
applied, as well as in the Arctic, where its endocrine disrupting metabolite, 
p, p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p, p'-DDE) accumulates in marine mammals 
and fish. DDT and p, p'-DDE exposures are linked to birth defects, infertility, 
cancer, and neurodevelopmental delays. Of particular concern is the potential of 
DDT use to impact the health of generations to come via the heritable sperm 
epigenome.
OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to assess the sperm epigenome in 
relation to p, p'-DDE serum levels between geographically diverse populations.
METHODS: In the Limpopo Province of South Africa, we recruited 247 VhaVenda 
South African men and selected 50 paired blood serum and semen samples, and 47 
Greenlandic Inuit blood and semen paired samples were selected from a total of 
193 samples from the biobank of the INUENDO cohort, an EU Fifth Framework 
Programme Research and Development project. Sample selection was based on 
obtaining a range of p, p'-DDE serum levels (mean = 870.734 ± 134.030 ng/mL). We 
assessed the sperm epigenome in relation to serum p, p'-DDE levels using 
MethylC-Capture-sequencing (MCC-seq) and chromatin immunoprecipitation followed 
by sequencing (ChIP-seq). We identified genomic regions with altered DNA 
methylation (DNAme) and differential enrichment of histone H3 lysine 4 
trimethylation (H3K4me3) in sperm.
RESULTS: Differences in DNAme and H3K4me3 enrichment were identified at 
transposable elements and regulatory regions involved in fertility, disease, 
development, and neurofunction. A subset of regions with sperm DNAme and H3K4me3 
that differed between exposure groups was predicted to persist in the 
preimplantation embryo and to be associated with embryonic gene expression.
DISCUSSION: These findings suggest that DDT and p, p'-DDE exposure impacts the 
sperm epigenome in a dose-response-like manner and may negatively impact the 
health of future generations through epigenetic mechanisms. Confounding factors, 
such as other environmental exposures, genetic diversity, and selection bias, 
cannot be ruled out. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP12013.

BACKGROUND: The phenomenon of field cancerization reflects the transition of 
normal cells into those predisposed to cancer. Assessing the scope and intensity 
of this process in the colon may support risk prediction and colorectal cancer 
prevention.
METHODS: The Swiss Epigenetic Colorectal Cancer Study (SWEPIC) study, 
encompassing 1111 participants for DNA methylation analysis and a subset of 84 
for RNA sequencing, was employed to detect field cancerization in individuals 
with adenomatous polyps (AP). Methylation variations were evaluated for their 
discriminative capability, including in external cohorts, genomic localization, 
clinical correlations, and associated RNA expression patterns.
RESULTS: Normal cecal tissue of individuals harboring an AP in the proximal 
colon manifested dysregulated DNA methylation compared to tissue from healthy 
individuals at 558 unique loci. Leveraging these adenoma-related differentially 
variable and methylated CpGs (aDVMCs), our classifier discerned between healthy 
and AP-adjacent tissues across SWEPIC datasets (cross-validated area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve [ROC AUC] = 0.63-0.81), including within 
age-stratified cohorts. This discriminative capacity was validated in 3 external 
sets, differentiating healthy from cancer-adjacent tissue (ROC AUC = 0.82-0.88). 
Notably, aDVMC dysregulation correlated with polyp multiplicity. More than 50% 
of aDVMCs were significantly associated with age. These aDVMCs were enriched in 
active regions of the genome (P < .001), and associated genes exhibited altered 
expression in AP-adjacent tissues.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings underscore the early onset of field cancerization in 
the right colon during the neoplastic transformation process. A more extensive 
validation of aDVMC dysregulation as a stratification tool could pave the way 
for enhanced surveillance approaches, especially given its linkage to adenoma 
emergence.

BACKGROUND: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for the vast majority of 
lung cancers. Early detection is crucial to reduce lung cancer-related 
mortality. Aberrant DNA methylation occurs early during carcinogenesis and can 
be detected in blood. It is essential to investigate the dysregulated blood 
methylation markers for early diagnosis of NSCLC.
METHODS: NSCLC-associated methylation gene folate receptor gamma (FOLR3) was 
selected from an Illumina 850K array analysis of peripheral blood samples. Mass 
spectrometry was used for validation in two independent case-control studies 
(validation I: n = 2548; validation II: n = 3866). Patients with lung squamous 
carcinoma (LUSC) or lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), normal controls (NCs) and benign 
pulmonary nodule (BPN) cases were included. FOLR3 methylations were compared 
among different populations. Their associations with NSCLC clinical features 
were investigated. Receiver operating characteristic analyses, Kruskal-Wallis 
test, Wilcoxon test, logistics regression analysis and nomogram analysis were 
performed.
RESULTS: Two CpG sites (CpG_1 and CpG_2) of FOLR3 was significantly lower 
methylated in NSCLC patients than NCs in the discovery round. In the two 
validations, both LUSC and LUAD patients presented significant FOLR3 
hypomethylations. LUSC patients were highlighted to have significantly lower 
methylation levels of CpG_1 and CpG_2 than BPN cases and LUAD patients. Both in 
the two validations, CpG_1 methylation and CpG_2 methylation could discriminate 
LUSC from NCs well, with areas under the curve (AUCs) of 0.818 and 0.832 in 
validation I, and 0.789 and 0.780 in validation II. They could also 
differentiate LUAD from NCs, but with lower efficiency. CpG_1 and CpG_2 
methylations could also discriminate LUSC from BPNs well individually in the two 
validations. With the combined dataset of two validations, the independent 
associations of age, gender, and FOLR3 methylation with LUSC and LUAD risk were 
shown and the age-gender-CpG_1 signature could discriminate LUSC and LUAD from 
NCs and BPNs, with higher efficiency for LUSC.
CONCLUSIONS: Blood-based FOLR3 hypomethylation was shown in LUSC and LUAD. FOLR3 
methylation heterogeneity between LUSC and LUAD highlighted its stronger 
associations with LUSC. FOLR3 methylation and the age-gender-CpG_1 signature 
might be novel diagnostic markers for the early detection of NSCLC, especially 
for LUSC.

BACKGROUND: Folate is the primary methyl donor and B vitamins are cofactors for 
one-carbon metabolism that maintain DNA integrity and epigenetic signatures 
implicated in carcinogenesis. Breast tissue is particularly susceptible to 
stimuli in early life. Only limited data are available on associations of 
one-carbon metabolism-related vitamin intake during youth and young adulthood 
with breast density, a strong risk factor for breast cancer.
METHODS: Over 18 years in the DISC and DISC06 Follow-up Study, diets of 182 
young women were assessed by three 24-hour recalls on five occasions at ages 8 
to 18 years and once at 25 to 29 years. Multivariable-adjusted linear 
mixed-effects regression was used to examine associations of intakes of 
one-carbon metabolism-related vitamins with MRI-measured percent dense breast 
volume (%DBV) and absolute dense breast volume (ADBV) at ages 25 to 29 years.
RESULTS: Folate intake in youth was inversely associated with %DBV (Ptrend = 
0.006) and ADBV (Ptrend = 0.02). These inverse associations were observed with 
intake during post-, though not premenarche. In contrast, premenarche vitamin B2 
intake was positively associated with ADBV (Ptrend < 0.001). Young adult folate 
and vitamin B6 intakes were inversely associated with %DBV (all Ptrend ≤ 0.04), 
whereas vitamins B6 and B12 were inversely associated with ADBV (all Ptrend ≤ 
0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: Among these DISC participants intakes of one-carbon 
metabolism-related vitamins were associated with breast density. Larger 
prospective studies among diverse populations are needed to replicate these 
findings.
IMPACT: Our results suggest the importance of one-carbon metabolism-related 
vitamin intakes early in life with development of breast density and thereby 
potentially breast cancer risk later in life.

Despite the rising incidence, currently, there are no early detection methods 
for HPV-driven HNC (HPV-HNC). Cervical cancer studies suggest that HPV DNA 
methylation changes can be used as a biomarker to discriminate cancer patients 
from HPV-infected individuals. As such, this study was designed to establish a 
protocol to evaluate DNA methylation changes in HPV late genes and long control 
region (LCR) in saliva samples of HPV-HNC patients and HPV-positive controls. 
Higher methylation levels were detected in HPV late genes (L1 and L2) in both 
tumour and saliva samples of HPV-HNC patients compared with HPV-positive 
controls. Moreover, methylation patterns between tumours and corresponding 
saliva samples were observed to have a strong correlation (Passing-Bablok 
regression analysis; τ = 0.7483, P < 0.0001). Considering the differences 
between HNC and controls in methylation levels in late genes, and considering 
primer amplification efficiencies, 13 CpG sites located at L1 and L2 genes were 
selected for further evaluation. A total of 18 HNC saliva samples and 10 control 
saliva samples were assessed for the methylation levels in the selected sites. 
From the CpG sites evaluated statistically significant differences were 
identified for CpG sites at L2-CpG 6 (P = 0.0004), L1-CpG 3 (P = 0.0144), L1-CpG 
2 (P = 0.0395) and L2-CpG 19 (P = 0.0455). Our pilot data indicate that higher 
levels of DNA methylation in HPV late genes are indicative of HPV-HNC risk, and 
it is a potential supplementary biomarker for salivary HPV detection-based 
HPV-HNC screening.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths 
worldwide, and emerging evidence suggests that the gut microbiota may play a 
role in its development and progression. In this study, the association between 
B. thetaiotaomicron, a gut microbiota species, and HCC recurrence, as well as 
patient clinical outcomes, was investigated. It was observed that B. 
thetaiotaomicron-derived acetic acid has the potential to modulate the 
polarization of pro-pro-inflammatory macrophagess, which promotes the function 
of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. The increased biosynthesis of fatty acids was 
implicated in the modulation of pro-inflammatory macrophages polarization by B. 
thetaiotaomicron-derived acetic acid. Furthermore, B. thetaiotaomicron-derived 
acetic acid was found to facilitate the transcription of ACC1, a key enzyme 
involved in fatty acid biosynthesis, through histone acetylation modification in 
the ACC1 promoter region. Curcumin, an acetylation modification inhibitor, 
significantly blocked the inhibitory effects of B. thetaiotaomicron and acetic 
acid on HCC tumor growth. These findings highlight the potential role of gut 
microbiota-derived acetic acid in HCC recurrence and patient clinical outcomes, 
and suggest a complex interplay between gut microbiota, immune modulation, fatty 
acid metabolism, and epigenetic regulation in the context of HCC development. 
Further research in this area may provide insights into novel strategies for HCC 
prevention and treatment by targeting the gut microbiota and its metabolites.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Colorectal cancer is the most common cancer in oncopathology, 
with an increasing incidence among the elderly during the last decade. Various 
genetic and environmental factors play important roles in the emergence of 
colorectal adenocarcinoma. Non-coding RNAs, approximately 20-22 nucleotides, are 
transcribed irregularly in many cancer cells and play a critical role in many 
metabolic pathways in clinical cancer cases. DNA methylation is a critical 
epigenetic alteration that controls gene expression. In the current study, 
transcriptional silencing and CpG hypermethylation were developed as a 
therapeutic gene editing strategy for the clinical repression of colorectal 
adenocarcinoma.
METHODS: A human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line (Caco2) and a normal lung 
fibroblast cell line (Wi38) were utilized as the paradigms in this research to 
examine the effect of mir155 molecule transfection and CpGs-island (CGI) 
methylation. Cell counting was achieved using six-well and 24-well plates before 
transfection using a hemocytometer. The two cell lines were transfected with the 
mir155 agomir and antagomir molecules. The transfection efficiency, cell 
viability, cell IC50, and target gene expression were measured, and 
CGIs-methylation was achieved by bisulfate conversion.
RESULTS: The outcomes revealed the downregulation of oncogenes (AKT1 and VCAM1 
genes as cancer-associated genes) and the upregulation of tumor suppressor genes 
(TSGs, Tp53 and KEAP1). In addition, CpG-islands methylation showed significant 
blocking of the oncogene promoter regions, and the switch on of TSG promoter 
regions was continuous.
CONCLUSIONS: miRNA-CGI-methylation led to the regression of Caco2 cell 
proliferation, suggesting the potential use of RNA silencing and DNA methylation 
in targeted gene therapy for colorectal cancer.

Epidemiologic studies have reported the positive relationship of benzo[a]pyrene 
(BaP) exposure with the risk of lung cancer. However, the mechanisms underlying 
the relationship is still unclear. Plasma microRNA (miRNA) is a typical 
epigenetic biomarker that was linked to environment exposure and lung cancer 
development. We aimed to reveal the mediation effect of plasma miRNAs on 
BaP-related lung cancer. We designed a lung cancer case-control study including 
136 lung cancer patients and 136 controls, and measured the adducts of 
benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide-albumin (BPDE-Alb) and sequenced miRNA profiles in 
plasma. The relationships between BPDE-Alb adducts, normalized miRNA levels and 
the risk of lung cancer were assessed by linear regression models. The mediation 
effects of miRNAs on BaP-related lung cancer were investigated. A total of 190 
plasma miRNAs were significantly related to lung cancer status at Bonferroni 
adjusted P < 0.05, among which 57 miRNAs showed different levels with |fold 
change| > 2 between plasma samples before and after tumor resection surgery at 
Bonferroni adjusted P < 0.05. Especially, among the 57 lung cancer-associated 
miRNAs, BPDE-Alb adducts were significantly related to miR-17-3p, miR-20a-3p, 
miR-135a-5p, miR-374a-5p, miR-374b-5p, miR-423-5p and miR-664a-5p, which could 
in turn mediate a separate 42.2%, 33.0%, 57.5%, 36.4%, 48.8%, 32.5% and 38.2% of 
the relationship of BPDE-Alb adducts with the risk of lung cancer. Our results 
provide non-invasion biomarker candidates for lung cancer, and highlight miRNAs 
dysregulation as a potential intermediate mechanism by which BaP exposure lead 
to lung tumorigenesis.

The extent to which non-genetic environmental factors, such as diet, contribute 
to carcinogenesis has been long debated. One potential mechanism for the effects 
of environmental factors is through epigenetic modifications that affect gene 
expression without changing the underlying DNA sequence. However, the functional 
cooperation between dietary factors and cancer-causing epigenetic regulation is 
largely unknown. Here, we use a mouse model of age-dependent p16 epimutation, in 
which the p16 gene activity is directly controlled by promoter DNA methylation. 
We show p16 epimutation is modulated by folate and cofactors in dietary 
supplementation, which leads to increased colon cancer risk. Importantly, our 
findings provide functional evidence concerning the safety of folate 
fortification in the general population.
SIGNIFICANCE: Our study demonstrates that dietary folate and cofactors modulate 
tumor-suppressor gene methylation to increase intestinal tumorigenesis. Our 
findings highlight the need for monitoring the long-term safety of folate 
fortification in high-risk individuals.

BACKGROUND: Intestinal metaplasia (IM) and intraepithelial neoplasia (IEN) are 
considered precursors of gastric cardia cancer (GCC). Here, we investigated the 
histopathologic and molecular profiles of precancerous gastric cardia lesions 
(PGCLs) and biomarkers for risk stratification of gastric cardia IM.
METHODS: We conducted a hospital-based evaluation (n = 4578) for PGCL profiles 
in high-incidence and non-high-incidence regions for GCC in China. We next 
performed 850K methylation arrays (n = 42) and RNA-seq (n = 44) in tissues with 
PGCLs. We then examined the protein expression of candidate biomarker using 
immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: Of the 4578 participants, 791 were diagnosed with PGCLs (600 IM, 62 IM 
with IEN, and 129 IEN). We found that individuals from high-incidence regions 
(26.7%) were more likely to develop PGCLs than those from non-high-incidence 
areas (13.5%). DNA methylation and gene expression alterations, indicated by 
differentially methylated probes (DMPs) and differentially expressed genes 
(DEGs), exhibited a progressive increase from type I IM (DMP = 210, DEG = 24), 
type II IM (DMP = 3402, DEG = 129), to type III IM (DMP = 3735, DEG = 328), 
peaking in IEN (DMP = 47 373, DEG = 2278). Three DEGs with aberrant promoter 
methylation were identified, shared exclusively by type III IM and IEN. Of these 
DEGs, we found that OLFM4 expression appears in IMs and increases remarkably in 
IENs (P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: We highlight that type III IM and IEN share similar epigenetic and 
transcriptional features in gastric cardia and propose biomarkers with potential 
utility in risk prediction.

Diagnosing urothelial cancer (UCa) via invasive cystoscopy is painful, 
specifically in men, and can cause infection and bleeding. Because the UCa risk 
is higher for male patients, urinary non-invasive UCa biomarkers are highly 
desired to stratify men for invasive cystoscopy. We previously identified 
multiple DNA methylation sites in urine samples that detect UCa with a high 
sensitivity and specificity in men. Here, we identified the most relevant 
markers by employing multiple statistical approaches and machine learning 
(random forest, boosted trees, LASSO) using a dataset of 251 male UCa patients 
and 111 controls. Three CpG sites located in ALOX5, TRPS1 and an intergenic 
region on chromosome 16 have been concordantly selected by all approaches, and 
their combination in a single decision matrix for clinical use was tested based 
on their respective thresholds of the individual CpGs. The combination of ALOX5 
and TRPS1 yielded the best overall sensitivity (61%) at a pre-set specificity of 
95%. This combination exceeded both the diagnostic performance of the most 
sensitive bioinformatic approach and that of the best single CpG. In summary, we 
showed that overlap analysis of multiple statistical approaches identifies the 
most reliable biomarkers for UCa in a male collective. The results may assist in 
stratifying men for cystoscopy.

Neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) typically implies severe lethality and 
limited treatment options. The precise identification of NEPC cells holds 
paramount significance for both research and clinical applications, yet valid 
NEPC biomarker remains to be defined. Methods: Leveraging 11 published 
NE-related gene sets, 11 single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) cohorts, 15 bulk 
transcriptomic cohorts, and 13 experimental models of prostate cancer (PCa), we 
employed multiple advanced algorithms to construct and validate a robust NEPC 
risk prediction model. Results: Through the compilation of a comprehensive 
scRNA-seq reference atlas (comprising a total of 210,879 single cells, including 
66 tumor samples) from 9 multicenter datasets of PCa, we observed inconsistent 
and inefficient performance among the 11 published NE gene sets. Therefore, we 
developed an integrative analysis pipeline, identifying 762 high-quality NE 
markers. Subsequently, we derived the NE cell-intrinsic gene signature, and 
developed an R package named NEPAL, to predict NEPC risk scores. By applying to 
multiple independent validation datasets, NEPAL consistently and accurately 
assigned NE feature and delineated PCa progression. Intriguingly, NEPAL 
demonstrated predictive capabilities for prognosis and therapy responsiveness, 
as well as the identification of potential epigenetic drivers of NEPC. 
Conclusion: The present study furnishes a valuable tool for the identification 
of NEPC and the monitoring of PCa progression through transcriptomic profiles 
obtained from both bulk and single-cell sources.

Osteosarcoma is generally considered a cold tumor and is characterized by 
epigenetic alterations. Although tumor cells are surrounded by many immune cells 
such as macrophages, T cells may be suppressed, be inactivated, or not be 
presented due to various mechanisms, which usually results in poor prognosis and 
insensitivity to immunotherapy. Immunotherapy is considered a promising 
anti-cancer therapy in osteosarcoma but requires more research, but osteosarcoma 
does not currently respond well to this therapy. The cancer immunity cycle (CIC) 
is essential for anti-tumor immunity, and is epigenetically regulated. 
Therefore, it is possible to modulate the immune microenvironment of 
osteosarcoma by targeting epigenetic factors. In this study, we explored the 
correlation between epigenetic modulation and CIC in osteosarcoma through 
bioinformatic methods. Based on the RNA data from TARGET and GSE21257 cohorts, 
we identified epigenetic related subtypes by NMF clustering and constructed a 
clinical prognostic model by the LASSO algorithm. ESTIMATE, Cibersort, and xCell 
algorithms were applied to analyze the tumor microenvironment. Based on eight 
epigenetic biomarkers (SFMBT2, SP140, CBX5, HMGN2, SMARCA4, PSIP1, ACTR6, and 
CHD2), two subtypes were identified, and they are mainly distinguished by immune 
response and cell cycle regulation. After excluding ACTR6 by LASSO regression, 
the prognostic model was established and it exhibited good predictive efficacy. 
The risk score showed a strong correlation with the tumor microenvironment, drug 
sensitivity and many immune checkpoints. In summary, our study sheds a new light 
on the CIC-related epigenetic modulation mechanism of osteosarcoma and helps 
search for potential drugs for osteosarcoma treatment.

The multi-target stool DNA (mt-sDNA) test screens for colorectal cancer by 
analyzing DNA methylation/mutation and hemoglobin markers to algorithmically 
derive a qualitative result. A new panel of highly discriminant candidate 
methylated DNA markers (MDM) was recently developed. Performance of the novel 
MDM panel, with hemoglobin, was evaluated in a simulated screening population 
using archived stool samples weighted to early-stage colorectal cancer and 
prospectively collected advanced precancerous lesions (APL). Marker selection 
study (MSS) and separate preliminary independent verification studies (VS) were 
conducted utilizing samples from multi-center, case-control studies. Sample 
processing included targeted MDM capture, bisulfite conversion, and MDM 
quantitation. Fecal hemoglobin was quantified using ELISA. Samples were 
stratified into 75%/25% training-testing sets; model outcomes were 
cross-validated 1,000 times. All laboratory operators were blinded. The MSS 
included 232 cases (120 colorectal cancer/112 APLs) and 490 controls. The VS 
featured 210 cases (112 colorectal cancer/98 APLs) and 567 controls; APLs were 
86.7% adenomas and 13.3% sessile serrated lesions (SSL). Average age was 65.5 
(cases) and 63.2 (controls) years. Mean sensitivity in the VS from 
cross-validation was 95.2% for colorectal cancer and 57.2% for APLs, with 
specificities of 89.8% (no CRC/APLs) and 92.4% (no neoplasia). Subgroup analyses 
showed colorectal cancer sensitivities of 93.4% (stage I) and 94.2% (stage II). 
APL sensitivity was 82.9% for high-grade dysplasia, 73.4% for villous lesions, 
49.8% for tubular lesions, and 30.2% for SSLs. These data support high 
sensitivity and specificity for a next-generation mt-sDNA test panel. Further 
evaluation of assay performance will be characterized in a prospective, 
multi-center clinical validation study (NCT04144738).
PREVENTION RELEVANCE: This study highlights performance of the next-generation 
mt-sDNA test, which exhibits high sensitivity and specificity for detecting 
colorectal cancer and APLs. This noninvasive option has potential to increase 
screening participation and clinical outcomes. A multi-center, clinical 
validation trial is underway. See related commentary by Bresalier, p. 93.

Recent studies have shown that sessile serrated lesions (SSLs) lead to the 
development of colorectal cancer (CRC) with a microsatellite instability (MSI) 
phenotype via a dysplasia-carcinoma sequence. However, the pathological and 
molecular mechanisms of SSL with dysplasia (SSLD) are unclear. Here, we aimed to 
examine the clinicopathological and molecular alterations in SSLD and to 
evaluate the significance of such alterations with regard to lesion progression. 
Fifty-four SSLDs (20 serrated dysplasia cases and 17 intestinal dysplasia cases, 
including 30 low-grade dysplasia [LGD] cases, 7 high-grade dysplasia [HGD] 
cases, and 17 intramucosal adenocarcinomas [IMAs]) were evaluated. Molecular 
alterations, including immunohistochemical expression of various markers, DNA 
methylation status, and multiple genetic mutations (using next-generation 
sequencing), were assessed. Additionally, such alterations were also 
investigated in 41 CRCs with an MSI phenotype (invasion beyond submucosa). The 
frequency of mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency in SSLD was 12 of 39 cases 
(32.4 %), whereas the MMR proficient type was observed in 17 of 39 SSLD cases. 
SSLD with serrated dysplasia showed a significantly higher frequency of loss of 
MMR protein expression and methylation status. Moreover, loss of MMR protein 
expression differed significantly between LGD and IMA. Furthermore, the 
frequency of TP53 mutation was significantly higher in IMA than in LGD. The 
current findings demonstrated that SSL with serrated dysplasia may be associated 
with an increased risk of malignant transformation compared with intestinal 
dysplasia. Loss of MMR proteins and mutation of TP53 may play important roles in 
tumor progression from dysplasia to carcinomatous lesions.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the world's most common 
malignancies. Epigenetics is the study of heritable changes in characteristics 
beyond the DNA sequence. Epigenetic information is essential for maintaining 
specific expression patterns of genes and the normal development of individuals, 
and disorders of epigenetic modifications may alter the expression of oncogenes 
and tumor suppressor genes and affect the development of cancer. This study 
elucidates the relationship between epigenetics and the prognosis of CRC 
patients by developing a predictive model to explore the potential value of 
epigenetics in the treatment of CRC.
METHODS: Gene expression data of CRC patients' tumor tissue and controls were 
downloaded from GEO database. Combined with the 720 epigenetic-related genes 
(ERGs) downloaded from EpiFactors database, prognosis-related epigenetic genes 
were selected by univariate cox and LASSO analyses. The Kaplan-Meier and ROC 
curve were used to analyze the accuracy of the model. Data of 238 CRC samples 
with survival data downloaded from the GSE17538 were used for validation. 
Finally, the risk model is combined with the clinical characteristics of CRC 
patients to perform univariate and multivariate cox regression analysis to 
obtain independent risk factors and draw nomogram. Then we evaluated the 
accuracy of its prediction by calibration curves.
RESULTS: A total of 2906 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified 
between CRC and control samples. After overlapping DEGs with 720 ERGs, 56 
epigenetic-related DEGs (DEERGs) were identified. Combining univariate and LASSO 
regression analysis, the 8 epigenetic-related genes-based risk score model of 
CRC was established. The ROC curves and survival difference of high and low risk 
groups revealed the good performance of the risk score model based on prognostic 
biomarkers in both training and validation sets. A nomogram with good 
performance to predict the survival of CRC patients were established based on 
age, NM stage and risk score. The calibration curves showed that the prognostic 
model had good predictive performance.
CONCLUSION: In this study, an epigenetically relevant 8-gene signature was 
constructed that can effectively predict the prognosis of CRC patients and 
provide potential directions for targeted therapies for CRC.

BACKGROUND: The polygenic risk score (PRS) is used to predict the risk of 
developing common complex diseases or cancers using genetic markers. Although 
PRS is used in clinical practice to predict breast cancer risk, it is more 
accurate for Europeans than for non-Europeans because of the sample size of 
training genome-wide association studies (GWAS). To address this disparity, we 
constructed a PRS model for predicting the risk of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in 
the Korean population.
RESULTS: Using GWAS analysis, we identified 43 Korean-specific variants and 
calculated the PRS. Subsequent to plotting receiver operating characteristic 
(ROC) curves, we selected the 31 best-performing variants to construct an 
optimal PRS model. The resultant PRS model with 31 variants demonstrated a 
prediction rate of 77.4%. The pathway analysis indicated that the identified 
non-coding variants are involved in regulating the expression of genes related 
to cancer initiation and progression. Notably, favorable lifestyle habits, such 
as avoiding tobacco and alcohol, mitigated the risk of RCC across PRS strata 
expressing genetic risk.
CONCLUSION: A Korean-specific PRS model was established to predict the risk of 
RCC in the underrepresented Korean population. Our findings suggest that 
lifestyle-associated factors influencing RCC risk are associated with acquired 
risk factors indirectly through epigenetic modification, even among individuals 
in the higher PRS category.

Cancer cells release extracellular vesicles (EVs) that participate in altering 
the proximal tumor environment and distal tissues to promote cancer progression. 
Chronic exposure to nickel (Ni), a human group I carcinogen, results in 
epigenetic changes that promotes epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). 
Cells that undergo EMT demonstrate various molecular changes, including elevated 
levels of the mesenchymal cadherin N-cadherin (N-CAD) and the transcription 
factor Zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1). Moreover, the molecular 
changes following EMT induce changes in cellular behavior, including 
anchorage-independent growth, which contributes to cancer cells detaching from 
tumor bulk during the metastatic process. Here, we present data demonstrating 
that EVs from Ni-exposed cells induce EMT in recipient BEAS-2B cells in the 
absence of Ni. Moreover, we show evidence that the EVs from Ni-altered cells 
package the transcription factor nuclear protein 1 (NUPR1), a transcription 
factor associated with Ni exposure and cancer progression. Moreover, our data 
demonstrates that the NUPR1 in the EVs becomes part of the recipient cell 
proteomic milieu and carry the NUPR1 to the nuclear space of the recipient cell. 
Interestingly, knockdown of NUPR1 in Ni-transformed cells suppressed NUPR1 
packaging in the EVs, and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) demonstrated 
decreased EV release. Reduction of NUPR1 in EVs resulted in diminished EMT 
capacity that resulted in decreased anchorage independent growth. This study is 
the first to demonstrate the role of NUPR1 in extracellular vesicle-mediate 
cancer progression.

BACKGROUND: Smoking impacts DNA methylation, but data are lacking on 
smoking-related differential methylation by sex or dietary intake, recent 
smoking cessation (<1 year), persistence of differential methylation from in 
utero smoking exposure, and effects of environmental tobacco smoke (ETS).
METHODS: We meta-analysed data from up to 15,014 adults across 5 cohorts with 
DNA methylation measured in blood using Illumina's EPIC array for current 
smoking (2560 exposed), quit < 1 year (500 exposed), in utero (286 exposed), and 
ETS exposure (676 exposed). We also evaluated the interaction of current smoking 
with sex or diet (fibre, folate, and vitamin C).
FINDINGS: Using false discovery rate (FDR < 0.05), 65,857 CpGs were 
differentially methylated in relation to current smoking, 4025 with recent 
quitting, 594 with in utero exposure, and 6 with ETS. Most current smoking CpGs 
attenuated within a year of quitting. CpGs related to in utero exposure in 
adults were enriched for those previously observed in newborns. Differential 
methylation by current smoking at 4-71 CpGs may be modified by sex or dietary 
intake. Nearly half (35-50%) of differentially methylated CpGs on the 450 K 
array were associated with blood gene expression. Current smoking and in utero 
smoking CpGs implicated 3049 and 1067 druggable targets, including chemotherapy 
drugs.
INTERPRETATION: Many smoking-related methylation sites were identified with 
Illumina's EPIC array. Most signals revert to levels observed in never smokers 
within a year of cessation. Many in utero smoking CpGs persist into adulthood. 
Smoking-related druggable targets may provide insights into cancer treatment 
response and shared mechanisms across smoking-related diseases.

Glucose is a primary energy source for cancer cells. Several lines of evidence 
support the idea that monocarboxylate transporters, such as MCT1, elicit 
metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells in glucose-poor environments, allowing 
them to re-use lactate, a by-product of glucose metabolism, as an alternative 
energy source with serious consequences for disease progression. We employ a 
synergistic experimental and mathematical modelling approach to explore the 
evolutionary processes at the root of cancer cell adaptation to glucose 
deprivation, with particular focus on the mechanisms underlying the increase in 
MCT1 expression observed in glucose-deprived aggressive cancer cells. Data from 
in vitro experiments on breast cancer cells are used to inform and calibrate a 
mathematical model that comprises a partial integro-differential equation for 
the dynamics of a population of cancer cells structured by the level of MCT1 
expression. Analytical and numerical results of this model suggest that 
environment-induced changes in MCT1 expression mediated by lactate-associated 
signalling pathways enable a prompt adaptive response of glucose-deprived cancer 
cells, while fluctuations in MCT1 expression due to epigenetic changes create 
the substrate for environmental selection to act upon, speeding up the selective 
sweep underlying cancer cell adaptation to glucose deprivation, and may 
constitute a long-term bet-hedging mechanism.

Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most prevalent gynecological cancer in 
high-income countries. Its incidence is skyrocketing due to the increase in risk 
factors such as obesity, which represents a true pandemic. This study aimed to 
evaluate microRNA (miRNA) expression in obesity-related EC to identify potential 
associations between this specific cancer type and obesity. miRNA levels were 
analyzed in 84 EC patients stratified based on body mass index (BMI; ≥30 or <30) 
and nine noncancer women with obesity. The data were further tested in The 
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort, including 384 EC patients, 235 with BMI ≥30 
and 149 with BMI <30. Prediction of miRNA targets and analysis of their 
expression were also performed to identify the potential epigenetic networks 
involved in obesity modulation. In the EC cohort, BMI ≥30 was significantly 
associated with 11 deregulated miRNAs. The topmost deregulated miRNAs were first 
analyzed in 84 EC samples by single miRNA assay and then tested in the TCGA 
dataset. This independent validation provided further confirmation about the 
significant difference of three miRNAs (miR-199a-5p, miR-449a, miR-449b-5p) in 
normal-weight EC patients versus EC patients with obesity, resulting 
significantly higher expressed in the latter. Moreover, the three miRNAs were 
significantly correlated with grade, histological type, and overall survival. 
Analysis of their target genes revealed that these miRNAs may regulate 
obesity-related pathways. In conclusion, we identified specific miRNAs 
associated with BMI that are potentially involved in modulating obesity-related 
pathways and that may provide novel implications for the clinical management of 
obese EC patients.

BACKGROUND: The malignant childhood brain tumour, medulloblastoma, is classified 
clinically into molecular groups which guide therapy. DNA-methylation profiling 
is the current classification 'gold-standard', typically delivered 3-4 weeks 
post-surgery. Pre-surgery non-invasive diagnostics thus offer significant 
potential to improve early diagnosis and clinical management. Here, we determine 
tumour metabolite profiles of the four medulloblastoma groups, assess their 
diagnostic utility using tumour tissue and potential for non-invasive diagnosis 
using in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).
METHODS: Metabolite profiles were acquired by high-resolution magic-angle 
spinning NMR spectroscopy (MAS) from 86 medulloblastomas (from 59 male and 27 
female patients), previously classified by DNA-methylation array (WNT (n = 9), 
SHH (n = 22), Group3 (n = 21), Group4 (n = 34)); RNA-seq data was available for 
sixty. Unsupervised class-discovery was performed and a support vector machine 
(SVM) constructed to assess diagnostic performance. The SVM classifier was 
adapted to use only metabolites (n = 10) routinely quantified from in vivo MRS 
data, and re-tested. Glutamate was assessed as a predictor of overall survival.
FINDINGS: Group-specific metabolite profiles were identified; tumours clustered 
with good concordance to their reference molecular group (93%). GABA was only 
detected in WNT, taurine was low in SHH and lipids were high in Group3. The 
tissue-based metabolite SVM classifier had a cross-validated accuracy of 89% 
(100% for WNT) and, adapted to use metabolites routinely quantified in vivo, 
gave a combined classification accuracy of 90% for SHH, Group3 and Group4. 
Glutamate predicted survival after incorporating known risk-factors (HR = 3.39, 
95% CI 1.4-8.1, p = 0.025).
INTERPRETATION: Tissue metabolite profiles characterise medulloblastoma 
molecular groups. Their combination with machine learning can aid rapid 
diagnosis from tissue and potentially in vivo. Specific metabolites provide 
important information; GABA identifying WNT and glutamate conferring poor 
prognosis.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to explore the prognostic value of Septin9 DNA methylation 
in breast cancer.
METHODS: Breast cancer patients with and without recurrence or metastasis and 
matched non-breast cancer patients were screened retrospectively from 2014 to 
2016. Bisulfite conversion and fluorescence quantitative methylation-specific 
polymerase chain reaction were used to detect the Septin9 methylation status and 
distribution levels in patient breast tissues.
RESULTS: Septin9 DNA methylation was more frequent in breast cancer tissues than 
in non-breast cancer tissues, but was not significantly correlated with any 
relevant breast cancer patient clinicopathological characteristic. Septin9 
methylation rates were higher in patients with recurrence or metastasis. Septin9 
methylation, tumor size, lymph node status, and progesterone receptor (PR) 
expression could influence prognosis. Septin9 methylation was significantly 
associated with worse disease-free survival in breast cancer patients, with 
receiver operating characteristic curve analysis indicating that it had good 
prognostic ability, with an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.719. The AUC 
values increased when Septin9 methylation was combined with tumor size, lymph 
node status, and PR to predict prognosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Septin9 DNA methylation was an independent predictors of breast 
cancer prognostic risk. This could possibly help improve comprehensive prognosis 
prediction methods when combined with other risk factors.

As the representative item of environmental chemical carcinogen, MNNG was 
closely associated with the onset of Gastric cancer (GC), while the underlying 
mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we comprehensively analyzed the 
potential clinical significance of METTL3 in multiple GC patient cohorts. 
Additionally, we demonstrated that long-term exposure to MNNG elevated METTL3 
and EMT marker expression by in vitro and in vivo models. Furthermore, the 
depletion of METTL3 impacted the proliferation, migration, invasion, and 
tumorigenesis of MNNG malignant transformation cells and GC cells. By me-RIP 
sequencing, we identified a panel of vital miRNAs potentially regulated by 
METTL3 that aberrantly expressed in MNNG-induced GC cells. Mechanistically, we 
showed that METTL3 meditated miR-1184/TRPM2 axis by regulating the process of 
miRNA-118. Our results provide novel insights into critical epigenetic molecular 
events vital to MNNG-induced gastric carcinogenesis. These findings suggest the 
potential therapeutic targets of METTL3 for GC treatment.

BACKGROUND: Wilms tumor (WT) exhibits structural and epigenetic changes at 
chromosome 11p15, which also cause Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome (BWS). Children 
diagnosed with BWS have increased risk for WT. The aim of this study is to 
identify the molecular signaling signatures in BWS driving these tumors.
METHODS: We performed whole exome sequencing, methylation array analysis, and 
gene expression analysis on BWS-WT samples. Our data were compared to publicly 
available nonBWS data. We categorized WT from BWS and nonBWS patients by 
assessment of 11p15 methylation status and defined 5 groups- control kidney, 
BWS-nontumor kidney, BWS-WT, normal-11p15 nonBWS-WT, altered-11p15 nonBWS-WT.
RESULTS: BWS-WT samples showed single nucleotide variants in BCORL1, ASXL1, ATM 
and AXL but absence of recurrent gene mutations associated with sporadic WT. We 
defined a narrow methylation range stratifying nonBWS-WT samples. BWS-WT and 
altered-11p15 nonBWS-WT showed enrichment of common and unique molecular 
signatures based on global differential methylation and gene expression 
analysis. CTNNB1 overexpression and broad range of interactions were seen in the 
BWS-WT interactome study.
CONCLUSION: While WT predisposition in BWS is well-established, as are 11p15 
alterations in nonBWS-WT, this study focused on stratifying tumor genomics by 
11p15 status. Further investigation of our findings may identify novel 
therapeutic targets in WT oncogenesis.

PURPOSE: To our knowledge, there are very few studies evaluating if the levels 
of folate modify the risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 and 
higher (CIN2+ and CIN3+) associated with the levels of HPV genome methylation, 
two cofactors related to single carbon metabolism and independently associated 
with cervical cancer in previous studies. We conducted a case-control study 
nested in a three-arm randomized clinical pragmatic trial (ASCUS-COL trial) to 
evaluate the risk of CIN3+ associated with methylation levels according to serum 
folate concentrations.
METHODS: Cases (n = 155) were women with histologically confirmed CIN2+ (113 
CIN2, 38 CIN3, and 4 SCC) and controls were age and follow-up time at 
diagnosis-matched women with histologically confirmed ≤ CIN1 (n = 155), selected 
from the 1122 hrHPV + women of this trial. The concentrations of serum folate 
were determined by the radioimmunoassay SimulTRAC-SNB-VitaminB12/Folate-RIAKit 
and the methylation levels by the S5 classifier. Stepwise logistic regression 
models were used to estimate the association between folate or methylation 
levels and CIN2+ or CIN3+. The joint effect of folate levels and methylation on 
the risk of CIN3+ was estimated using combinations of categorical 
stratifications.
RESULTS: Folate levels were significantly lower in women with CIN3+ than in 
other diagnostic groups (p = 0.019). The risk of CIN3+ was eight times higher 
(OR 8.9, 95% CI 3.4-24.9) in women with folate deficiency and high methylation 
levels than in women with normal folate and high methylation levels (OR 1.4, 95% 
CI 0.4-4.6).
CONCLUSION: High methylation and deficient folate independently increased the 
risk of CIN3+ while deficient folate combined with high methylation was 
associated with a substantially elevated risk of CIN3+.

The clinical relevance of the colorectal cancer serrated pathway is evident, but 
the screening of serrated lesions remains challenging. We aimed to characterize 
the serum methylome of the serrated pathway and to evaluate circulating 
cell-free DNA (cfDNA) methylomes as a potential source of biomarkers for the 
non-invasive detection of serrated lesions. We collected serum samples from 
individuals with serrated adenocarcinoma (SAC), traditional serrated adenomas, 
sessile serrated lesions, hyperplastic polyps and individuals with no colorectal 
findings. First, we quantified cfDNA methylation with the MethylationEPIC array. 
Then, we compared the methylation profiles with tissue and serum datasets. 
Finally, we evaluated the utility of serum cfDNA methylation biomarkers. We 
identified a differential methylation profile able to distinguish high-risk 
serrated lesions from no serrated neoplasia, showing concordance with tissue 
methylation from SAC and sessile serrated lesions. Serum methylation profiles 
are pathway-specific, clearly separating serrated lesions from conventional 
adenomas. The combination of ninjurin 2 (NINJ2) and glutamate-rich 1 (ERICH1) 
methylation discriminated high-risk serrated lesions and SAC with 91.4% 
sensitivity (64.4% specificity), while zinc finger protein 718 (ZNF718) 
methylation reported 100% sensitivity for the detection of SAC (96% 
specificity). This is the first study exploring the serum methylome of serrated 
lesions. Differential methylation of cfDNA can be used for the non-invasive 
detection of colorectal serrated lesions.

SMARCA4 / BRG1 -deficient Uterine Neoplasm With Hybrid Adenosarcoma and 
Carcinoma Features: Expanding the Molecular-morphologic Spectrum of SMARCA4 
-driven Gynecologic Malignancies.

SMARCA4 gene encodes BRG1 , a member of the SWItch/sucrose non-fermentable 
protein family involved in epigenetic transcriptional regulation of important 
cellular processes. In the uterine corpus, SMARCA4 / BRG1 deficiency is 
associated with a novel class of undifferentiated uterine sarcomas, 
characterized by younger age onset, rhabdoid histology, focal phyllodiform 
architecture, high-risk pathologic findings, and dismal prognosis. Herein, we 
report a case of a 34-year-old Asian woman with a SMARCA4 / BRG1 -deficient 
uterine tumor fulfilling the clinicopathologic features of an undifferentiated 
uterine sarcoma. However, the tumor exhibited several unique features that have 
not been previously emphasized, including (1) conspicuous phyllodiform 
architecture recapitulating conventional adenosarcoma, (2) rhabdoid tumor cells 
forming cords and keratin-positive cohesive epithelial islands, and (3) 
cooccurrence with a spatially distinct and discrete endometrial complex atypical 
hyperplasia from the rest of the proliferation. By immunohistochemistry, the 
tumor cells were diffusely positive for synaptophysin, whereas BRG1 was lost. 
Pertinent molecular findings included frameshift mutations in the SMARCA4 gene, 
mutations in histone modification and chromatin remodeling genes, including 
KMT2C , ARID1B , KAT6A , and NCOR1 , and mutations in Wnt signaling involving 
APC and CTNNB1 . Copy number gain in MDM2 and CDK4 were also identified. The 
tumor mutation burden was intermediate (6.8/MB) and it was microsatellite 
stable. On balance, our case exhibited morphologic and molecular features that 
overlap with (1) an undifferentiated uterine sarcoma, (2) an adenosarcoma with 
sarcomatous overgrowth, and (3) a mixed adenosarcoma and undifferentiated 
endometrial carcinoma. These hybrid features further expand the 
molecular-morphologic spectrum of SMARCA4 / BRG1 -deficient uterine neoplasms.

Breast cancers (BC) are rare in men and are often caused by constitutional 
predisposing factors. In women, mosaic BRCA1 promoter methylations (MBPM) are 
frequent events, detected in 4-8% of healthy subjects. This constitutional 
epimutation increases risk of early-onset and triple-negative BC. However, the 
role of MBPM in male BC predisposition has never been assessed. We screened 40 
blood samples from men affected by BC, and performed extensive tumour analysis 
on MBPM-positive patients. We detected two patients carrying MBPM. Surprisingly, 
tumour analysis revealed that neither of these two male BCs were caused by the 
constitutional BRCA1 epimutations carried by the patients.

Epidemiological evidence of increased risks of cancer in heart failure (HF) 
patients and HF in cancer patients has suggested close relationships between the 
pathogenesis of both diseases. Indeed, HF and cancer share common risk factors, 
including aging and unhealthy lifestyles, and underlying mechanisms, including 
activation of the sympathetic nervous system and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone 
system, chronic inflammation, and clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate 
potential. Mechanistically, HF accelerates cancer development and progression 
via secreted factors, so-called cardiokines, and epigenetic remodeling of bone 
marrow cells into an immunosuppressive phenotype. Reciprocally, cancer promotes 
HF via cachexia-related wasting and metabolic remodeling in the heart, and 
possibly via cancer-derived extracellular vesicles influencing myocardial 
structure and function. The novel concept of the ""heart-cancer axis"" will help 
in our understanding of the shared and reciprocal relationships between HF and 
cancer, and provide innovative diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for both 
diseases.

OBJECTIVE: We aim to determine whether incremental changes in genetic ancestry 
percentages influence molecular and clinical outcome characteristics of breast 
cancer in an admixed population.
BACKGROUND: Patients with breast cancer are predominantly characterized as 
""Black"" or ""White"" based on self-identified race/ethnicity or arbitrary genetic 
ancestry cutoffs. This limits scientific discovery in populations that are 
admixed or of mixed race/ethnicity as they cannot be classified based on 
historical race/ethnicity boxes or genetic ancestry cutoffs.
METHODS: We used The Cancer Genome Atlas cohort and focused on genetically 
admixed patients that had less than 90% European, African, Asian, or Native 
American ancestry.
RESULTS: Genetically admixed patients with breast cancer exhibited improved 
10-year overall survival relative to those with >90% European ancestry. Within 
the luminal A subtype, patients with lower African ancestry had longer 10-year 
overall survival compared to those with higher African ancestry. The correlation 
of genetic ancestry with gene expression and DNA methylation in the admixed 
cohort revealed novel ancestry-specific intrinsic PAM50 subtype patterns. In 
luminal A tumors, genetic ancestry was correlated with both the expression and 
methylation of signaling genes, while in basal-like tumors, genetic ancestry was 
correlated with stemness genes. In addition, we took a machine-learning approach 
to estimate genetic ancestry from gene expression or DNA methylation and were 
able to accurately calculate ancestry values from a reduced set of 10 genes or 
50 methylation sites that were specific for each molecular subtype.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that incremental changes in genetic ancestry 
percentages result in ancestry-specific molecular differences even between 
well-established PAM50 subtypes which may influence disparities in breast cancer 
survival outcomes. Accounting for incremental changes in ancestry will be 
important in future research, prognostication, and risk stratification, 
particularly in ancestrally diverse populations.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Although immunotherapy shows substantial advancement in 
colorectal cancer (CRC) with microsatellite instability high, it has limited 
efficacy for CRC with microsatellite stability (MSS). Identifying combinations 
that reverse immune suppression and prime MSS tumors for current immunotherapy 
approaches remains an urgent need.
METHODS: An in vitro CRISPR screen was performed using coculture models of 
primary tumor cells and autologous immune cells from MSS CRC patients to 
identify epigenetic targets that could enhance immunotherapy efficacy in MSS 
tumors.
RESULTS: We revealed EHMT2, a histone methyltransferase, as a potential target 
for MSS CRC. EHMT2 inhibition transformed the immunosuppressive microenvironment 
of MSS tumors into an immunomodulatory one by altering cytokine expression, 
leading to T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity activation and improved responsiveness 
to anti-PD1 treatment. We observed galectin-7 up-regulation upon EHMT2 
inhibition, which converted a ""cold"" MSS tumor environment into a 
T-cell-inflamed one. Mechanistically, CHD4 repressed galectin-7 expression by 
recruiting EHMT2 to form a cotranscriptional silencing complex. Galectin-7 
administration enhanced anti-PD1 efficacy in MSS CRC, serving as a potent 
adjunct cytokine therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that targeting the EHMT2/galectin-7 axis could 
provide a novel combination strategy for immunotherapy in MSS CRC.

The role of epigenetic alteration in prostate cancer pathogenesis was reported. 
We aimed to analyze dysregulation of DNA methylase (DNA methyl transferase/DNMT) 
and demethylase (ten eleven translocase/TET) and the associated interplay 
between them during prostate tumorigenesis. Promoter methylation and RNA/protein 
expression of selected DNMT and TETs were analysed in normal prostate, benign 
prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and prostate cancer (PCa). Genomic 
5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) level was detected and correlated with DNMT and 
TET proteins. Clinicopathological association of molecular data was done. Our 
data revealed a very low frequency of promoter methylation for DNMT1 (5-3% and 
high frequency for TET1 (22-38%), TET2 (68-90 %), and TET3 (43-32 %) in BPH and 
PCa. The promoter methylation of DNMT1 (p = 0.019) showed a significantly 
decreasing trend, while that of TET1 (p = 0.0005) and TET2 (p < 0.0001) showed 
an increasing trend from normal prostate to BPH to PCa, indicating their 
epigenetic dysregulation during prostate tumorigenesis. RNA/protein 
overexpression of DNMT1 and reduced expression of TET1 and TET2 in PCa compared 
to BPH were associated with the promoter methylation status of genes. The 5hmC 
level was significantly lower in PCa than in BPH and correlated negatively with 
DNMT1 but positively with TET1 and TET2 proteins, suggesting dysregulation of 
DNA methylase and de-methylase activities during prostate tumorigenesis. Lastly, 
tumors having methylated TET1 and TET2 promoters showed advanced 
clinicopathological features (a higher PSA level/Gleason score) and increased 
risk of bone metastasis. In conclusion, DNMT1 upregulation and epigenetic 
silencing of TET1 and TET2 was seen during PCa development. TET1 and TET2 
promoter methylation has prognostic importance.

BACKGROUND: AHRR and F2RL3 hypomethylation has been associated with lung cancer. 
In this study, we investigated the cross-sectional association between smoking 
and occupational exposures, and AHRR and F2RL3 methylation.
METHODS: A case-control study was nested in CARTaGENE to examine the association 
between AHRR and F2RL3 methylation and lung cancer risk (200 cases; 400 
controls). A secondary analysis was conducted using the data collected from this 
nested study; namely, baseline information on participants' smoking behavior and 
longest-held job was obtained. A cumulative smoking index summarized information 
on the number of cigarettes smoked, duration of smoking, and time since 
cessation. Exposure to 13 occupational agents was estimated using the Canadian 
Job Exposure Matrix. In baseline blood samples, methylation ratios of 40 CpG 
sites in the AHRR and F2RL3 genes were measured using Sequenom EpiTYPER. 
Separate least squares regression models were used to estimate the associations 
between smoking and occupational exposures, and average AHRR and F2RL3 
methylation levels, while adjusting for confounders identified from directed 
acyclic graphs.
RESULTS: In both genes, smoking was associated with lower average methylation 
levels. Occupational exposure to aromatic amines, cadmium, and formaldehyde were 
associated with lower AHRR methylation while, only benzene was associated with 
F2RL3 hypomethylation; these associations were stronger among ever smokers.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support that smoking and occupational exposures to 
some agents are associated with AHRR and F2RL3 hypomethylation.
IMPACT: Our results inform on mechanisms underlying environmental exposures in 
lung cancer etiology; future studies should prioritize studying joint exposures.

N6 -methyladenosine (m6 A) modification has been identified as one of the most 
important epigenetic regulation mechanisms in the development of human cancers. 
However, the association between m6 A-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms 
(m6 A-SNPs) and lung cancer risk remains largely unknown. Here, we identified m6 
A-SNPs and examined the association of these m6 A-SNPs with lung cancer risk in 
13,793 lung cancer cases and 14,027 controls. In silico functional annotation 
was used to identify causal m6 A-SNPs and target genes. Furthermore, methylated 
RNA immunoprecipitation and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction 
(MeRIP-qPCR) assay was performed to assess the m6 A modification level of 
different genotypes of the causal SNP. In vitro assays were performed to 
validate the potential role of the target gene in lung cancer. A total of 8794 
m6 A-SNPs were detected, among which 397 SNPs in nine susceptibility loci were 
associated with lung cancer risk, including six novel loci. Bioinformatics 
analyses indicated that rs1321328 in 6q21 was located around the m6 A 
modification site of AK9 and significantly reduced AK9 expression (β = -0.15, 
p = 2.78 × 10-8 ). Moreover, AK9 was significantly downregulated in lung cancer 
tissues than that in adjacent normal tissues of samples from the Cancer Genome 
Atlas and Nanjing Lung Cancer Cohort. MeRIP-qPCR assay suggested that C allele 
of rs1321328 could significantly decrease the m6 A modification level of AK9 
compared with G allele. In vitro assays verified the tumor-suppressing role of 
AK9 in lung cancer. These findings shed light on the pathogenic mechanism of 
lung cancer susceptibility loci linked with m6 A modification.

Nickel (Ni) is a human carcinogen with genotoxic and epigenotoxic effects. 
Environmental and occupational exposure to Ni increases the risk of cancer and 
chronic inflammatory diseases. Our previous findings indicate that Ni alters 
gene expression through epigenetic regulation, specifically impacting E-cadherin 
and angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4), involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition 
and migration. GST-M2, a member of the glutathione S-transferase (GST) enzyme 
family, plays a crucial role in cellular defense against oxidative damage and 
has been increasingly associated with cancer. GST-M2 overexpression inhibits 
lung cancer invasion and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Hypermethylation of 
its promoter in cancer cells reduces gene expression, correlating with poor 
prognosis in non-small-cell lung cancer patients. The impact of Ni on GST-M2 
remains unclear. We will investigate whether nickel exerts regulatory effects on 
GST-M2 through epigenetic modifications. Additionally, metformin, an 
antidiabetic drug, is being studied as a chemopreventive agent against 
nickel-induced damage. Our findings indicate that nickel chloride (NiCl2 ) 
exposure, both short-term and long-term, represses GST-M2 expression. However, 
the expression can be restored by demethylation agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine and 
metformin. NiCl2 promotes hypermethylation of the GST-M2 promoter, as confirmed 
by methylation-specific PCR and bisulfite sequencing. Additionally, NiCl2 also 
influences histone acetylation, and metformin counteracts the suppressive effect 
of NiCl2 on histone H3 expression. Metformin reestablishes the binding of 
specificity protein 1 to the GST-M2 promoter, which is otherwise disrupted by 
NiCl2 . These findings elucidate the mechanism by which Ni reduces GST-M2 
expression and transcriptional activity, potentially contributing to Ni-induced 
lung carcinogenesis.

Arsenic is a relatively abundant metalloid that impacts DNA methylation and has 
been implicated in various adverse health outcomes including several cancers and 
diabetes. However, uncertainty remains about the identity of genomic CpGs that 
are sensitive to arsenic exposure, in utero or otherwise. Here we identified a 
high confidence set of CpG sites whose methylation is sensitive to in utero 
arsenic exposure. To do so, we analyzed methylation of infant CpGs as a function 
of maternal urinary arsenic in cord blood and placenta from geographically and 
ancestrally distinct human populations. Independent analyses of these distinct 
populations were followed by combination of results across sexes and 
populations/tissue types. Following these analyses, we concluded that both sex 
and tissue type are important drivers of heterogeneity in methylation response 
at several CpGs. We also identified 17 high confidence CpGs that were 
hypermethylated across sex, tissue type and population; 11 of these were located 
within protein coding genes. This pattern is consistent with hypotheses that 
arsenic increases cancer risk by inducing the hypermethylation of genic regions. 
This study represents an opportunity to understand consistent, reproducible 
patterns of epigenomic responses after in utero arsenic exposure and may aid 
towards novel biomarkers or signatures of arsenic exposure. Identifying 
arsenic-responsive sites can also contribute to our understanding of the 
biological mechanisms by which arsenic exposure can affect biological function 
and increase risk of cancer and other age-related diseases.

INTRODUCTION: Endometrial cancer (EC) is a prevalent malignancy affecting the 
female population, with an increasing incidence among younger age groups. DNA 
methylation, a common epigenetic modification, is well-established to play a key 
role in cancer progression. We suspected whether DNA methylation could be used 
as biomarkers for EC prognosis.
METHODS: In the present study, we analyzed bulk RNA-sequencing data from 544 EC 
patients and DNA methylation data from 430 EC patients in the TCGA-UCEC cohort. 
We applied weighted correlation network analysis to select a key gene set 
associated with panoptosis. We conducted correlation analysis between 
transcriptomic data of the selected key genes and DNA methylation data to 
identify valuable DNA methylation sites. These sites were further screened by 
Cox regression and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator analysis. 
Immune microenvironment differences between high-risk and low-risk groups were 
assessed using single-sample gene set enrichment analysi, xCell and MCPcounter 
algorithms.
RESULTS: Our results identified five DNA methylation sites (cg03906681, 
cg04549977, cg06029846, cg10043253 and cg15658376) with significant prognostic 
value in EC. We constructed a prognostic model using these sites, demonstrating 
satisfactory predictive performance. The low-risk group showed higher immune 
cell infiltration. Notably, methylation of site cg03906681 was negatively 
related to CD8 T cell infiltration, whereas cg04549977 exhibited positive 
correlations with immune infiltration, particularly in macrophages, activated B 
cells, dendritic cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. PD0325901_1060 was 
strongly correlated with risk scores, indicating a potential therapeutic 
response for high-risk EC patients.
CONCLUSION: We have developed a robust DNA methylation-based prognostic model 
for EC, which holds promise for improving prognosis prediction and personalized 
treatment approaches. These findings may contribute to better management of EC 
patients, particularly in identifying those at higher risk who may benefit from 
tailored interventions.

PURPOSE: Liver cancer incidence among American Indians/Alaska Natives has risen 
over the past 20 years. Peripheral blood DNA methylation may be associated with 
liver cancer and could be used as a biomarker for cancer risk. We evaluated the 
association of blood DNA methylation with risk of liver cancer.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study in 2324 American Indians, 
between age 45 and 75 years, from Arizona, Oklahoma, North Dakota and South 
Dakota who participated in the Strong Heart Study between 1989 and 1991. Liver 
cancer deaths (n = 21) were ascertained using death certificates obtained 
through 2017. The mean follow-up duration (SD) for non-cases was 25.1 (5.6) 
years and for cases, 11.0 (8.8) years. DNA methylation was assessed from blood 
samples collected at baseline using MethylationEPIC BeadChip 850 K arrays. We 
used Cox regression models adjusted for age, sex, center, body mass index, 
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking, alcohol consumption, and immune 
cell proportions to examine the associations.
RESULTS: We identified 9 CpG sites associated with liver cancer. cg16057201 
annotated to MRFAP1) was hypermethylated among cases vs. non-cases (hazard ratio 
(HR) for one standard deviation increase in methylation was 1.25 (95% CI 1.14, 
1.37). The other eight CpGs were hypomethylated and the corresponding HRs (95% 
CI) ranged from 0.58 (0.44, 0.75) for cg04967787 (annotated to PPRC1) to 0.77 
(0.67, 0.88) for cg08550308. We also assessed 7 differentially methylated CpG 
sites associated with liver cancer in previous studies. The adjusted HR for 
cg15079934 (annotated to LPS1) was 1.93 (95% CI 1.10, 3.39).
CONCLUSIONS: Blood DNA methylation may be associated with liver cancer mortality 
and may be altered during the development of liver cancer.

Hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)] is a common environmental pollutant and chronic 
exposure to Cr(VI) causes lung cancer and other types of cancer in humans, 
although the mechanism of Cr(VI) carcinogenesis remains elusive. Cr(VI) has been 
considered as a genotoxic carcinogen, but accumulating evidence indicates that 
Cr(VI) also causes various epigenetic toxic effects that play important roles in 
Cr(VI) carcinogenesis. However, it is not clear how Cr(VI)-caused epigenetic 
dysregulations contributes to Cr(VI) carcinogenesis. This study investigates 
whether Cr(VI) epigenetic toxic effect has an impact on its genotoxic effect. It 
was found that chronic low dose of Cr(VI) exposure time-dependently 
down-regulates the expression of a critical DNA damage repair protein 
O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), leading to the increases of the 
levels of the highly mutagenic and carcinogenic DNA lesion O6-methylguanine 
(O6-MeG) in human bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells. Moreover, the levels of 
MGMT and O6-MeG in chronic Cr(VI) exposure-caused human lung cancer tissues are 
also significantly lower and higher than that in the adjacent normal lung 
tissues, respectively. It was further determined that chronic low dose of Cr(VI) 
exposure-transformed BEAS-2B cells display impaired DNA damage repair capacity 
and a high sensitivity to the toxicity of the alkylating chemotherapeutic drug 
Temozolomide. In contrast, stably overexpressing MGMT in parental BEAS-2B cells 
reverses chronic low dose of Cr(VI) exposure-caused DNA damage repair deficiency 
and significantly reduces cell transformation by Cr(VI). Further mechanistical 
studies revealed that chronic low dose of Cr(VI) exposure down-regulates MGMT 
expression through epigenetic mechanisms by increasing DNA methylation and 
histone H3 repressive modifications. Taken together, these findings suggest that 
epigenetic down-regulation of a crucial DNA damage repair protein MGMT 
contributes significantly to the genotoxic effect and cell transformation caused 
by chronic low dose of Cr(VI) exposure.

BACKGROUND: Women living in disadvantaged neighborhoods present with increased 
prevalence rates of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). This study takes a 
spatiotemporal epidemiological approach to understand the impact of 
socioenvironmental contextual factors on TNBC prevalence rates.
METHODS: We analyzed 935 TNBC cases from a major cancer center registry, between 
2005 and 2017, to explore spatial and space-time clusters of TNBC prevalence 
rates at the census tract and neighborhood scales. Spatial regression analysis 
was performed to examine relationships between nine socioenvironmental factors 
and TNBC prevalence rates at both ecological scales.
RESULTS: We observed spatial clustering of high TNBC prevalence rates along a 
north-south corridor of Miami-Dade County along Interstate 95, a region 
containing several majority non-Hispanic Black neighborhoods. Among the ecologic 
measures, the percent of a region designated as a brownfield was associated with 
TNBC prevalence rates at the tract-level (β = 4.27; SE = 1.08; P < 0.001) and 
neighborhood-level (β = 8.61; SE = 2.20; P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Our spatiotemporal analysis identified robust patterns of hot spots 
of TNBC prevalence rates in a corridor of several disadvantaged neighborhoods in 
the northern half of the county. These patterns of TNBC align with the 
literature regarding at-risk groups and neighborhood-level effects on TNBC; 
however, remain to be validated in a population-based sample.
IMPACT: Spatial epidemiological approaches can help public health officials and 
cancer care providers improve place-specific screening, patient care, and 
understanding of socioenvironmental factors that may shape breast cancer subtype 
through gene-environment and epigenetic interactions.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: The obesity-associated nonalcoholic fatty liver disease 
represents a common cause of pediatric liver diseases, including the pediatric 
liver cancer hepatoblastoma. The mechanisms behind the development of fatty 
liver in children are not yet known. We examined the role of the C/EBPα-p300 
pathway in the development of maternal obesity-associated fatty liver phenotype 
in offspring.
METHODS: Because the ability of C/EBPα to promote fatty liver phenotype is 
enhanced by CDK4-mediated phosphorylation of C/EBPα at Ser193 and subsequent 
formation of C/EBPα-p300 complexes, we used wild-type (WT) and C/EBPα-S193D and 
C/EBPα-S193A mutant mice to study the effects of maternal high-fat diet (HFD) on 
the liver health of offspring. The females of these mouse lines were fed an HFD 
before mating, and the pups were further subjected to either an HFD or a normal 
diet for 12 weeks.
RESULTS: WT female mice on the HFD before and during pregnancy and their 
subsequent offspring on the HFD had severe fatty liver, fibrosis, and an 
increased rate of liver proliferation. However, the HFD in C/EBPα-S193A mice did 
not cause development of these disorders. In HFD-HFD treated WT mice, C/EBPα is 
phosphorylated at Ser193 and forms complexes with p300, which activate 
expression of genes involved in development of fatty liver, fibrosis, and 
proliferation. However, S193A-C/EBPα mice do not have complexes of C/EBPα-S193A 
with p300, leading to a lack of activation of genes of fatty liver, fibrosis, 
and proliferation. The mutant C/EBPα-S193D mice have accelerated cdk4-dependent 
pathway and have developed steatosis at early stages.
CONCLUSIONS: These studies identified the epigenetic cause of obese 
pregnancy-associated liver diseases and suggest a potential therapy based on 
inhibition of cdk4-ph-S193-C/EBPα-p300 pathway.

OBJECTIVES: Bladder cancer (BLCA) is a molecular heterogeneous disease with 
known genetic distinctive signatures. However, DNA methylation is highly 
prevalent across a wide range of tumors, suggesting its potential in 
oncogenesis. Here, we aimed to interrogate the role of nine epigenetic 
alterations as diagnostic and prognostic markers in BLCA.
METHODS: DNA methylation, gene expression, and clinicopathological information 
were retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas data portal. Methylation values and 
gene expression were assessed to determine their association with normal and 
malignant tissue. Additionally, we studied the association between methylation 
values and clinicopathological variables. For the prognostic model, Kaplan-Meier 
Survival curves were generated. Lastly, univariate and multivariate analysis 
were performed to evaluate the simultaneous impact of methylation and 
clinicopathological variables on the risk of tumor progression and survival.
RESULTS: Nine CpG sites' methylation β -values involved in our study 
demonstrated different methylation signatures between normal and malignant 
urothelium. Hypermethylated CpGs were overrepresented in tumor tissue 
(p < 0.0001). Opposingly, 4 CpG sites showed lower methylation values in tumor 
samples (p < 0.0001). Cg12743248high and cg17192862low are risk factors for 
progression-free survival, whereas cg12374721high (HR:3.003 (1.283-7.030)) also 
demonstrated to be the most valuable independent risk factor for disease 
progression and a risk factor for overall survival.
CONCLUSIONS: We have identified that methylated cg12374721 shows promise as a 
diagnostic and independent prognostic marker in BLCA progression.

BACKGROUND: GrimAge acceleration (GAA), an epigenetic marker that represents 
physiologic aging, is associated with age-related diseases including cancer and 
cardiovascular diseases. However, the associations between GAA and muscle mass 
and function are unknown.
METHODS: We estimated measures of GAA in 1 118 Black and White participants from 
the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study at exam 
years (Y) 15 (2000-2001) and 20 (2005-2006). Abdominal muscle composition was 
measured using CT scans at the Y25 (2010-2011) visit. We used multivariate 
regression models to examine associations of GAA estimates with muscle imaging 
measurements.
RESULTS: In the CARDIA study, each 1-year higher GAA was associated with an 
average 1.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.6%, 1.5%) higher intermuscular 
adipose tissue (IMAT) volume for abdominal muscles. Each 1-year higher GAA was 
associated with an average -0.089 Hounsfield unit (HU; 95% CI: -0.146, -0.032) 
lower lean muscle attenuation and an average -0.049 HU (95% CI: -0.092, -0.007) 
lower IMAT attenuation for abdominal muscles. Stratified analyses showed that 
GAA was more strongly associated with higher abdominal muscle IMAT volume in 
females and significantly associated with lower lean muscle attenuation for 
White participants only.
CONCLUSIONS: Higher GAA is associated with higher abdominal muscle IMAT volume 
and lower lean muscle attenuation in a midlife population.

Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the most prevalent form of thyroid cancer. 
Methylation of some genes plays a crucial role in the tendency to malignancy as 
well as poor prognosis of thyroid cancer, suggesting that methylation features 
can serve as complementary markers for molecular diagnosis. In this study, we 
aimed to develop and validate a diagnostic model for PTC based on DNA 
methylation markers. A total of 142 thyroid nodule tissue samples containing 84 
cases of PTC and 58 cases of thyroid adenoma (TA) were collected for reduced 
representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) and subsequent analysis. The 
diagnostic model was constructed by the logistic regression (LR) method followed 
by 5-cross validation and based on 94 tissue methylation haplotype block (MHB) 
markers. The model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic 
curve (AUROC) of 0.974 (95% CI, 0.964-0.981) on 108 training samples and 0.917 
(95% CI, 0.864-0.973) on 27 independent testing samples. The diagnostic model 
scores showed significantly high in males (P = 0.0016), age ≤ 45 years 
(P = 0.026), high body mass index (BMI) (P = 0.040), lymph node metastasis 
(P = 0.00052) and larger nodules (P = 0.0017) in the PTC group, and the risk 
score of this diagnostic model showed significantly high in recurrent PTC group 
(P = 0.0005). These results suggest that the diagnostic model can be expected to 
be a powerful tool for PTC diagnosis and there are more potential clinical 
applications of methylation markers to be excavated.

Analysis of cell-free DNA methylation (cfDNAme), alone or combined with CA125, 
could help to detect ovarian cancers earlier and may reduce mortality. We 
assessed cfDNAme in regions of ZNF154, C2CD4D and WNT6 via targeted bisulfite 
sequencing in diagnostic and early detection (preceding diagnosis) settings. 
Diagnostic samples were obtained via prospective blood collection in cell-free 
DNA tubes in a convenience series of patients with a pelvic mass. Early 
detection samples were matched case-control samples derived from the UK Familial 
Ovarian Cancer Screening Study (UKFOCSS). In the diagnostic set (ncases  = 27, 
ncontrols  = 41), the specificity of cfDNAme was 97.6% (95% CI: 87.1%-99.9%). 
High-risk cancers were detected with a sensitivity of 80% (56.3%-94.3%). 
Combination of cfDNAme and CA125 resulted in a sensitivity of 94.4% 
(72.7%-99.9%) for high-risk cancers. Despite technical issues in the early 
detection set (ncases  = 29, ncontrols  = 29), the specificity of cfDNAme was 
100% (88.1%-100.0%). We detected 27.3% (6.0%-61.0%) of high-risk cases with 
relatively lower genomic DNA (gDNA) contamination. The sensitivity rose to 33.3% 
(7.5%-70.1%) in samples taken <1 year before diagnosis. We detected ovarian 
cancer in several patients up to 1 year before diagnosis despite technical 
limitations associated with archival samples (UKFOCSS). Combined cfDNAme and 
CA125 assessment may improve ovarian cancer screening in high-risk populations, 
but future large-scale prospective studies will be required to validate current 
findings.

Despite the progress made in cancer diagnosis and treatment, breast cancer 
remains the second leading cause of cancer-related death among the women. 
Exposure to elevated levels of endogenous estrogen or environmental estrogenic 
chemicals is an important risk factor for breast cancer. Estrogen metabolites 
and ROS generated during estrogen metabolism are known to play a critical role 
in estrogen carcinogenesis. However, the molecular mechanisms through which 
estrogen-induced ROS regulate gene expression is not clear. Epigenetic changes 
of DNA methylation and histone modifications are known to regulate genes 
expression. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate whether 
estrogen-induced ROS, through aberrant expression of epigenetic regulatory genes 
and epigenetic reprogramming, causes growth of breast cancer cells. Estrogen 
responsive MCF-7 and T47D human breast cancer cells were exposed to natural 
estrogen 17 beta-estradiol (E2) and synthetic estrogen Diethylstilbestrol (DES) 
both alone and in combination with antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine. Effects of 
NAC-mediated scavenging of estrogen-induced ROS on cell growth, gene expression, 
and histone modifications were measured. The result of MTT and cell cycle 
analysis revealed significant abrogation of E2 and DES-induced growth by 
scavenging ROS through NAC. E2 and DES caused significant changes in expression 
of epigenetic regulatory genes for DNA methylation and histone modifications as 
well as changes in both gene activating and repressive marks in the Histone H3. 
NAC restored the expression of epigenetic regulatory genes and changes in 
histone marks. Novel findings of this study suggest that estrogen can induce 
growth of breast cancer cells through ROS-dependent regulation of epigenetic 
regulatory genes and epigenetic reprogramming of histone marks.

Intraductal carcinoma of the prostate (IDC-P) is a lethal prostate cancer 
subtype that generally coexists with invasive high-grade prostate acinar 
adenocarcinoma (PAC) but exhibits distinct biological features compared with 
concomitant adenocarcinoma. In this study, we performed whole-exome, RNA, and 
DNA-methylation sequencing of IDC-P, concurrent invasive high-grade PAC lesions, 
and adjacent normal prostate tissues isolated from 22 radical prostatectomy 
specimens. Three evolutionary patterns of concurrent IDC-P and PAC were 
identified: early divergent, late divergent, and clonally distant. In contrast 
to those with a late divergent evolutionary pattern, tumors with clonally 
distant and early divergent evolutionary patterns showed higher genomic, 
epigenomic, transcriptional, and pathologic heterogeneity between IDC-P and PAC. 
Compared with coexisting PAC, IDC-P displayed increased expression of adverse 
prognosis-associated genes. Survival analysis based on an independent cohort of 
505 patients with metastatic prostate cancer revealed that IDC-P carriers with 
lower risk International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade 1-4 
adenocarcinoma displayed a castration-resistant free survival as poor as those 
with the highest risk ISUP grade 5 tumors that lacked concurrent IDC-P. 
Furthermore, IDC-P exhibited robust cell-cycle progression and androgen receptor 
activities, characterized by an enrichment of cellular proliferation-associated 
master regulators and genes involved in intratumoral androgen biosynthesis. 
Overall, this study provides a molecular groundwork for the aggressive behavior 
of IDC-P and could help identify potential strategies to improve treatment of 
IDC-P.
SIGNIFICANCE: The genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic characterization of 
concurrent intraductal carcinoma and adenocarcinoma of the prostate deepens the 
biological understanding of this lethal disease and provides a genetic basis for 
developing targeted therapies.

Helicobacter pylori induces DNA methylation in gastric mucosa, which links to 
gastric cancer (GC) risk. In contrast, CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) is 
defined as high levels of cancer-specific methylation and provides distinct 
molecular and clinicopathological features of GC. The association between those 
two types of methylation in GC remains unclear. We examined DNA methylation of 
well-validated H. pylori infection associated genes in GC and its adjacent 
mucosa and investigated its association with CIMP, various molecular subtypes 
and clinical features. We studied 50 candidate loci in 24 gastric samples to 
identify H. pylori infection associated genes. Identified loci were further 
examined in 624 gastric tissue from 217 primary GC, 217 adjacent mucosa, and 190 
mucosae from cancer-free subjects. We identified five genes (IGF2, SLC16A2, 
SOX11, P2RX7, and MYOD1) as hypermethylated in H. pylori infected gastric 
mucosa. In non-neoplastic mucosa, methylation of H. pylori infection associated 
genes was higher in patients with GC than those without. In primary GC tissues, 
higher methylation of H. pylori infection associated genes correlated with 
CIMP-positive and its related features, such as MLH1 methylated cases. On the 
other hand, GC with lower methylation of these genes presented aggressive 
clinicopathological features including undifferentiated histopathology, advanced 
stage at diagnosis. H. pylori infection associated DNA methylation is correlated 
with CIMP, specific molecular and clinicopathological features in GC, supporting 
its utility as promising biomarker in this tumor type.

OBJECTIVE: The presence of intestinal metaplasia (IM) is a risk factor for 
gastric cancer. However, it is still controversial whether IM itself is 
precancerous or paracancerous. Here, we aimed to explore the precancerous nature 
of IM by analysing epigenetic alterations.
DESIGN: Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis was conducted by EPIC BeadArray 
using IM crypts isolated by Alcian blue staining. Chromatin immunoprecipitation 
sequencing for H3K27ac and single-cell assay for transposase-accessible 
chromatin by sequencing were conducted using IM mucosa. NOS2 was induced using 
Tet-on gene expression system in normal cells.
RESULTS: IM crypts had a methylation profile unique from non-IM crypts, showing 
extensive DNA hypermethylation in promoter CpG islands, including those of 
tumour-suppressor genes. Also, the IM-specific methylation profile, namely 
epigenetic footprint, was present in a fraction of gastric cancers with a higher 
frequency than expected, and suggested to be associated with good overall 
survival. IM organoids had remarkably high NOS2 expression, and NOS2 induction 
in normal cells led to accelerated induction of aberrant DNA methylation, namely 
epigenetic instability, by increasing DNA methyltransferase activity. IM mucosa 
showed dynamic enhancer reprogramming, including the regions involved in higher 
NOS2 expression. NOS2 had open chromatin in IM cells but not in gastric cells, 
and IM cells had frequent closed chromatin of tumour-suppressor genes, 
indicating their methylation-silencing. NOS2 expression in IM-derived organoids 
was upregulated by interleukin-17A, a cytokine secreted by extracellular 
bacterial infection.
CONCLUSIONS: IM cells were considered to have a precancerous nature potentially 
with an increased chance of converting into cancer cells, and an accelerated DNA 
methylation induction due to abnormal NOS2 expression.

PURPOSE: Mosaic BRCA1 promoter methylation (BRCA1meth) increases the risk of 
early-onset breast cancer, triple-negative breast cancer and ovarian cancer. As 
mosaic BRCA1meth are believed to occur de novo, their role in family 
breast/ovarian cancer has not been assessed.
PATIENTS: Blood-derived DNA from 20 unrelated affected cases from families with 
aggregation of breast/ovarian cancer, but with no germline pathogenic variants 
in BRCA1/2, PALB2 or RAD51C/D, were screened by methylation-sensitive 
high-resolution melting. CpG analysis was performed by pyrosequencing on blood 
and buccal swab. Two probands carried a pathogenic variant in a 
moderate-penetrance gene (ATM and BARD1), and 8 of 18 others (44%) carried 
BRCA1meth (vs none of the 20 age-matched controls). Involvement of BRCA1 in 
tumourigenesis in methylated probands was demonstrated in most tested cases by 
detection of a loss of heterozygosity and a homologous recombination deficiency 
signature. Among the eight methylated probands, two had relatives with breast 
cancer with detectable BRCA1meth in blood, including one with high methylation 
levels in two non-tumour tissues.
CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of mosaic BRCA1meth in patients with 
breast/ovarian cancer with affected relatives, as well as this first description 
of a family aggregation of mosaic BRCA1meth, shows how this de novo event can 
contribute to hereditary breast/ovarian cancer pedigrees.

BACKGROUND: Epigenetic clocks use CpG DNA methylation to estimate biological 
age. Acceleration is associated with cancer, heart disease, and shorter life 
span. Few studies evaluate DNA methylation age and pregnancy outcomes. 
AgeAccelGrim is a novel epigenetic clock that combines 7 DNA methylation 
components.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine whether maternal biological aging (via 
AgeAccelGrim) is associated with early preterm birth.
STUDY DESIGN: A prospective cohort of patients with singleton pregnancies and at 
high risk of spontaneous preterm birth delivering at a tertiary university 
hospital were included in this study. Genome-wide CpG methylation was measured 
using the Illumina EPIC BeadChip (Illumina, Inc, San Diego, CA) from maternal 
blood samples obtained at <28 weeks of gestation. AgeAccelGrim and its 7 DNA 
methylation components were estimated by the Horvath DNA methylation age online 
tool. Positive values are associated with accelerated biological aging, whereas 
negative values are associated with slower biological aging relative to each 
subject's age. The primary outcome was preterm birth at <34 weeks of gestation 
(any indication). The secondary outcomes were preterm birth at <37 and <28 weeks 
of gestation. AgeAccelGrim was analyzed as a continuous variable and in 
quartiles. Exploratory analyses evaluated each of the 7 DNA methylation 
components included in the composite AgeAccelGrim. Data were analyzed by 
chi-square test, t test, rank-sum test, logistic regression (controlling a 
priori for maternal age, cell counts, low socioeconomic status, and gestational 
age at the time of sample collection), and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses. The 
log-rank test was used to test the equality of the survival functions.
RESULTS: Overall, 163 patients met the inclusion criteria. Of the patients, 48%, 
39%, and 21% delivered at <37, <34, and <28 weeks of gestation, respectively. 
The median AgeAccelGrim was -0.35 years (interquartile range, -2.24 to 1.31) for 
those delivering at term. Those delivering preterm had higher AgeAccelGrim 
values that were inversely proportional to delivery gestational age (preterm 
birth at <37 weeks of gestation: +0.40 years [interquartile range: -1.21 
to +2.28]; preterm birth at <34 weeks of gestation: +0.51 years [interquartile 
range: -1.05 to +2.67]; preterm birth at <28 weeks of gestation: +1.05 years 
[interquartile range: -0.72 to +2.72]). Estimated DNA methylation of the 7 
epigenetic clock component values was increased among those with preterm birth 
at <34 weeks of gestation, although the differences were only significant for 
DNA methylation of plasminogen activation inhibitor 1. In regression models, 
AgeAcccelGrim was associated with an elevated risk of preterm birth with 
increasing magnitude for increasing severity of preterm birth. For each 1-year 
increase in the AgeAccelGrim value (ie, each 1-year increase in biological age 
compared with chronologic age), the adjusted odds of preterm birth were 11% 
(adjusted odds ratio, 1.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.00-1.24), 13% (adjusted 
odds ratio, 1.13; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.26), and 18% (adjusted odds 
ratio, 1.18; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.35) higher for preterm birth at 
<37, <34, and <28 weeks of gestation, respectively. Similarly, individuals with 
accelerated biological aging (≥75th percentile AgeAccelGrim) had more than 
double the odds of preterm birth at <34 weeks of gestation (adjusted odds ratio, 
2.36; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-5.08) and more than triple the odds of 
preterm birth at <28 weeks of gestation (adjusted odds ratio, 3.89; 95% 
confidence interval, 1.61-9.38). The adjusted odds ratio for preterm birth at 
<37 weeks of gestation was 1.73 but spanned the null (adjusted odds ratio, 1.73; 
95% confidence interval, 0.81-3.69). In Kaplan-Meier survival analyses, those in 
the highest AgeAccelGrim quartile delivered the earliest (log-rank P value of 
<.001).
CONCLUSION: Accelerated biological aging was associated with preterm birth among 
high-risk patients. Future research confirming these findings and elucidating 
factors that slow biological aging may improve birth outcomes.

Multi-Omics Deep-Learning Prediction of Homologous Recombination Deficiency-Like 
Phenotype Improved Risk Stratification and Guided Therapeutic Decisions in 
Gynecological Cancers.

Zhang Y, Yan C, Yang Z, Zhou M, Sun J.

Homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) is a well-recognized important 
biomarker in determining the clinical benefits of platinum-based chemotherapy 
and PARP inhibitor therapy for patients diagnosed with gynecologic cancers. 
Accurate prediction of HRD phenotype remains challenging. Here, we proposed a 
novel Multi-Omics integrative Deep-learning framework named MODeepHRD for 
detecting HRD-positive phenotype. MODeepHRD utilizes a convolutional attention 
autoencoder that effectively leverages omics-specific and cross-omics 
complementary knowledge learning. We trained MODeepHRD on 351 ovarian cancer 
(OV) patients using transcriptomic, DNA methylation and mutation data, and 
validated it in 2133 OV samples of 22 datasets. The predicted HRD-positive 
tumors were significantly associated with improved survival (HR = 0.68; 95% CI, 
0.60-0.77; log-rank p < 0.001 for meta-cohort; HR = 0.5; 95% CI, 0.29-0.86; 
log-rank p = 0.01 for ICGC-OV cohort) and higher response to platinum-based 
chemotherapy compared to predicted HRD-negative tumors. The translational 
potential of MODeepHRDs was further validated in multicenter breast and 
endometrial cancer cohorts. Furthermore, MODeepHRD outperforms conventional 
machine-learning methods and other similar task approaches. In conclusion, our 
study demonstrates the promising value of deep learning as a solution for HRD 
testing in the clinical setting. MODeepHRD holds potential clinical 
applicability in guiding patient risk stratification and therapeutic decisions, 
providing valuable insights for precision oncology and personalized treatment 
strategies.

Bevacizumab plays an important role in the first and second line treatment for 
metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). And induction of hypoxia and the tumors 
response to it plays an important role in determining the efficacy of 
antiangiogenic therapy while the connection between them remains unclear. Here, 
we found that lactate accumulated in the tumor environment of CRC and acted as 
substrates for histone lactylation, and this process was further induced by 
cellular enhanced glycolysis in hypoxia. We determined that CRC patients 
resistant to bevacizumab treatment presented with elevated levels of histone 
lactylation and inhibition of histone lactylation efficiently suppressed CRC 
tumorigenesis, progression and survival in hypoxia. Histone lactylation promoted 
the transcription of RUBCNL/Pacer, facilitating autophagosome maturation through 
interacting with BECN1 (beclin 1) and mediating the recruitment and function of 
the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex, which had a crucial role in 
hypoxic cancer cells proliferation and survival. Moreover, combining inhibition 
of histone lactylation and macroautophagy/autophagy with bevacizumab treatment 
demonstrated remarkable treatment efficacy in bevacizumab-resistance 
patients-derived pre-clinical models. These findings delivered a new exploration 
and important supplement of metabolic reprogramming-epigenetic regulation, and 
provided a new strategy for improving clinical efficacy of bevacizumab in CRC by 
inhibition of histone lactylation.Abbreviations: 2-DG: 2-deoxy-D-glucose; BECN1:

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Epigenetic plasticity is a major challenge in 
cancer-targeted therapy. However, the molecular basis governing this process has 
not yet been clearly defined. Despite the considerable success of 
poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) in cancer therapy, the limited 
response to PARPi, especially in HCC, has been a bottleneck in its clinical 
implications. Herein, we investigated the molecular basis of the histone 
methyltransferase KMT5C (lysine methyltransferase 5C) that governs PARPi 
sensitivity and explored a potential therapeutic strategy for enhancing PARPi 
efficacy.
APPROACH AND RESULTS: We identified KMT5C, a trimethyltransferase of H4K20, as a 
targetable epigenetic factor that promoted liver tumor growth in mouse de novo 
MYC/Trp53-/- and xenograft liver tumor models. Notably, induction of KMT5C by 
environmental stress was crucial for DNA repair and HCC cell survival. 
Mechanistically, KMT5C interacted with the pivotal component of homologous 
recombination repair, RAD51, and promoted RAD51/RAD54 complex formation, which 
was essential for the activation of dsDNA breaks repair. This effect depended on 
the methyltransferase activity of KMT5C. We further demonstrated that the 
function of KMT5C in promoting HCC progression was dependent on RAD51. 
Importantly, either a pharmacological inhibitor (A196) or genetic inhibition of 
KMT5C sensitized liver cancer cells to PARPi.
CONCLUSIONS: KMT5C played a vital role in promoting liver cancer progression by 
activating the DNA repair response. Our results revealed a novel therapeutic 
approach using the KMT5C inhibitor A196, concurrent with olaparib, as a 
potential HCC therapy.

BACKGROUND: Unpacking molecular perturbations associated with features of 
schizophrenia is a critical step toward understanding phenotypic heterogeneity 
in this disorder. Recent epigenome-wide association studies have uncovered 
pervasive dysregulation of DNA methylation in schizophrenia; however, clinical 
features of the disorder that account for a large proportion of phenotypic 
variability are relatively underexplored.
METHODS: We comprehensively analyzed patterns of DNA methylation in a cohort of 
381 individuals with schizophrenia from the deeply phenotyped Australian 
Schizophrenia Research Bank. Epigenetic changes were investigated in association 
with cognitive status, age of onset, treatment resistance, Global Assessment of 
Functioning scores, and common variant polygenic risk scores for schizophrenia. 
We subsequently explored alterations within genes previously associated with 
psychiatric illness, phenome-wide epigenetic covariance, and epigenetic scores.
RESULTS: Epigenome-wide association studies of the 5 primary traits identified 
662 suggestively significant (p < 6.72 × 10-5) differentially methylated probes, 
with a further 432 revealed after controlling for schizophrenia polygenic risk 
on the remaining 4 traits. Interestingly, we uncovered many probes within genes 
associated with a variety of psychiatric conditions as well as significant 
epigenetic covariance with phenotypes and exposures including acute myocardial 
infarction, C-reactive protein, and lung cancer. Epigenetic scores for 
treatment-resistant schizophrenia strikingly exhibited association with 
clozapine administration, while epigenetic proxies of plasma protein expression, 
such as CCL17, MMP10, and PRG2, were associated with several features of 
schizophrenia.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings collectively provide novel evidence suggesting that 
several features of schizophrenia are associated with alteration of DNA 
methylation, which may contribute to interindividual phenotypic variation in 
affected individuals.
