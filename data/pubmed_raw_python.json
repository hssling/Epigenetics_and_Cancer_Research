Epub 2025 Oct 30.\n\nSLAMF8 expression and prognostic significance in melanoma: A multi-omics and \nMendelian randomization study.\n\nLiu J(1), Han W(2), Shen G(1).\n\nAuthor information:\n(1)Department of Burn and Plastic Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of \nSoochow University, Suzhou, China, 215000.\n(2)Institute of Lung Health and Immunity, Helmholtz Zentrum München, Munich \n81377, Germany.\n\nBackgroundMelanoma represents one of the most aggressive skin cancers, \nresponsible for over 75% of skin cancer-related deaths despite comprising only \n5% of cases. Despite therapeutic advances, patient responses remain variable and \nunpredicv. The Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule (SLAM) family regulates \nimmune cell communication, with SLAMF8 being predominantly expressed on myeloid \ncells. However, SLAMF8's specific role in melanoma pathogenesis remains largely \nunexplored.MethodsIn this retrospective integrative study, we systematically \ninvestigated SLAMF8's role in melanoma through multi-omics analyses using TIMER, \nGEPIA, and UALCAN databases, following the STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting \nof Observational Studies in Epidemiology) guidelines for observational data \nreporting. Functional studies were conducted in A-375 and SK-MEL-28 melanoma \ncell lines using siRNA-mediated knockdown, followed by migration, invasion, and \nproliferation assays. DNA methylation patterns were analyzed via the SMART \ndatabase, while mutation profiles were examined using cBioPortal and COSMIC. \nImmune infiltration analysis was performed through TIMER, and pathway \nassociations were investigated using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis and \nprotein-protein interaction networks. Finally, two-sample Mendelian \nRandomization analysis assessed the causal relationship between SLAMF8 \nexpression and melanoma susceptibility.ResultsSLAMF8 expression was \nsignificantly higher in metastatic melanoma compared to primary tumors, with \nexpression patterns varying across disease stages and between sexes. Higher \nSLAMF8 expression correlated with improved disease-free and overall survival. \nFunctional studies demonstrated that SLAMF8 knockdown significantly enhanced \nmelanoma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. DNA methylation analysis \nrevealed significant negative correlations between methylation at specific CpG \nsites and SLAMF8 expression, with hypermethylation associated with worse \nsurvival outcomes. Mutation analysis identified alterations in 10.21% of \nmelanoma patients. Immune infiltration studies demonstrated strong correlations \nbetween SLAMF8 expression and enhanced immune cell presence. GSEA linked SLAMF8 \nto critical immune pathways including allograft rejection, inflammatory \nresponse, and interferon signaling. Mendelian Randomization analysis established \na protective causal relationship between SLAMF8 and melanoma risk (OR = 0.39, \n95% CI = 0.21-0.74, p = 3.34e-03).ConclusionOur study demonstrates that SLAMF8 \nplays a critical role in melanoma by suppressing tumor progression and \nmodulating the immune microenvironment. Elevated SLAMF8 expression in metastatic \nmelanoma is associated with improved patient survival, suggesting its utility as \na prognostic biomarker. Furthermore, its tumor-suppressive effects and \nimmune-regulatory functions highlight SLAMF8 as a promising therapeutic target \nfor melanoma treatment strategies.\n\nDOI: 10.1177/18758592251392828\nPMID: 41166122 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: Declaration of conflicting interestsThe authors \ndeclared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, \nauthorship, and/or publication of this article.

This study addresses whether PBMC-derived methylation signatures \ncan discriminate clinical outcomes in EGFR-mutation LUAD subgroups.\nMETHODS: We performed genome-wide methylation analysis of PBMCs from LUAD \npatients using the Infinium Methylation EPIC 850 K array. Clinical \ncharacteristics were associated with overall survival (OS) through Cox \nregression. Prognostic differentially methylated positions (DMPs) were \nidentified via Lasso regression, followed by the construction of risk-score \nmodels. Functional enrichment (KEGG/GO) and tissue microarray-based \nimmunohistochemistry (IHC) for FKBP4 expression (n = 90 LUAD samples) were \nconducted. Analyses were conducted in R 4.4.1 with curated Bioconductor \npackages.\nRESULTS: In the retrospective cohort of 174 Chinese LUAD patients (April \n2014-September 2019), PBMC analysis of 128 cases revealed 12 hypomethylated DMPs \nwere associated with OS. EGFR-mutant patients (n = 66) showed 325 significant \nDMPs (|Δβ|≥ 0.06, P ≤ 0.01), with four DMPs (cg05802998, cg19313959, cg00685115, \ncg15224444) independently predicting OS. The cg19313959 located in the TSS1500 \nregion of FKBP4 gene (Δβ = 0.21) demonstrated the strongest methylation shift. \nReduced FKBP4 protein expression was associated with improved survival \n(HR = 0.42, 95%CI 0.24-0.72). In EGFR-wildtype patients (n = 51), three \nprognostic DMPs emerged from 2,531 candidates. EGFR mutation-specific prognostic \nscoring models were established successfully, while pathway analyses revealed \ndivergent biological processes between EGFR subgroups.\nCONCLUSION: In this epigenome-wide study based on PBMCs in Chinese patients with \nLUAD, methylation signatures dependent on EGFR mutations and predictive of \nsurvival were identified.\n\n© 2025.

These lists were \ncross-referenced with DMG (n = 93) curated from 18 ART Epigenome-Wide \nAssociation Studies (EWAS) (2369 samples). Among the ART DMG, more than \none-third (n = 33) were leukemia, and six were pre-leukemia DMG, all \nrepresenting a significant enrichment. Seven of the enriched genes (NTM, PRSS16, \nSCAND3, SYCP1, TP73, ZNF184, and ISL1-DT) showed concordant methylation between \nART and leukemia/pre-leukemia. Moreover, five of the ART DMG are known targets \nfor somatic/germline alterations in leukemia: ATP10A, CHD2, FBRSL1, FGFR2, and \nSORCS1. The ART DMG were not significantly enriched in cancer genes, supporting \nthe hypothesis that ART may not link broadly to any cancer type but rather to \nleukemia.\nCONCLUSION: This study indicates that relatively few genes that are known \ntargets for somatic/germline mutation in cancer experience DNA methylation \nchanges in individuals conceived through ART. By contrast, DNA methylation \ndisturbances reported in leukemia represent more than one-third of those \nassociated with ART conception, thus raising the question of their role in \nleukemia risk in ART-conceived individuals. Among them, a few critical genes \nsuch as TP73, a tumor suppressor, were shown to be targeted for \nhypermethylation, both in ART and leukemia, warranting further investigation.\n\n© 2025.

Analysis of the CORDIS database reveals a persistent gap between the \nsocietal impact of endocrine disorders and their research prioritization. At \nnational funding level, endocrine societies report limited or little attention \nof national research funding toward endocrinology. The EndoCompass project-a \njoint initiative between the European Society of Endocrinology and the European \nSociety of Paediatric Endocrinology, aimed to identify and promote strategic \nresearch priorities in endocrine science to address critical hormone-related \nhealth challenges.\nMETHODS: Research priorities were established through comprehensive analysis of \nthe EU CORDIS database covering the Horizon 2020 framework period (2014-2020). \nExpert consultation in pituitary and neuroendocrine tumor endocrinology was \nconducted to identify key research priorities, followed by broader stakeholder \nengagement including society members and patient advocacy groups.\nRESULTS: Research priorities encompass congenital and acquired disorders, tumor \ndevelopment and progression, and neuroendocrine neoplasms. Key areas include \ngenetic/epigenetic factors, tumor microenvironment, personalized treatment \napproaches, developing preclinical models, and implementing artificial \nintelligence. Special emphasis is placed on aggressive tumors, hypothalamic \nsyndromes, and establishing pan-European biobanks and databases.\nCONCLUSIONS: This component of the EndoCompass project provides an \nevidence-based roadmap for strategic research investment. This framework \nidentifies crucial investigation areas into pituitary-neuroendocrine disease \npathophysiology, prevention, and treatment strategies, ultimately aimed at \nreducing the burden of these disorders on individuals and society. The findings \nsupport the broader EndoCompass objective of aligning research funding with \nareas of highest potential impact in endocrine health.\n\n© The Author(s) 2025.

Imbalance in their homeostasis might contribute to the pathogenesis \nof major age-related chronic diseases including type 2 diabetes (T2D) and \ncardiovascular diseases (CVD). Emerging evidence suggests that TEs may affect \nhealth outcomes via epigenetic changes. However, few epigenome-wide association \nstudies (EWAS) have explored TE-associated DNA methylation markers and their \nlinks to chronic disease outcomes.\nMETHODS: We conducted TE-specific exploratory EWAS using a random subcohort \n(n = 1030) from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition \n(EPIC)-Potsdam cohort. The association between identified CpG sites and incident \nchronic diseases was evaluated using a case-cohort design comprising random \nsubcohort participants and incident cases of T2D (n = 654) and CVD (n = 334). \nDNA methylation was measured with the MethylationEPIC BeadChip array. We used \nPrentice-weighted Cox proportional hazards regression models to estimate \nmultivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) \nfor the associations of TE-associated CpG sites with each incident chronic \ndisease.\nRESULTS: In the copper EWAS, we identified six CpG sites (cg00398673, \ncg03957124, cg05736499, cg07573872, cg11503550, and cg18513344) that were \nsignificantly associated with serum copper concentrations with a False Discovery \nRate < 0.05. All associated CpG sites showed lower methylation levels in \nassociation with higher serum copper levels. Higher methylation levels of \ncg00398673 (HR per SD: 0.74, 95% CI 0.63-0.88), cg03957124 (HR per SD: 0.52, 95% \nCI 0.41-0.66), cg05736499 (HR Q5 vs Q1: 0.25, 95% CI 0.14-0.47), and cg18513344 \n(HR Q5 vs Q1: 0.37, 95% CI 0.24-0.57) were associated with decreased risk of \ndeveloping T2D, and higher methylation levels of cg07573872 were associated with \ndecreased risk of developing CVD (HR per SD: 0.85, 95% CI 0.72-0.99). We did not \nobserve any CpG sites that were significantly associated with other TEs.\nCONCLUSIONS: Serum copper levels are inversely associated with a number of CpG \nsites. Methylation levels at these CpG sites were inversely associated with \ndeveloping T2D and CVD. These findings may provide new insights on understanding \nthe increased risk of T2D and CVD with elevated blood copper levels.\n\n© 2025.

These findings suggest that the clock captures a \ntumor's effective growth rate resulting from the evolutionary-ecological \ncompetition between intrinsic growth potential and external systemic pressures. \nBecause of the clock's ability to differentiate old and stable from young and \naggressive tumors, it has potential applications in risk stratification of \nearly-stage breast cancers and guiding early detection efforts.\n\n© 2025.

To \naddress this, we investigate the epigenomic landscape of prostate tumor biopsies \nfrom 25 treatment-naïve male patients by analyzing chromatin \ncompartmentalization patterns. Our analysis reveals two distinct molecular \nsubtypes: one with a Low Degree of Decompartmentalization (LDD) and another with \na High Degree of Decompartmentalization (HDD). Here we show that the HDD \nsubgroup exhibits extensive chromatin reorganization associated with diminished \noncogenic potential. This subtype shows repression of molecular pathways \ninvolved in extracellular matrix remodeling and cellular plasticity. From this \ndistinction, we derive an 18-gene transcriptional signature capable of \ndifferentiating HDD from LDD cases. Importantly, we validate the prognostic \nrelevance of this signature in multiple independent cohorts totaling over 900 \npatients. Our findings suggest that epigenetic-derived signature at the time of \ndiagnostic biopsy can offer a powerful tool for risk stratification in prostate \ncancer.\n\n© 2025.

Despite its recognized role, comprehensive pan-cancer \nanalyses of TEAD4 expression patterns, prognostic significance, and therapeutic \nimplications remain scarce.\nMETHODS: We conducted a systematic evaluation of TEAD4 across diverse tumor \ntypes using publicly available datasets, including TCGA. Analyses included gene \nexpression profiling, prognostic correlation, functional enrichment, and drug \nsensitivity assessments. Additionally, in vitro assays were performed to \nvalidate the functional roles of TEAD4 in cancer cell behavior.\nRESULTS: TEAD4 was significantly overexpressed in multiple cancers and \nassociated with unfavorable prognosis. Functional enrichment analyses implicated \nTEAD4 in oncogenic processes such as proliferation, metastasis, stemness \nmaintenance, and immune regulation. In vitro experiments confirmed that TEAD4 \npromotes cancer cell proliferation, migration, and stem cell-like properties, \nwhile TEAD4 knockdown reversed these phenotypes. TEAD4 expression correlated \nwith genomic instability, epigenetic alterations, and remodeling of the tumor \nmicroenvironment. Drug sensitivity analysis indicated that elevated TEAD4 levels \nwere linked to resistance against several chemotherapeutic agents. Furthermore, \na prognostic model based on TEAD4 target gene expression successfully stratified \npatients by survival risk.\nDISCUSSION: Our findings highlight the multifaceted roles of TEAD4 in cancer \nbiology, emphasizing its contribution to tumor progression, therapy resistance, \nand patient outcomes. The evidence supports TEAD4 as a promising prognostic \nbiomarker and therapeutic target, offering new avenues for translational cancer \nresearch.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Liu, Song, Kang, Xue, Zhao, Jin, Liu and Wang.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2025.1688563\nPMCID: PMC12518352\nPMID: 41098715 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest."

Although transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) is the \nstandard treatment for NMIBC, there remains a considerable risk of postoperative \nresidual tumors. Accurately identifying patients who require repeat \ntransurethral resection of bladder tumor (Re-TURBT) remains a significant \nclinical challenge. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exhibits high accuracy in \ndetecting residual tumors after TURBT, aiding clinical decision-making. However, \nits relatively low specificity limits its clinical applicability. Urinary \nmethylation markers, particularly those associated with H4 cluster protein 6 \n(H4C6) and Twist Family BHLH Transcription Factor 1 (TWIST1), have demonstrated \nhigh sensitivity and specificity in detecting bladder cancer, showing promising \nclinical performance. The combined detection of H4C6 and TWIST1 gene methylation \nprovides a more reliable method for identifying residual tumors post-TURBT. \nIntegrating the VI-RADS score with urine gene methylation analysis could \ncomplement each other, improving the accuracy of residual tumor detection and \nenhancing clinical applicability.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the predictive value of \nclinical/pathological factors, urinary H4C6 and TWIST1 gene methylation, and \ntheir combined performance in identifying postoperative residual tumors in NMIBC \npatients.\nMETHODS: Morning urine samples from NMIBC patients at Zhongshan City People's \nHospital (June 2022-August 2024) were analyzed for H4C6 and TWIST1 methylation \nlevels. Patients underwent MRI and Re-TURBT. Logistic regression was used to \nidentify predictors of residual tumors, and a nomogram was developed. Model \nperformance was evaluated using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves \nand decision curve analysis (DCA).\nRESULTS: Among the 55 patients included in the study, the area under the ROC \ncurve (AUC) for urinary H4C6 methylation was 0.698, whereas TWIST1 methylation \nhad an AUC of 0.758. Combined dual-gene methylation yielded an AUC of 0.764. The \nAUC for VI-RADS scoring was 0.888. When dual-gene methylation and hematuria were \ncombined with VI-RADS scores, the prediction model achieved an AUC of 0.972. DCA \ndemonstrated that the prediction model offers substantial clinical benefit \nacross a broad range of threshold probabilities. The combined prediction model \nof dual-gene methylation, hematuria, and VI-RADS scores offers a powerful \nnon-invasive method to assist clinicians in identifying high-risk patients with \nresidual tumors after TURBT, thereby reducing unnecessary Re-TURBT and improving \npatient management.\nCONCLUSION: Urinary H4C6 and TWIST1 gene methylation, along with VI-RADS \nscoring, show high diagnostic performance in predicting residual tumors \nfollowing TURBT in NMIBC patients. A combined prediction model incorporating \ndual-gene methylation, hematuria, and VI-RADS scores achieves superior \ndiscrimination, excellent calibration, and strong clinical utility.\n\n© 2025.

Despite its success in achieving \nsurvivorship, many recipients later suffer from recurrent infections and \npulmonary complications. The mechanisms driving the complications after HSPC \ntransplantation later in life are unknown. However, the induction and/or \nmaintenance therapeutics might be driving the negative outcomes in treated \npatients. We investigated the effects of the cancer therapeutics topotecan and \n13-cis-retinoic acid (13cisRA) on cell phenotype and functions of HSPCs isolated \nfrom cord blood and primary monocytes from adult donors. In HSPCs, 13cisRA \nreduced autophagy and lysosomal activity, triggered a DNA damage response \nthrough increased γH2A.X and CDKN2 expression (including the spliced p14ARF \nisoform), and upregulated the epigenetic regulator SIRT3. 13cisRA also activated \nprimary monocytes, inducing CXCL8 and CCL2 production. By contrast, topotecan \nhad no effects on mature monocytes but induced DNA damage, metabolic remodeling, \nand epigenetic alterations in HSPCs. These changes included increased CDKN1A \nexpression, higher γH2A.X-positive cell frequency, autophagy activation, and \nSIRT1 upregulation. The differential effects of 13cisRA and topotecan on HSPCs \nand monocytes might underlie the long-term complications of autologous HSPC \ntransplantation. By modulating DNA damage, autophagy, and epigenetic pathways, \nthese therapies could influence hematopoietic recovery and immune \nreconstitution, offering insights for improving transplantation outcomes.\n\n© 2025.

The early detection of \ncervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) allows for CC prevention. Recent data \nhighlights the importance of epigenetic biomarkers, including non-coding RNAs \nsuch as miR-21 and miR-34a. Our aim was to investigate the interplay between \nKi-67 and p53 expression and their epigenetic regulation by miR-21 and miR-34a \nto better predict the course of CIN.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Tumor biopsies from 50 patients with CIN 1-3/HSIL were \nanalyzed. We performed immunohistochemical analysis of Ki-67 and p53 expression \nand qRT-PCR for the analysis of miRNA expression.\nRESULTS: The average miR-21 and miR-34a levels were 5.8 ± 2.8 and 1.42 ± 0.85 \n(a.u.), respectively, while Ki-67 and p53 averaged 136.9 ± 79.9 and 93.15 ± 49.5 \nH-score points. Positive correlations were found between miR-21 and Ki-67 (r = \n0.76) and miR-34a and p53 expressions (r = 0.65). Tumors with low Ki-67 showed \n2.48-fold lower miR-21 levels, and low p53 tumors showed 4.2-fold lower miR-34a \nlevels. While no correlation with age or menstrual status was found, miR-21 (r = \n0.78), Ki-67 (r = 0.68), and miR-34a (r = -0.59) correlated with CIN grading (p \n< 0.05). The miR-21 and Ki-67 levels increased in CIN 2 and CIN 3 compared to \nCIN 1 in both HPV-positive and HPV-negative samples. The miR-34a levels were the \nlowest in CIN 3 HPV-negative samples and significantly decreased with CIN \nprogression in HPV-positive samples. The p53 levels were significantly higher in \nCIN 3 cases of both the HPV-positive and HPV-negative groups.\nCONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that the miR‑21, miR-34a, Ki-67, and p53 \nexpression levels are significantly correlated with each other and are \ndistinctly associated with the progression of CIN grades and HPV status, \nhighlighting their potential as crucial CC biomarkers.\n\nDOI: 10.15407/exp-oncology.2025.02.223\nPMID: 41058458 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

The VEGF/VEGFR2 signaling pathway genes serve as risk factor \nfor metastasis and are associated with poor prognosis in many cancers including \nOC. DNA methylation of VEGF-A, VEGF-C and VEGFR2 genes contributing to their \ngenetic changes based on histological sub-types has not been thoroughly explored \nin OC. Thus, the study aimed to determine the DNA methylation status of these \ngenes in relation to their expression in tumor tissues and associated peritoneal \nfluid samples to evaluate usefulness of methylation as a prognostic indicator in \novarian carcinoma for future targeted therapies. Bisulfite-modified DNA \nmethylation was assessed via Methylation-Specific Polymerase chain reaction \n(MSP) and mRNA expression was examined via quantitative reverse transcription \nPCR (RT-PCR), respectively. Gene expression and promoter methylation were \nexamined in relation with clinical parameters in 100 OC samples. The methylation \nfrequency of VEGF-A, VEGF-C and VEGFR2 promoters was higher in tumor tissues and \nmatched Peritoneal Fluid (PF) compared to normal samples, while VEGF-A, VEGF-C \nand VEGFR2 mRNA expression levels were significantly elevated. Promoter \nmethylation levels for VEGF-A (82%), VEGF-C (76%) and VEGFR2 (82%) showed \nsignificantly higher levels compared to benign cystadenomas, whereas amounts of \nVEGF-A and VEGFR2 were significantly higher than benign samples (p = 0.0003 and \n0.001). Expression and promoter methylation for VEGF-A (p = 0.0004, 0.0001) and \nVEGFR2 (p = 0.005, 0.001) significantly correlated with differences in \nhistological sub-types in OC samples. No significant correlation was observed \nbetween promoter methylation and expression levels for VEGF-A, VEGF-C and VEGFR2 \ngenes. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis predicts poor prognosis for concurrent \nhigh expression and methylation of VEGF-A and VEGFR2 significantly correlated \nwith advanced stage (log-rank p = 0.03, 0.01) and tumor histology (log rank \np = 0.02, 0.01 respectively) in OC patients. Promoter methylation status of the \nVEGF-A and VEGFR2 genes could serve as valuable prognostic indicator in \npredicting poor prognosis in OC patients based on tumor histological sub-types.\n\n© 2025.

Here, by integrating \ntranscriptome and epigenetic multi-omics analyses of gastric tissues and mouse \nmodels, we identified that inhibitor of differentiation 4 (ID4) was \ndownregulated in H. pylori-infected gastric tissues and associated with \nprognosis of gastric cancer (GC). H. pylori infection remarkably increased the \nmethylation level of the ID4 promoter region in the GC patients and mouse \nmodels. ID4 served as a tumor suppressor gene in GC and was required for H. \npylori-mediated tumorigenic activities in vitro cellular and in vivo \ntumor-bearing mouse models. Moreover, H. pylori infection induced DNMT3B \nupregulation through recruiting KLF5 to its promoter and further promoted ID4 \nDNA methylation modification. Notably, ID4 formed heterodimers with the basic \nHLH transcription factors DEC1 to inhibit its transcriptional activity; \ntherefore, downregulation of ID4 promoted SHH/GLI1 signaling through a DEC1 \ndependent transcriptional modulation. Collectively, our findings indicate H. \npylori infection depends on DNMT3B to induce ID4 DNA methylation and ID4 \npromoter hypermethylation status is a potential biomarker to identify GC. Loss \nof ID4 could be a key component of H. pylori-mediated gastric tumorigenesis \nthrough dysregulation of DEC1/SHH/GLI1 axis, which provides potential \ntherapeutic targets in GC.\n\n© 2025.

Utilizing the GSE44001 and The Cancer Genome Atlas-CESC \ndatabases, a HAT-associated prognostic model comprising 7 pivotal genes was \nformulated through Lasso-Cox regression analysis. The integration of multiple \nbioinformatics algorithms (including Cibersort, ESTIMATE, ssGSEA, and TIDE) has \nenabled the profound delineation of immune microenvironmental characteristics \namong disparate risk groups. Utilizing molecular docking technology, we \nconducted a screening process that identified 2 potential target drugs. The \nprognostic model's predictive efficacy was successfully validated in an \nindependent cohort. The analysis has revealed that the high-risk group exhibits \na pronounced immunosuppressive phenotype. The study identified 2 additional \nfactors that contribute to the prognosis of cervical cancer: CPE and PGK1. These \nfactors have been shown to be significantly associated with poor clinical \noutcomes. In addition, we have identified 2 drugs that may target CPE and PGK1, \nnamely Z-LLNle-CHO and OSU-03-012. The discovery of these drugs has opened up a \nnew potential pathway for overcoming resistance to immunotherapy.

Despite advancements in treatment, drug \nresistance and limited therapeutic efficacy persist, underscoring the urgent \nneed for novel and mechanistically informed therapeutic strategies. Identifying \ngenetically supported drug targets may accelerate the development of precision \ntherapies in NSCLC.\nMETHODS: We implemented an integrative multi-omics framework combining \nsingle-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), genome-wide association studies (GWAS), \nand molecular quantitative trait locus (QTL) datasets including expression \n(eQTL), protein (pQTL), and DNA methylation (mQTL) QTLs. Druggable candidates \nwere systematically evaluated using a suite of Mendelian randomization (MR) \napproaches-including summary data-based MR (SMR), generalized SMR (GSMR), and \ngenetic risk score (GRS) analysis. Epigenetic regulation and downstream \nsignaling were further explored through mediation MR analysis.\nRESULTS: C4BPA, a complement-regulatory macromolecule, emerged as a risk factor \nfor NSCLC across multiple MR models, with consistent findings validated at both \ntranscriptomic and proteomic levels. Epigenetic activation of C4BPA via DNA \nmethylation was observed, and C4BPA expression was shown to promote NSCLC \nprogression through the inflammatory chemokine CCL8 signaling axis. Sensitivity \nanalyses confirmed the robustness of association inference.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings identify C4BPA as a genetically validated and \nbiologically plausible therapeutic target for NSCLC. This study demonstrates the \npower of integrating single-cell transcriptomics with population-scale omics and \nassociation inference to uncover actionable targets, offering a scalable \nframework for advancing precision oncology in lung cancer.\n\n© 2025.

Adipose tissue \n(AT) actively contributes to CRC progression and cachexia. Here, we investigated \nmolecular crosstalk between tumor cells and different visceral AT depots \n(normal, intra- and peri-tumoral), focusing on metabolic and (epi)genetic \nalterations. Using WGS analysis, we explored VAT role in CRC progression, \ndemonstrating how its proximity to the tumor impacts metabolic and phenotypic \nchanges. Intra-VAT (within 5 cm of lesion), closest to the tumor, underwent \nsignificant metabolic remodeling, characterized by upregulation of markers of \nthe white-brown AT transition (UCP-1, TMEM26), lipid metabolism (PON3) and a \nreduction in adipocyte turnover (Pref-1, adiponectin). Peri-VAT (within 15 cm) \nand HVAT (over 15 cm) exhibited progressively fewer alterations, suggesting a \ngradient effect of tumor on surrounding AT. Intra-VAT displayed increased \nfibrosis (TGF-β, collagen) and cachexia-related markers (IL-8), and mutations in \nkey oncogenes (KRAS, HLA, MET), highlighting a direct interaction between tumor \ncells and AT driving CRC progression. Mutations in genes such as KRAS, HLA, and \nPIK3CA were shared between CRC and its Intra-VAT, indicating potential \nbiomarkers for tumor progression and immune evasion. miRNA analysis revealed \nupregulation of miR-21 and miR-92a in Intra-VAT, with circulating miR-92a \ncorrelating with increased body fat and decreased lean mass in CRC patients, \nsuggesting their involvement in both local metabolic remodeling and systemic \nchanges. Altered PON3 DNA methylation patterns were also observed, correlating \nwith metabolic parameters. Our findings underscore AT's critical role in the CRC \nmicroenvironment as an active player in CRC progression and cachexia. Metabolic \nand genetic alterations decreased in VAT with increasing distance from the \ntumor. Intra-VAT may serve as a critical therapeutic target and biomarker for \nCRC progression, impacting surgical and postoperative strategies. Future studies \nshould focus on targeting tumor-adipose crosstalk to improve treatment outcomes, \nincluding experimental validation of the identified genetic alterations and \ninvestigation of their functional roles in tumor progression and immune evasion.\n\n© 2025.

The sensitivity and specificity of BMP4 bs-NGS for classifying \nhigh-methylation cases were 0.612 and 0.887, respectively. For PTPN11-mutant \npatients (N = 40), the sensitivity was 0.667 and the specificity was 0.842. \nSurvival analysis indicated that patients with high BMP4 methylation (BMP4h) had \nlower 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rates than those with normal BMP4 \nmethylation (BMP4n).

The most common molecular defect associated with \nBeckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS), a condition linked to overgrowth and tumours, \nis the loss of methylation of the KCNQ1OT1-TSS gDMR located on chromosome \n11p15.5 (also known as IC2 LoM). Approximately one-third of BWS patients with \nIC2 LoM exhibit multi-locus imprinting disturbances (MLID). While \nmaternal-effect variants in proteins of the oocyte subcortical maternal complex \n(SCMC) have been linked to MLID, the underlying mechanisms and health impact of \nthis epigenetic disturbance remain unclear.\nRESULTS: We used the Infinium EPIC methylation array to investigate whole-genome \nCpG methylation in 64 BWS patients with IC2 LoM and 37 control subjects. We \ndistinguished two patient groups, one with a variable methylation level of 24 \ngDMRs and the other with single-locus IC2 LoM. We observed that the mothers of \nthe former patient group carried more variants in maternal-effect genes than \nthose of the latter group, and 50% of them, but none of the latter group had \nvariants in the SCMC genes. Additionally, in the former group, the mothers were \nolder at the time of pregnancy, and the patients showed higher variation in \nmethylation levels of thousands of CpGs located in non-imprinted loci, including \nprotochaderins and cancer-associated genes. We found no differences in clinical \nfeatures or in the incidence of assisted reproductive technology between the two \npatient groups. However, multiple affected siblings and recurrent miscarriages \nwere observed only among cases with biallelic maternal-effect SCMC gene \nvariants.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the BWS patients with MLID exhibit \nhighly variable methylation changes that affect both imprinted and non-imprinted \nloci in a seemingly stochastic manner throughout the genome. These findings \nsupport the hypothesis that MLID results from the interaction of maternal-effect \ngenes and environmental factors in aged oocytes, leading to disordered DNA \nmethylation in the whole genome. Future research should investigate whether and \nhow these epimutations impact the health of affected individuals, particularly \nin adulthood.\n\n© 2025.

The molecular characteristics and underlying mechanisms governing its \nmetastatic behaviour remain poorly understood. This study aimed to delineate \nmolecular distinctions between metastatic (Pm) and non-metastatic (Pn) primary \nECCC tumours, elucidate DNA methylation-mediated regulatory mechanisms driving \nmetastasis, and identify potential epigenetic biomarkers and therapeutic \ntargets.\nMETHODS: This multicentre study involved 51 individuals diagnosed with ECCC, \nleading to the establishment of two independent cohorts: a sequencing cohort (n \n= 35) for integrated whole-genome methylation and transcriptomic analysis, and a \ntissue microarray (TMA) cohort (n = 16) to validate key findings.\nFINDINGS: Tumours exhibiting metastasis were found to possess a profoundly \nimmunosuppressive tumour microenvironment (TME), evidenced by reduced density of \ntumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), especially within subsets of anti-tumour \nimmune cells. Further analysis highlighted differential hypermethylation events \nin Pm tumours that acted as crucial epigenetic switches regulating immune \nresponses. Specifically, methylation at ETS1-binding sites influenced ETS1 \nregulon activity, thus broadly regulating immune response processes. Epigenetic \nsilencing of key genes in the T cell receptor (TCR) signalling pathway, such as \nLCK, CD3E, and ZAP70, impaired T cell activation and inhibited the activity of \ninteracting immune pathways. Additionally, we developed a Lasso-derived \nmetastatic risk score model, incorporating TME features (TIL density) and \nepigenetic predictors (LCK methylation), which demonstrated strong predictive \nperformance (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.859).\nINTERPRETATION: This study illuminated the \"epigenetic-immune axis\" as a central \nregulatory mechanism driving ECCC metastasis. DNA methylation systematically \nsilenced immune response genes by targeting ETS1-binding sites and TCR \nsignalling components, thus reconstructing the immunosuppressive TME to \nfacilitate metastasis. The development of the metastatic risk score model and \nidentification of LCK as a potential therapeutic target provide valuable \nstrategies for precision treatment decisions and advancing targeted \nepigenetic-immune therapies in ECCC.\nFUNDING: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of \nChina, Joint Foundation Programme, Qingdao Municipal Science and Technology \nBureau Municipal Science, Shenzhen Science and Technology Programme, and the \nAffiliated Hospital of Qingdao University Young Investigator Fund.\n\nCopyright © 2025 The Author(s).

This phenomenon of aging acceleration occurs when \nbiological age exceeds chronological age and can be assessed by epigenetic clock \nestimation. As aging acceleration is known to occur in response to some \nenvironmental exposures as well as trauma, we hypothesized that World Trade \nCenter (WTC) exposures may have led to epigenetic aging acceleration. \nWTC-exposed women were selected from the World Trade Center Environmental Health \nCenter (WTC EHC) clinic, with peripheral blood collected during routine clinical \nmonitoring visits. The reference group was selected from the NYU Women's Health \nStudy (NYUWHS), a prospective cohort study that collected blood samples before \n9/11/2001. Epigenomes of WTC-exposed vs. unexposed women were profiled using the \nInfinium MethylationEPIC array. DNA-based epigenetic aging was estimated using \nHannum, Horvath, PhenoAge and GrimAge epigenetic clocks. Age acceleration was \ndefined as the residual from regressing estimated epigenetic age on \nchronological age. Ordinary least squares regression was used to investigate the \nrelationship between WTC exposure and accelerated aging. After adjustment for \nrace/ethnicity, smoking status, Body Mass Index (BMI), batch and cell type \ncomposition, WTC exposure was associated with epigenetic aging acceleration \nusing the Hannum epigenetic clock (βWTC Exposed vs. Unexposed: 3.789; p-value: \n<0.001). WTC exposure was also associated with epigenetic aging acceleration \nwhen using other epigenetic clock types (Horvath and PhenoAge, but not GrimAge), \nand when stratifying by breast cancer case (βWTC Exposed vs. Unexposed: 3.473; \np-value: <0.001) or cancer-free participant (βWTC Exposed vs. Unexposed: 4.369; \np-value: 0.001) status. Among all participants, having a breast cancer diagnosis \nwas statistically significantly associated with accelerated aging (βCancer vs. \ncancer-free: 1.658; p-value: 0.021). WTC exposure is statistically significantly \nassociated with epigenetic aging acceleration. This was true even after \nstratifying on cancer status. WTC exposure was positively associated with \nepigenetic aging acceleration in the overall cohort, among only those women who \nwere cancer-free, and among breast cancer cases.\n\n© 2025.

Although its pathogenic mechanism remains unclear, skin cell \nsenescence creates a microenvironment that promotes cancer development, with the \nmechanisms accelerating disease progression in arsenic-induced skin damage \nattracting significant attention. This study utilised previously collected skin \nsamples to evaluate the associations between skin senescence and damage \nindicators. According to the presence or absence of arsenic exposure, \nparticipants were divided into a reference group and an arsenic exposure group. \nAdditionally, the arsenic exposure group was further divided into a common \npathological changes group, a hyperkeratosis group, and a skin cancer group, \nbased on skin histopathological examination. Compared with the reference group, \nthe arsenic exposure group exhibited increased expression of \nsenescence-associated secretory phenotypes (IL-6 and IL-17) and shortened \nrelative telomere length (RTL). With increasing severity of skin damage, IL-6 \nand IL-17 levels progressively increased, while RTL progressively decreased. \nExamination of representative indicators of arsenic-induced skin damage \n(epithelial-mesenchymal transition [EMT] indicators) revealed decreased \nE-cadherin expression and increased vimentin expression. With increasing \nseverity of skin damage, E-cadherin expression progressively decreased, while \nvimentin expression progressively increased. Moreover, clear correlations were \nobserved between senescence-related markers (IL-6, IL-17, and RTL) and \narsenic-induced skin damage markers (E-cadherin, vimentin) in the human samples. \nIn vitro experiments demonstrated that arsenic induced lower expression of the \ntelomere-related gene PARP1, reducing its binding to TERF2 and weakening its \nrecruitment of BLM, thereby causing telomere dysfunction, promoting the \nsenescence of HaCaT cells, and resulting in EMT. Additionally, arsenic exposure \ninduced high expression of DNMT3, which mediated PARP1 hypermethylation and low \nexpression. Treatment with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor \n5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine restored PARP1 expression in arsenic-treated HaCaT cells, \nregulated telomere dysfunction, improved cellular senescence, and alleviated \nEMT. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying \narsenic-induced skin damage from an epigenetic and genetic perspective.\n\nCopyright © 2025 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Whether and how telomeres, on the other hand, influence TERT \nregulation is relatively less studied. We found TERT was transcriptionally \naltered depending on telomere length (TL). This resulted from TL-dependent \nbinding of TRF2 between telomeres and the TERT promoter. TERT promoter-bound \nTRF2 was non-telomeric and did not involve the looping of telomeres to the TERT \npromoter. Cell lines from different tissue types fibrosarcoma (HT1080), colon \ncancer (HCT116), and breast cancer (MDA-MB-231), engineered for either telomere \nelongation/shortening, gave an increase/decrease in TERT, respectively. \nMechanistically, we show TERT promoter-bound non-telomeric TRF2 recruits the \ncanonical PRC2-complex, inducing repressor histone H3K27-trimethylation in a \nTL-dependent fashion. This was further supported by TL-dependent promoter \nactivity from an exogenously inserted TERT reporter. Increase in TL over days \nfollowed by a gradual decline, resulted in activation followed by repression of \nTERT in a concerted manner, further implicating TL as a key factor for TERT \nregulation. Notably, on reprogramming primary fibroblasts to induced pluripotent \nstem cells (iPSCs), TRF2 loss from the TERT promoter was evident along with \ntelomere elongation and TERT upregulation. Conversely, on telomere shortening in \niPSCs, TERT promoter-bound TRF2 was restored with a marked reduction in TERT, \nfurther supporting the causal role of TL in TERT transcription. Mechanisms of \ntight control of TERT by TL shown here are likely to have major implications in \ntelomere-related physiologies, particularly, cancer, ageing, and pluripotency.\n\nPlain Language Summary: Human cells typically have 23 pairs of structures known \nas chromosomes, each containing a unique set of genes that provides the \ninstructions needed to make proteins and other essential molecules found in the \nbody. At the end of each chromosome lies a region of repetitive DNA sequences, \nknown as the telomere, which protects the chromosome strands from damage or \ntangling. Every time a cell divides, some of the telomere repeats are cut off, \ncausing the telomeres to shorten. Specific enzymes known as telomerases can add \nthese repeats back on so that the telomeres do not become too short. As we age, \ntelomeres naturally shorten in length, but certain lifestyle factors can \naccelerate this process, leading to programmed cell death and contributing to \nvarious diseases, including cancers. In 2018, researchers showed that TRF2, a \nkey telomere protein, helps relay information about telomere length to various \nregulatory genes. However, it remained unclear whether TRF2 could directly \ncommunicate this information to the telomerase itself. Sengupta et al. – \nincluding several of the researchers from the 2018 study – set out to answer \nthis question by studying multiple human cancer cell lines with different \ntelomere lengths. They discovered that TRF2 acts like a messenger that interacts \nwith the telomerase gene TERT, in a length-dependent manner. When telomeres were \nlong, most TRF2 remained bound at the telomeres and did not interact with TERT, \nallowing continued telomerase activity and telomere elongation. By contrast, \nwhen telomeres were short, TRF2 was released from the telomeres and bound \ndirectly to the TERT promoter. There, together with a DNA structure called the \nG-quadruplex, TRF2 suppressed TERT expression and thereby limited further \ntelomere extension. In other words, shortened telomeres repressed TERT \nexpression, while elongated ones increased it. In this positive feedback–like \nreinforcement system, telomere length is signaled by the amount of free TRF2 \nprotein. When TERT expression is high and telomeres are long, less TRF2 is \navailable to bind the TERT promoter, reducing repression and thereby maintaining \nits expression. Conversely, when TERT expression is low and telomeres are short, \nmore TRF2 is available, reinforcing repression and sustaining the low-expression \nstate. Regulating telomere length is essential for healthy cell function, and \nits dysregulation is a hallmark of cancer. Sengupta et al. demonstrated that \nTRF2 plays a critical role in this process by feeding back information about \ntelomere length directly to the TERT gene. By further dissecting this feedback \nsystem and refining experimental tools, researchers may gain new insights into \ntelomere regulation in cancer and related diseases.\n\n© 2025, Sengupta et al.\n\nDOI: 10.7554/eLife.104045\nPMCID: PMC12483519\nPMID: 41026782 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: AS, SV, DS, RD, AM, SD, JJ, MY, SS, SB, SR, PP, \nAS, DK, AB, AS, SS, RM, SC No competing interests declared"

It was shown that the detection of \nmethylation in at least one of the three genes in tissue DNA samples allows for \nidentification of ovarian cancer with 98% sensitivity and 100% specificity (test \n> 0, AUC = 0.989).

Notable disease relevant \nassociations include IFN-γ specific transcript QTL at COVID-19 severity locus \nrs10735079, where allelic variation modulates context-specific splicing of OAS1, \nand at rs4072037, a risk allele for gastro-esophageal cancer, which associates \nwith context-specific splicing of MUC1.

However, the combined effects of AFB1 exposure and EBV \ninfection on the epigenetic landscape remain poorly understood. This study \ninvestigates the impact of AFB1 and EBV on histone post-translational \nmodifications (hPTMs) in Burkitt lymphoma (BL) cells through an integrative \napproach combining untargeted mass spectrometry-based profiling and a time-lapse \nexperimental design. Our results reveal subtle, yet reproducible and dynamic \nalterations in histone methylation and acetylation patterns over time in all \ncells. Specifically, AFB1 exposure induced an increase in H3K27me3 levels, which \nin the case of EBV infected cells, counteracts the decrease observed at baseline \ncompared to uninfected cells. Additionally, changes in acetylation patterns of \nH4 N-tail residues and key regulatory proteins suggest potential disruptions in \nchromatin accessibility and transcriptional regulation. Our correlation and \nnetwork-based analyses further highlight coordinated epigenetic shifts in \nresponse to AFB1, with key acetylation hubs emerging within the histone PTM \nprofile. Despite subtle differences, no significant divergence in overall hPTM \nresponses was detected between EBV-infected and uninfected cells, emphasizing \nthe subtlety of the EBV effect on AFB1 exposure. Future research should explore \nlocus-specific epigenetic changes and therapeutic interventions targeting hPTMs \nto mitigate cancer risk associated with AFB1 exposure and EBV infection.\n\nCopyright © 2025.

The aim of this study was to develop a prognostic model for \novarian cancer on the basis of crotonylation and to investigate the underlying \nmechanisms and potential of crotonylation for targeted therapy.\nMETHODS: We systematically analyzed single-cell RNA-seq and bulk transcriptomic \ndatasets from ovarian cancer patients. Cellular crotonylation activity was \nquantified using AUCell algorithm. Potential prognostic genes were identified \nthrough DEG analysis and Weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA), and \nthe associated molecular mechanisms were elucidated via Gene set enrichment \nanalysis (GSEA). An ovarian cancer prognosis model were constructed by \nintegrating machine learning algorithms. Immune microenvironment features were \nassessed using CIBERSORT, ESTIMATE and TIDE algorithms, with drug sensitivity \npredicted via genomics of drug sensitivity in cancer.\nRESULTS: The ovarian cancer microenvironment is characterized by abundant immune \ncell infiltration, with significant differences in crotonylation levels among 7 \ncell subtypes. We identified 451 key crotonylation-related genes. The \ncrotonylation risk score (RS) model demonstrated robust prognostic performance. \nHigh-RS groups showed immunosuppressive characteristics: decreased follicular \nhelper T cells and activated NK cells, concomitant with M2 macrophage \nenrichment. Elevated RS was associated with increased stromal activation, as \nindicated by a higher ESTIMATE score, and enhanced immune evasion potential, \nreflected by an elevated TIDE score. Notably, high-RS patients exhibited \nupregulated PDL1 and CD40, suggesting increased immunotherapy susceptibility. \nPharmacogenomic analysis identified vinblastine with differential sensitivity, \nproviding actionable targets for RS-stratified therapy.\nCONCLUSION: We elucidated the significant impact of crotonylation on the ovarian \ncancer microenvironment and prognosis. We developed and validated a novel \nprognostic model for ovarian cancer that can serve as a tool for predicting \npatient outcomes and characterizing the immune microenvironment. These findings \nenhance our understanding of the role of crotonylation in ovarian cancer and \nestablish a robust framework for developing therapeutic strategies targeting \ncrotonylation.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Li, Wu, Tao and Guo.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2025.1596080\nPMCID: PMC12457283\nPMID: 41000388 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest."

Cytotoxic T \nlymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), an inhibitory receptor regulating \nT-cell homeostasis and maintaining self-tolerance, has emerged as a key target \nfor immune screening and therapeutics in autoimmunity and cancer. CTLA-4 is \nassociated with various autoimmune diseases; however, the relationship between \nCTLA-4 polymorphisms and AAV in the Guangxi population of China remains \nunderexplored. In the present case-control study, we evaluated the effects of \nCTLA-4 polymorphisms on AAV susceptibility in the Guangxi population of China.\nMETHODS: A total of 343 patients with AAV and 343 healthy controls were \nrecruited. High-throughput sequencing was used to genotype CTLA4 variants, and \nlogistic regression analysis was used to assess their association with AAV risk. \nThe relationship between the haplotypes of CTLA4 single-nucleotide polymorphisms \n(SNPs) and AAV risk was assessed using the SHEsis platform.\nRESULTS: Three CTLA4 SNPs- rs62182595, rs16840252, and rs5742909- showed \nsignificant association with AAV susceptibility. The ATT and GCC haplotypes, \ncomprising these loci, were also associated with an increased risk of AAV.\nDISCUSSION: These findings suggest that CTLA4 polymorphisms (rs62182595, \nrs16840252, and rs5742909) may contribute to AAV susceptibility in the Guangxi \npopulation and offer preliminary markers for risk assessment, early diagnosis, \nand personalized management of AAV.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Bu, Yang, He and Xue.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2025.1631088\nPMCID: PMC12457943\nPMID: 41000380 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest."

To improve survival prediction for HER2-positive breast cancer by \nintegrating histopathological, molecular, and clinical data using a multimodal \ntransformer framework.Approach. We propose a multimodal transformer framework \nfor breast cancer survival prediction using HER2 stratified (SurvMBC), a \nfoundation model-enhanced architecture that fuses three data modalities: \nwhole-slide images, clinical narratives, and molecular features. Tumor \nmicroenvironment features are extracted using a pathology language and image \npre-training (PLIP), clinical narratives are processed with BioBERT, and miRNA \nexpression plus DNA methylation data are embedded using Gen2Vec. These \nrepresentations are integrated through a cross-modal transformer with attention \nmechanisms for survival prediction.Main results. The model was evaluated on \n1,095 HER2-positive breast cancer patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas. SurvMBC \nachieved a concordance index (C-index) of 0.857 (95% CI: 0.834, 0.880), a low \nintegrated Brier score, and a strong inverse negative binomial log-likelihood. \nRisk stratification based on model outputs significantly separated high- and \nlow-risk groups (log-rankp< 0.01) and showed strong associations with tumor \nstage, grade, and hormone receptor status (allp< 0.05).Significance. SurvMBC \ndemonstrates the effectiveness of multimodal fusion in addressing tumor \nheterogeneity and improving prognostic accuracy.

Levels of ZNF582 and ASCL1 gene methylation were quantified \nusing real-time PCR on anal smears collected at the time of inclusion.\nFINDINGS: Overall, 514 anal smears were contributive for host-cell DNA \nmethylation analysis. Patients' mean age was 50.8 years and 40% were women. \nAmong the 41% who were living with HIV, 91% were men. Median follow-up duration \nwas 48 months, and 22 patients (4%) developed anal cancer during follow-up. \nHigher methylation levels of ZNF582 and ASCL1 were significantly associated with \nhigh-grade squamous cell intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) cytology, p16-Ki67 \ndual-staining positivity, and high-risk HPV and HPV16 positivity on the same \nanal smear. Both methylation markers showed an AUC of 0.72 for discrimination \nbetween HSIL and non-HSIL cytology on the same anal smear. Higher methylation \nlevels of both markers were significantly associated with evolution to anal \ncancer in univariate and multivariable analyses adjusted for age and HIV status \n(p < 0.001). When assessing the AUC over 1 and 3 years of follow-up, methylation \nmarkers demonstrated superior predictive value for anal cancer compared to other \nmarkers.\nINTERPRETATION: We have demonstrated the predictive value of host-cell DNA \nmethylation marker levels in anal smears with regard to evolution to anal cancer \nin a very high-risk population.\nFUNDING: This study was funded by the Agence Nationale de Recherche sur le Sida \net les hépatites virales (ANRS) I Maladies Infectieuses Emergentes.\n\nCopyright © 2025 The Author(s).

However, causality remains unclear due to confounding in \nobservational studies and lack of human genetic evidence.ObjectiveTo address \nthis, we conducted a Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using genome-wide \nassociation data exclusively from individuals of European ancestry.MethodsWe \nobtained genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics for EHMT2 \nexpression, AD (n = 39,106), 211 gut microbiota taxa, and colorectal cancer \n(CRC; n = 6847) from the IEU OpenGWAS and FinnGen databases. MR was used to \nevaluate the causal effects, with CRC as a positive control. Five regression \nmodels were utilized to evaluate the causal effects, and two-step MR assessed \nthe mediating role of gut microbiota. Sensitivity analyses tested result \nrobustness.ResultsInverse-variance weighted (IVW) analyses showed that EHMT2 \ninhibition was associated with reduced risks of CRC [odds ratio (OR) = 0.7850, \n95% CI: 0.6782-0.9086, p = 0.0012], and AD (OR = 0.8585, 95% CI: 0.8056-0.9148, \np < 0.0001). EHMT2 inhibition also influenced the abundance of 67 gut microbiota \ntaxa. Among them, 17 taxa were linked to AD risk, with four showing shared \ncausal associations. Notably, three of them (family Lactobacillaceae id.1836, \ngenus Dialister id.2183, and unknown genus id.959) had positive mediating \neffects.ConclusionsEHMT2 inhibition may play protective roles in AD via \nmodulating specific gut microbiota, particularly three key taxa. These findings \nhighlight a potential microbiota-mediated epigenetic mechanism in AD \npathogenesis, warranting further mechanistic and translational studies.\n\nDOI: 10.1177/13872877251372945\nPMID: 40984004 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: Declaration of conflicting interestsThe authors \ndeclared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, \nauthorship, and/or publication of this article."

Epigenetic clocks, which can be estimated from levels of DNA \nmethylation in a subset of cytosine-phosphate-guanine loci in the genome, have \nbeen proposed as a promising biological age estimator. The objectives of this \nscoping review are to systematically scope the literature on the effects of \nstress on biological ageing measured by epigenetic clocks in family caregivers \nof patients diagnosed with cancer.\nMETHODS AND ANALYSIS: This review will be conducted following Joanna Briggs \nInstitute methodology based on Arksey and O'Malley's and Levac et al's framework \nand reported using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and \nMeta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for scoping reviews. Studies will be included \nif (1) the studies focus on unpaid family caregivers of patients diagnosed with \ncancer; (2) caregivers are adults (≥18 years of age) and (3) the study measured \nepigenetic clocks. The search will encompass literature and peer-reviewed \nliterature in PubMed/MEDLINE (National Library of Medicine), Embase (Elsevier), \nCochrane CENTRAL (Wiley & Sons), Web of Science: Core Collection (Clarivate \nAnalytics), CINAHL (EBSCOhost) and PsycInfo (American Psychological \nAssociation).\nETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Since the scoping review methodology focuses on \npublished literature, this study does not require ethical approval.

However, how neuroblastoma cells switch cellular states during \ntherapy remains largely unknown, and how to eradicate neuroblastoma regardless \nof its cell state is a clinical challenge. To better understand the cellular \nplasticity of neuroblastoma in chemoresistance, we define the transcriptomic and \nepigenetic map of adrenergic and mesenchymal types of neuroblastomas using human \nand murine models treated with indisulam, a selective RBM39 degrader. We show \nthat cancer cells not only undergo a bidirectional switch between adrenergic and \nmesenchymal states, but also acquire additional cellular states, reminiscent of \nthe developmental pliancy of neural crest cells. These cell state alterations \nare coupled with epigenetic reprogramming and dependency switching of cell \nstate-specific transcription factors, epigenetic modifiers, and targetable \nkinases. Through targeting RNA splicing, indisulam induces an inflammatory tumor \nmicroenvironment and enhances the anticancer activity of natural killer cells. \nThe combination of indisulam with anti-GD2 immunotherapy results in a durable, \ncomplete response in high-risk transgenic neuroblastoma models, providing an \ninnovative, rational therapeutic approach to eradicate tumor cells regardless of \ntheir potential to switch cell states.\n\n© 2025.

Its \ndevelopment is associated with multifactors, which include viral hepatitis, \nmetabolic syndrome, lifestyle factors, and dysregulation of many genetic and \nepigenetic signalling pathways. MicroRNAs play the main role in gene regulation \nin eukaryotic cells, which functions primarily through RISC, and their \ndysregulations with enhanced expression of RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) \nactivity contribute to HCC pathogenesis. Staphylococcal nuclease \ndomain-containing protein 1 (SND1), a core component of the RISC machinery, acts \nas an oncogene promoting tumor growth, invasion, and angiogenesis in HCC. \nFurthermore, aberrant telomerase activation, largely attributed to elevated \nexpression of its catalytic subunit of human telomerase reverse transcriptase \n(hTERT), is a hallmark of approximately 90 % of cancers. Short-chain fatty acid \n(SCFA), Sodium Butyrate (NaBu), are gut microbiota-derived metabolites with \nemerging anti-cancer properties. NaBu acts as an HDAC inhibitor, exhibiting \nanti-proliferative, pro-apoptotic, and anti-inflammatory effects in various \ncancer models. In this study, we investigate the novel molecular mechanism by \nwhich NaBu regulates SND1 meditated hTERT expression in HCC and assess its \nanti-tumor efficacy through in-vitro cellular models.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

This study \ninvestigates the prognostic value of efferocytosis-related genes and their role \nin colon cancer progression and immune modulation. A prognostic signature relied \non efferocytosis-related genes was developed using univariate Cox and least \nabsolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analyses. Immune \ninfiltration, immune checkpoint expression, and tumor microenvironment \ncharacteristics were analyzed using single-sample gene set enrichment analysis \n(ssGSEA), ESTIMATE, and tumor immunophenotype (TIP) frameworks. S1PR5 was \nknocked down in SW1116 and SW620 cells. The effect of S1PR5 on colon cancer \ngrowth and macrophage regulation in vivo and in vitro. Colon cancer patients \nwere stratified into high- and low-risk groups, with high-risk patients \ndemonstrating significantly worse survival outcomes. S1PR5, a key gene in the \nmodel, was markedly overexpressed in colon cancer tumors and correlated with \nadvanced clinical stages, poor survival outcomes, and diminished responses to \nimmunotherapy. Furthermore, S1PR5 knockdown could inhibit colon cancer cell \nactivity and increase macrophage polarization from M0 to M1. Our research \ndeveloped an efferocytosis-related gene prognostic model and identified S1PR5 as \na key biomarker. S1PR5 showed significant associations with advanced clinical \nstages, immunosuppressive microenvironments, and unfavorable survival outcomes, \nunderscoring its potential as both a prognostic marker and a therapeutic target \nin colon cancer.\n\n© 2025.

Nipple \naspirate fluid (NAF), a noninvasive liquid biopsy from at-risk women, contains \nnucleic acid and protein biomarkers from adjacent cancer cells, showing promise \nfor breast cancer (BrC) detection. However, despite its potential, the \napplication of cfDNA in NAF for BrC screening is still underexplored. Here, we \nreport a proof-of-concept study for using cfDNA bisulfite sequencing (cfBS) to \nassess tumor DNA methylation signatures from NAF samples. For four healthy \nindividuals and three BrC patients, cfBS achieved greater than 20× sequencing \ndepth with an average coverage of 26.5× on the genome. A total of 7471 \ndifferentially methylated regions were identified, with significant \nhypermethylation in BrC samples compared to healthy controls. Gene set \nenrichment analysis indicated that the differentially methylated genes (DMGs) \nwere significantly associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). By \ndeveloping a novel EMT scoring metric, we found that BrC samples had more of a \nmesenchymal phenotype than samples from healthy individuals. CDH1, WNT2, and \nTRIM29 were hypermethylated near the promoter region, while COL5A2 was \nhypermethylated in the coding region. The DNA methylation and EMT changes were \nvalidated through The Cancer Genome Atlas Breast Invasive Carcinoma study, which \nconfirmed that DMGs were associated with gene expression change and that our \nmethylation-based EMT score reliably distinguished tumors from healthy controls. \nOur findings support the utilization of the NAF cfDNA cfBS methylation profile \nfor noninvasive BrC screening and pave the way for enhanced early detection of \nthis disease.\n\nDOI: 10.3390/ijms26178723\nPMCID: PMC12429146\nPMID: 40943642 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare no conflict of interest."

By \nsystematically integrating multi-omics databases, including transcriptomics and \nsingle-cell transcriptomics, we identified overlapping targets between \nBPA-associated molecules and tumor-related genes. Functional enrichment revealed \nthat these targets converge on key oncogenic pathways, includingcellular \nmetabolic reprogramming (particularly glycolysis), tumor microenvironment \nremodeling via cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) activation, and dysregulation \nof cell cycle progression. Molecular docking verified strong binding affinity \nbetween BPA and key targets. Survival analysis linked GAPDH and HSP90AA1 in ICC, \nCDKN1A, CEBPB, and EGR1 in CRC, and DCN and CXCL12 in esophageal cancer to poor \nsurvival rates, highlighting their potential as prognostic biomarkers. Our \nfindings demonstrate that BPA promotes gastrointestinal carcinogenesisthrough \ndisrupting energy metabolism, activating CAFs to remodel the tumor \nmicroenvironment, and enhancing cancer cell proliferation. This multi-level \nevidence advances the risk assessment of BPA and identifies potential targets \nfor prevention and therapy of BPA-linked gastrointestinal cancers. Environmental \nImplication. In addition to well-documented role in promoting endocrine-related \ndiseases, the mechanisms by which hazardous compound bisphenol A (BPA) \ncontributes to other pathological conditions must not be overlooked. Through \nsystematic integration of biological evidence chains, this study revealed BPA's \ntriple carcinogenic mechanism involving interference with cell cycle \ncheckpoints, remodeling of tumor microenvironment stroma, and disruption of \nepigenetic regulation, thereby providing a novel target system for preventing \nenvironmental toxicant-induced gastrointestinal tumors.\n\nCopyright © 2025 The Authors.

Electronic address: lizhong@zjhu.edu.cn.\n\nBACKGROUND: Breast cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease with high morbidity \nand mortality rates. Despite the availability of various treatments, a \nsignificant number of patients still face a high probability of recurrence or \nmetastasis, which severely impacts their survival status. Traditional prognostic \nmethods based on single-modality data and machine learning algorithms often fail \nto adequately capture the complex biological relationships and heterogeneous \ncharacteristics of breast cancer, leading to suboptimal prognostic performance. \nTherefore, there is an urgent need for a more accurate and effective method to \npredict the risk of recurrence and metastasis in breast cancer prognosis.\nMETHODS: In this study, we propose a novel method termed PCGMMF for breast \ncancer prognostic analysis. This method integrates histopathological images, \nclinical data, gene expression data, and DNA methylation data through multimodal \nfusion. We leverage a pre-trained Vision-LSTM model based on transfer learning \nto extract features from histopathological images. Additionally, we design a \ncomprehensive feature selection strategy that includes support vector machine \n(SVM), Mantel test, and correlation analysis to filter features from gene \nexpression data and DNA methylation data. Furthermore, to address the high \nheterogeneity of breast cancer and the independence and intersectionality of \nmultimodal features, we propose a bidirectional attention and self-attention \nbased enhanced multimodal feature fusion module called BSAMF.\nRESULTS: Through a series of experiments, we evaluate the performance of PCGMMF. \nWhen predicting the recurrence and metastasis risk of breast cancer prognosis, \nPCGMMF achieves an accuracy of 0.903 and an AUC value of 0.924, outperforming \nother state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we provide an interpretability \nanalysis of highly significant regions from histopathological images, which can \nserve as a reference for clinical practice.\nCONCLUSION: PCGMMF offers a robust and innovative solution for breast cancer \nprognostic analysis by effectively integrating multimodal data and utilizing \nadvanced deep learning techniques. It can effectively conduct breast cancer \nprognostic analysis and provide significant references for personalized \nprecision treatment and clinical practice.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

Ex-vivo inhibition of Gcn5 \nwas performed in aortic rings from diet-induced obese and control mice. \nChromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed to investigate the epigenetic \nregulation of Nox2 promoter. In parallel, Gcn5/Nox2 expression was assessed by \nreal-time PCR in vascular specimens isolated from obese patients and age-matched \nhealthy controls. Endothelial-dependent vasodilation was also assessed in human \nvessels.\nRESULTS: PA increased Gcn5 gene expression in HAECs. Gcn5 upregulation was \nassociated with increased expression of the pro-oxidant enzyme Nox2. \nInterestingly, either Gcn5 inhibition or gene silencing prevented PA-induced \nNox2 upregulation and oxidative stress accumulation. ChiP assay showed increased \nGcn5 occupancy and enhanced histone 3 acetylation of lysine 14 (H3K14ac) on Nox2 \npromoter. In aortic rings from obese mice, pharmacological inhibition of Gcn5 by \nCPTH2 rescued endothelial-dependent vasorelaxation as compared to vehicle. \nFinally, Gcn5 was increased in vessels from obese patients and correlated with \nNox2 expression and endothelial dysfunction.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings shed light on the importance of epigenetic regulation \nin obesity and pinpoint Gcn5 as a therapeutic target to prevent endothelial \ndysfunction in cardiometabolic disease.\n\n© 2025.

The SWI/SNF complexes exhibit the ability to \nselectively replace subunits, thereby enabling a wide range of epigenetic \nfunctions. As an accessory subunit of this complex, ARID1B is critically \ninvolved in modulating chromatin accessibility and transcriptional regulation. \nNevertheless, its precise contribution to TNBC pathogenesis remains poorly \nunderstood.\nMETHODS: ARID1B expression levels in TNBC were detected using immunofluorescence \nand real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). To investigate \nARID1B's biological functions in TNBC, a series of in vitro assays were \nconducted, complemented by subcutaneous tumor xenograft models. Mass \nspectrometry analysis was employed to identify ARID1B-interacting proteins, \nwhile RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed to screen downstream target genes \nregulated by ARID1B. The transcriptional regulatory mechanism of ZNF382 mediated \nby ARID1B was further validated through dual-luciferase reporter assays and \nChromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR. To determine if ZNF382 knockdown \ncould reverse the cellular effects of ARID1B, SMARCC2, and SMARCB1 inhibition, \nfunctional rescue experiments were conducted.\nRESULTS: We identified ARID1B as a notable E3 ubiquitin ligase gene associated \nwith breast cancer prognosis, particularly serving as a risk prognostic factor \nin TNBC. Contrary to its previously reported function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, \nwe observed that ARID1B transcriptionally represses ZNF382 by forming a novel \nSWI/SNF complex with SMARCC2 and SMARCB1. This newly assembled complex promotes \nTNBC proliferation and migration, highlighting a previously unrecognized \nmechanism of ARID1B in cancer development.\nCONCLUSIONS: This research enhances the understanding of the intricate roles \nplayed by SWI/SNF complex components in TNBC and bridges the gap between the \nstructural specificity of SWI/SNF assembly and the progression of cancer. These \nfindings could potentially unveil novel therapeutic targets for TNBC, thereby \nadvancing the development of more efficacious treatment approaches for this \nhighly aggressive malignancy.\n\n© 2025.

Prolonged hypoxia is associated with the gradual adaptation of tumor \ncells to low oxygen levels, leading to the enhanced survival, increased \nmetastatic potential, and development of resistance to anticancer therapies. The \naim of this study was to investigate the mechanisms underlying adaptation of \nbreast cancer cell to prolonged hypoxia and maintenance of the hypoxia-tolerant \nphenotype. Using long-term culturing under low oxygen conditions (1% O2), we \nestablished hypoxia-adapted sublines of luminal (MCF-7) and triple-negative \n(MDA-MB-231) breast cancer cells, characterized by a stable growth in a hypoxic \nenvironment. The acquisition of hypoxia tolerance was accompanied by the \nactivation of the HIF-1α-dependent transcription factor STAT3 and persistent \noverexpression of Snail, a key downstream effector of STAT3. The maintenance and \nstabilization of hypoxia-tolerant phenotype are mediated by miR-181a-2, which \ntargets the STAT3/Snail signaling axis in the resistant cells. Analysis of DNA \nmethylation status revealed no significant changes in the expression or activity \nof DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) in the hypoxia-adapted cells. However, \npharmacological inhibition of DNMTs using decitabine, as well as DNMT knockdown, \nincreased cell sensitivity to hypoxia and partially reversed the \nhypoxia-resistant phenotype, which was accompanied by the activation of \npro-apoptotic p53 signaling. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the \nacquired hypoxia tolerance in breast cancer cells is mediated, at least in part, \nby the activation of the miR-181a-2/STAT3/Snail signaling pathway. Furthermore, \nthe use of demethylating agents may represent a promising therapeutic approach \nto targeting hypoxia-tolerant cancer cell populations.\n\nDOI: 10.1134/S0006297925601315\nPMID: 40886387 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

However, so far, there is no study in the literature that has \nexplored genetic factors through which T2D drive the development and progression \nof KC. Therefore, this study attempted to explore T2D- and KC-causing shared key \ngenes (sKGs) for revealing shared pathogenesis and therapeutic drugs as their \ncommon treatments.\nMETHODS: The integrated bioinformatics and system biology approaches were \nutilized in this study. The statistical LIMMA approach was used based web-tool \nGEO2R to detect differentially expressed genes (DEGs) through transcriptomics \nanalysis. Then upregulated and downregulated DEGs for T2D and KC were combined \nto obtained shared DEGs (sDEGs) between T2D and KC. The STRING database was used \nto construct the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of sDEGs. Then \nCytohubba plugin-in Cytoscape were used in the PPI network to disclose the sKGs \nbased on different topological measures. The RegNetwork database was used in \nNetworkAnalyst to analyze co-regulatory networks of sKGs with transcription \nfactors (TFs) and micro-RNAs to identify key TFs and miRNAs as the \ntranscriptional and post-transcriptional regulators of sKGs, respectively. \nAutoDock Vina is a tool used for molecular docking. ADME/T properties were 24 \nassessed using pkCSM and SwissADME.\nRESULTS: At first, 74 shared DEGs (sDEGs) were identified that can distinguish \nboth KC and T2D patients from control samples. Through protein-protein \ninteraction (PPI) network analysis, top-ranked 6 sDEGs (CD74, TFRC, CREB1, MCL1, \nSCARB1 and JUN) were detected as the sKGs that drive both KC and T2D development \nand progression. The most common sKG 'CD74' is associated with key pathways, \nsuch as NF-κB signaling transduction, apoptotic processes, B cell proliferation. \nDifferential expression patterns of sKGs validated by independent datasets of \nNCBI database for T2D and TCGA and GTEx databases for KC. Furthermore, sKGs were \nfound to be significant at several CpG sites in DNA methylation studies. \nRegulatory network analysis identified three TFs proteins (SMAD5, ATF1 and \nNR2F1) and two miRNAs (hsa-mir-1-3p and hsa-mir-34a-5p) as the regulators of \nsKGs. The enrichment analysis of sKGs with KEGG-pathways and Gene Ontology (GO) \nterms revealed some crucial shared pathogenetic mechanisms (sPM) between two \ndiseases. Finally, sKGs-guided four potential therapeutic drug molecules \n(Imatinib, Pazopanib hydrochloride, Sorafenib and Glibenclamide) were \nrecommended as the common therapies for KC with T2D.\nCONCLUSION: The results of this study may be useful resources for the diagnosis \nand therapy of KC with the co-existence of T2D.\n\nCopyright: © 2025 Ahmmed et al.

This study investigated DNA methylation (DNAm) patterns \nand associated pathways in PWH with and without prior TB infection. DNAm was \nanalyzed in blood samples from 30 PWH (10 with prior latent TB infection [LTBI], \n10 with previous successfully treated active TB, and 10 with no TB) using the \nIllumina MethylationEPIC BeadChip covering over 850,000 CpG sites. Epigenetic \nage was estimated, and age acceleration was calculated. Differentially \nmethylated CpGs (dmCpGs) and regions (DMRs) were identified, and functional \nenrichment analyses for Gene Ontology, KEGG pathways, PANTHER database, and gene \nset enrichment analysis (DisGeNET, dbGaP) were performed. Statistical \nsignificance was set at a false discovery rate (FDR) of < 0.05. PWH exhibited \nsignificant epigenetic age acceleration, with a mean of 19.32 ± 10.82 years \ngreater than chronological age. This accelerated aging was more pronounced in \nindividuals with any prior TB infection (21.60 ± 12.03 years) compared to those \nwithout TB (17.42 ± 9.38 years). In the prior active TB vs. no TB comparison, \n7461 dmCpGs were identified, corresponding to 150 DMRs (p < 0.05), with top \nassociated genes including GRAMD1C (hypomethylation), DPP6 (hypermethylation), \nand HDAC4 (hypomethylation). In the LTBI vs. no TB comparison, 8598 dmCpGs were \nobserved, corresponding to 39 DMRs (p < 0.05), associated with genes such as \nPLEKHG5 (hypermethylation), STK32C (hypermethylation), and SPATC1L. When \ncomparing any prior TB (active or latent) to no TB, 71,774 dmCpGs and 14 DMRs \nwere identified, including genes like PLEKHG5, KCNN3, and BRSK2. Pathway \nanalyses of prior TB (active or latent) vs. no TB revealed enrichment in \nneurogenesis, neuron differentiation, axon guidance, and neuroactive ligand \nsignaling. Additional enriched pathways included those related to platelet \nactivation, vascular muscle contraction, and chemokine signaling. Cancer-related \npathways such as proteoglycans in cancer, small cell lung cancer, prostate \ncancer, breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and thyroid cancer were also \nenriched. PANTHER analysis showed consistent enrichment in the Wnt signaling \npathway and inflammation-mediated pathways across compared groups. DisGeNET \nanalysis linked prior TB DNAm patterns to lymphoid leukemia, while dbGaP \nanalysis identified associations with phenotypes like asthma, body mass index, \ntunica media, and lymphocyte count. Prior TB infection in PWH is associated with \ndistinct DNAm changes in pathways related to neural function, cardiovascular \nhealth, and cancer risk, and is linked to more pronounced epigenetic age \nacceleration, suggesting epigenetic mechanisms for TB-related long-term \ncomplications.\n\n© 2025.

However, alcohol's \nprognostic impact on CRC survival is unclear, and self-reported intake is \nlimited by bias. This population-based cohort study evaluated blood DNA \nmethylation-based alcohol scores as objective prognostic tools in 2,129 CRC \npatients from Germany's DACHS study (2003-2021; median follow-up: 10 years). \nParticipants were recruited from 22 hospitals in Southwest Germany, including \nnon-metastatic (n = 1757) and metastatic (n = 372) patients with complete \nmethylation and alcohol data. All three assessed methylation scores (3-CpG, \n450-CpG, 144-CpG) correlated with self-reported lifetime/recent alcohol intake \n(Spearman's r: 0.29-0.36; p < 0.0001), particularly recent consumption. In \nnon-metastatic patients, self-reported alcohol consumption showed a J-shaped \nmortality risk, with elevated risks in heavy drinkers and abstainers. A similar \ndose-response pattern was observed for the 3-CpG methylation score, which showed \nconsistent and robust associations with increased overall mortality (adjusted \nhazard ratio [aHR] per standard deviation increase: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.11-1.25), \nnon-CRC-related mortality (1.22, 1.13-1.32), and CRC-specific mortality (1.12, \n1.00-1.25). The 450-CpG score was associated with overall mortality (1.07, \n1.00-1.15), non-CRC-related mortality (1.14, 1.05-1.23), and alcohol \nconsumption-related mortality (1.59, 1.17-2.16). These findings highlight the \npotential utility of DNA methylation-based alcohol scores, especially the 3-CpG \nand the 450-CpG scores, as prognostic tools for CRC outcomes. Such biomarkers \nmay provide a more objective measure of alcohol exposure and complement \nself-reported data in risk stratification and clinical decision-making, though \nfurther validation is warranted before clinical implementation.\n\n© 2025 The Author(s).

HBQs exhibited a unique capacity to promote the conversion of \n5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). Thus, we propose that \na varied epigenetic landscape may serve as an essential initial molecular event \nin cancer development under HBQs stress. We investigated the global levels of \ncytosine modifications and revealed genome-wide alteration of 5mC and 5hmC \ninduced by HBQs in human bladder epithelial cells SV-HUC-1. The results showed \nthat the global level of 5hmC significantly increased after exposure to HBQs. \nHBQ exposure resulted in more hypo-methylated (39,365) and \nhyper-hydroxymethylated (26,053) sites, with 7441 overlapping sites, suggesting \nthe conversion of 5mC to 5hmC. The genes associated with hypo-differentially \nmethylated regions (hypo-DMRs) and hyper-differentially hydroxymethylated \nregions (hyper-DhMRs) were enriched in cancer-related pathways, such as the \nHippo signaling pathway, PI3K-AKT signaling pathway and Wnt signaling pathway. \nIn particular, three bladder cancer-related genes (CASC8, TTTY14, METRNL) \nassociated with hypo-DMRs or hyper-DhMRs exhibited significantly differential \nexpression. This study revealed epigenetic changes induced by HBQs and a \npotential association with the risk of bladder cancer.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Elsevier Ltd.

Previously, we developed a prognostic model \ncontaining five DNA methylation markers (NEFH, NEURL, GATA5, GREM1, and LAD1) \nand clinicopathological characteristics based on the TNM 3rd edition and Fuhrman \ngrading system. Here, we evaluated the effect of the recent ISUP/ 2022 WHO \nrevisions on our previous prognostic model by incorporating the new ISUP/WHO \nstandards, TNM 8th edition, and several novel prognostic factors (necrosis, \nlymphovascular invasion, sarcomatoid and rhabdoid features). Data from 308 ccRCC \ncases from the Netherlands Cohort Study were included for this study. \nClinicopathological factors, novel prognostic factors, and the five methylation \nmarkers were analyzed for their individual and combined prognostic value using \nKaplan-Meier analyses and Cox proportional hazard models. To compare models, the \nAkaike information criterion (AIC) and c-statistic were used. All evaluated \nfactors were statistically significantly associated with cause-specific \nsurvival. The clinical model using the ISUP and TNM 8th edition performed \nsimilarly when compared to the Fuhrman/TNM 3rd edition model (AIC 592, \nc-statistic 0.63 and AIC 595, c-statistic 0.62, respectively). After addition of \nthe five DNA methylation markers to the ISUP/TNM 8th model, this model was \nslightly improved (AIC 584, c-statistic 0.70). The addition of necrosis and \nlymphovascular invasion (LVI) did not further improve these results (AIC 586, \nc-statistic 0.71 and AIC 588, c-statistic 0.71, respectively). Despite the \nindividual prognostic significance of necrosis, LVI, the presence of sarcomatoid \nand/or rhabdoid differentiation, ISUP, and TNM 8th edition, these factors did \nnot influence the performance of our prognostic model. The model including the \nfive DNA methylation markers, age at diagnosis, sex, TNM stage (8th edition), \nISUP grading, and tumor size was the best performing model, thereby highlighting \nthe potential importance of molecular markers.\n\n© 2025 The Author(s).

However, current point-of-care testing platforms for methylation \nanalysis are constrained in achieving sufficient detection specificity due to \ntheir limitations in single-locus detection and their dependence on complex \ninstrumentation. In this study, to overcome the above limitations, a \nsmartphone-integrated, microfluidic chip technology-based biosensing platform \nwas engineered for simultaneous analysis of multiple methylation loci in ctDNA. \nIn this platform, whole blood samples from suspected individuals underwent GlaI \nmethylation-sensitive enzyme digestion and target-specific primer hybridization, \nfollowed by microfluidic chip loading for on-chip colorimetric reactions. \nMethylation levels at specific loci were quantified through chamber-specific \nabsorbance measurements by using the developed portable biosensing platform. The \nbiosensor achieved simultaneous detection of three specific methylation loci \n(CpG sites) on the Septin 9 gene, which are associated with colorectal cancer. \nThe detection limits (LODs) for the individual methylation loci are 0.25, 0.4, \nand 0.525 fM, respectively. This platform demonstrates high accuracy in \ndetecting methylation signatures within blood samples from colorectal cancer \npatients, showing a significant correlation with conventional diagnostic \nmethods. With its low cost and portable features, the developed biosensing \nplatform may provide an economical solution for early-stage screening of cancer \nfor the healthcare system in remote and under-resourced regions.\n\nDOI: 10.1021/acs.analchem.5c03822\nPMID: 40814833 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

However, the role of glycosylation in \ncolorectal cancer (CRC) remains incompletely understood. In this study, we \nidentified that CAFs exhibited the highest glycosylation levels in CRC. We \nclassified 6 CAFs subgroups with distinct glycosylation profiles, revealing \nnotable heterogeneity in functional activities, communication pathways, \ndevelopmental trajectories, and metabolic states. Furthermore, we developed and \nvalidated a robust prognostic model capable of predicting CRC patient survival \noutcomes using 101 machine learning algorithms. The model stratified patients \ninto high-risk and low-risk groups, where genetic and epigenetic alterations, \nimmune infiltration patterns and responses to various therapeutic drugs varied \nsignificantly between the groups. In vitro experiments demonstrated that the key \ngene CCDC85B in the model influences the glycosylation levels of CRC and CD8 + T \ncell infiltration, underscoring its potential as an essential therapeutic \ntarget. These findings underscore the functional complexity within CAFs \nsubgroups and highlight potential therapeutic targets for CRC treatment. These \nfindings deepen our understanding of glycosylation and offer tools for \nprognosis, drug selection, and targeted therapy in CRC patients.\n\n© 2025.

Through its ability to bind poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR), the histone \nvariant macroH2A1.1 facilitates TOP1cc repair factor recruitment and lesion \nturnover, thereby preventing DNA damage in response to transcription-associated \ntopological stress. The alternatively spliced macroH2A1.2 isoform is unable to \nbind PAR or protect from TOP1ccs. Impaired macroH2A1.1 splicing, a frequent \ncancer feature, was predictive of increased sensitivity to TOP1 poisons in a \npharmaco-genomic screen in breast cancer cells, and macroH2A1.1 inactivation \nmirrored this effect.

These chemicals are recognized for their persistency, the ability to \naccumulate in biological systems and their documented adverse effects on human \nhealth. Previous research, which has primarily centered on global methylation \npatterns, has suggested that some effects of PFAS on human health may be linked \nto modifications in DNA methylation (DNAm). The aim of our study was to assess \nthe relationship between the serum levels of PFOS and PFOA and CpG site-specific \nmethylation of DNA from peripheral blood.\nMETHODS: We used a case-control study on breast cancer nested within the E3N \ncohort, a prospective study of French women, in which we measured DNAm at more \nthan 850,000 CpG sites with the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip for \n166 case-control pairs. Serum levels of PFOS and PFOA were measured by liquid \nchromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry.\nRESULTS: We found 64 CpG sites with significant hypomethylation or \nhypermethylation associated with increased levels of PFOA or PFOS \n(p-valueBonferroni < 0.05). The strongest association was found between PFOA \nserum levels and decreased DNAm at cg06874740 (p-valueBonferroni = 2.2×10-5) and \nbetween PFOS serum levels and decreased DNAm at cg02793158 \n(p-valueBonferroni = 9.3×10-5). Gene-set enrichment analyses using all CpG sites \nassociated with PFOA or PFOS with an unadjusted p-value <0.01, identified 20 \nKEGG pathways for each of these compounds.\nCONCLUSION: PFAS exposure may be linked to substantial and widespread changes in \nthe methylome that may be involved in the consequences on health of these \npollutants. Our findings indicate that the biological and health effects of PFOA \nand PFOS may be more intricate and varied than previously thought, reinforcing \nthe need for policies aimed at regulating this class of endocrine-disrupting \nchemicals.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Omichessan, Dragic, Perduca, Truong, Polidoro, Kvaskoff, \nCano-Sancho, Antignac, Baglietto, Mancini and Severi.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fpubh.2025.1621495\nPMCID: PMC12336190\nPMID: 40791616 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.

The model \npredicted relapse risk in stage III CRC patients with an AUC of 0.90 and \nprognosis in stage IV patients. High-risk patients exhibited a significantly \nhigher early relapse rate (75.4% vs. 20%) and were more likely to have a low \nImmunoscore (IS), which correlates with poorer prognosis.\nDISCUSSION: ZNF671 and ZNF132 methylation levels inversely correlate with \nImmunoscore and may serve as valuable biomarkers for CRC immunotherapy.

However, the role of \nepigenetic regulation, particularly circular RNAs (circRNAs), in this process \nremains poorly understood. Using whole transcriptome and RNA sequencing, we \nidentified that circDCP2 was upregulated in CBNP-transformed cells and \nclinically lung cancer tissues. Moreover, circDCP2 was found to promote tumor \nprogression both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, N6-methyladenosine (m6A) \nmodification of circDCP2 promotes the transcriptional upregulation of cyclin D1 \n(CCND1) by interacting with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2/B1 \n(HnRNPA2B1), thereby activating the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway and promoting \nmalignant transformation. Additionally, circDCP2 facilitates the \nIGF2BP3-JAK-STAT signaling pathway, which promotes the reprogramming of \ntumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) into the M2-type TAMs via cytokines \nsecretion, contributing to the formation of an immunosuppressive \nmicroenvironment that further accelerates tumorigenesis and progression. Our \nresearch demonstrates that circDCP2 functions as an important regulator in \npromoting CBNP-induced lung carcinogenesis and may serve as a potential \ndiagnostic biomarker and a promising therapeutic target for lung cancer \npatients.\n\n© 2025.

However, the biological role of MCM6 has not been reported in \npan-cancer. In present study, a pan-cancer analysis of MCM6 was performed using \nmultiple databases and online websites. The relationship between MCM6 and DNA \nmethylation, prognosis, immune infiltration and immunotherapy response was \ninvestigated. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and least \nabsolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression models were \nperformed to construct prognostic risk signature for lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) \nbased on MCM6-related cell cycle genes (MrCCGs). Meanwhile, the biological \nfunction of MCM6 in lung adenocarcinoma was further verified through in vivo and \nin vitro experiments. MCM6 is highly expressed and is a prognostic risk factor \nin most tumors. MCM6 expression is significantly associated with the \ninfiltration of immune cells (especially MDSCs) in a variety of tumors. The risk \nsignature based on MrCCGs can reliably predict the prognosis of LUAD \n(AUC = 0.739). Immunohistochemical staining showed that the expression of MCM6 \nis higher in lung adenocarcinoma tissues compared with para-cancer tissues and \nis associated with the poor prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma patients. In vitro, \nMCM6 knockdown inhibited proliferation, invasion, and migration of A549 and \nH1299 cells, and blocked the G1 phase of the A549 cell cycle. In vivo, knockdown \nof MCM6 inhibited the growth of xenograft tumors in nude mice. The study \nsuggests that MCM6 may be a potential prognostic and immunological biomarker in \nmany cancers.\n\n© 2025.

This study \nevaluated machine learning models that merge methylated SEPTIN9 (SEPT9) and \nsecreted frizzled-related protein 2 (SFRP2) within circulating cell-free DNA \n(cfDNA) to detect HCC.\nMETHODS: A cohort of 165 healthy volunteers, 24 precancerous patients of HCC and \n112 HCC patients were divided into training and validation sets. Methylated \nSEPT9 and SFRP2 (mSEPT9/mSFRP2) were detected using real-time PCR. Based on \nthose methylation biomarkers and/or conventional biomarkers (CEA, AFP, CA125, \nand CA19-9), six machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest (RF), were \nemployed to establish models for the training set. Models were evaluated for \narea under the ROC curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity, and subsequently \nvalidated in the validation set.\nRESULTS: The RF model outperformed other models. In training, it achieved an AUC \nof 0.834 (95% CI: 0.745-0.923), exhibiting 69.3% sensitivity and 80.6% \nspecificity for the methylation-specific signature group (mSS group: \nmSEPT9/mSFRP2). In validation, the RF model for the mSS group showed an AUC of \n0.865 (95% CI: 0.811-0.946), with 85.4% sensitivity and 71.4% specificity.\nCONCLUSIONS: The RF-based model integrating mSEPT9/mSFRP2 in cfDNA can be a \npromising approach for HCC diagnosis.\n\nPlain Language Summary: Liver cancer is often found too late for effective \ntreatment. To help detect it earlier, we developed a simple blood test that \nlooks for chemical changes in two genes (SEPT9 and SFRP2) released by tumors. By \ncombining these gene signals with artificial intelligence (AI), our test \ncorrectly identified 85% of liver cancer cases while reducing false alarms. This \napproach offers a less invasive way to screen high-risk individuals, potentially \nsaving lives through earlier diagnosis.\n\nDOI: 10.1080/17520363.2025.2541574\nPMCID: PMC12416165\nPMID: 40757819 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors have no relevant affiliations or \nfinancial involvement with any organization or entity with a financial interest \nin or financial conflict with the subject matter or materials discussed in the \nmanuscript.

Predisposition to LS is caused by \ngermline mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes leading to elevated cancer \nprogression and microsatellite instability. FAP is associated with germline \nmutations in APC promoting cancer initiation and chromosomal instability. DNA \nmethylation is an important epigenetic mechanism in early tumorigenesis via, \ne.g., field defects in non-neoplastic colon. Our aim was to study genome-wide \nmethylation changes in colorectal specimens (adenomas and carcinomas \nsupplemented with paired normal colon) obtained during colonoscopy surveillance, \nand explore the role of such alterations in tumorigenesis, with a special focus \non early changes. To our best knowledge, this study is the first one to compare \naltered DNA methylation genome-wide in LS and FAP-associated colorectal \nneoplasia.\nRESULTS: DNA methylation alterations were subtle in FAP adenomas, whereas in LS \nadenomas, changes were abundant when compared to their normal counterparts. When \nFAP normal and LS normal colon were compared, DNA methylation changes of FAP \nnormal colon mirrored those occurring in LS tumors, suggesting that colorectal \ntumorigenesis-associated DNA methylation alterations take place already in FAP \nnormal colon mucosa. DNA methylation age was more variable in LS than FAP normal \ncolon, and in proximal than distal colon, when compared to individuals' age at \nthe time of sampling. In LS tumors, DNA methylation changes (hyper- and \nhypomethylation) were abundant even in adenomas with low-grade dysplasia and \nstable microsatellites and peaked in adenomas with high-grade dysplasia. LINE-1 \nhypomethylation was more prominent in LS adenomas than FAP adenomas, but normal \ncolon of LS and FAP displayed similar levels of LINE-1 methylation.\nCONCLUSIONS: Genome-wide DNA methylation changes are an integral part of FAP and \nLS-associated colorectal tumorigenesis. Occurrence at early stages, even in \nnon-neoplastic colonic mucosa, and increased prevalence with progressive \ndysplasia suggest a role in tumor development. Overlap of many of the topmost \nDNA methylation alterations between LS and FAP, and previous reports of their \noccurrence in sporadic colorectal and other tumors as well, imply their broad \nbiological relevance and possible biomarker potential for clinical applications.\n\n© 2025.

Current standard approaches for the detection of NPY \nhypermethylation levels rely on the use of enzymes and are associated with high \ncosts, long times of analysis and interferences from PCR inhibitors, which \nlimits their applicability in point-of-care or low-resource environments. \nTherefore, the need for an affordable, rapid, and sensitive technology for NPY \nmethylation detection is clear.\nRESULTS: Herein we present a novel, rapid, sensitive, highly selective, and \nenzyme-free photoelectrochemical ratiometric bio-platform for the detection and \nquantification of NPY gene hypermethylation. At the core of this method lies the \nuse of magnetic microbeads and singlet oxygen (1O2)-based photoelectrochemical \ndetection. The use of bisulfite conversion and hybridization temperature allowed \nto achieve a 99 % discrimination efficiency of the methylated NPY target from \nthe unmethylated one. Detection of 18 pM (18 fmol) of 94-nucleotide methylated \nNPY target sequence with 6 methylation sites in hybridization buffer and 45 pM \n(45 fmol) against the background of genomic DNA was achieved without any \namplification. Ultimately, ratiometric quantitative sensing of methylated NPY \ngene over reference albumin gene was carried out and an LOD of 2 % methylation \nlevel was obtained.\nSIGNIFICANCE: Overall, this technique demonstrated immense potential in \novercoming the complexity, high costs, and need for enzymes of current \nstrategies for hypermethylation detection and thus represents a great innovation \nin (photo)electrochemical sensing of aberrant DNA methylation. It, therefore, \nholds great promise for establishing in future a clinically relevant \npoint-of-care testing device.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

REs are typically silenced in somatic \ntissues via DNA methylation but can be reactivated through DNA hypomethylation, \npotentially impacting gene regulation. Here, we investigate genome-scale \nprofiles of RE methylation in high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) and \nassociations with survival among Black women.\nMETHODS: Methylation levels of LTR, LINE-1, and Alu (type of SINE) in 200 HGSOC \ntumors were predicted using a random forest approach and clustered using \nmultiple consensus algorithms. Associations between RE methylation clusters and \nsurvival were evaluated using Cox proportional hazard regression, adjusting for \nage, stage, and debulking status. We performed sensitivity analyses restricted \nto women with late-stage disease and with adjustment for BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations.\nRESULTS: Two RE methylation clusters were identified. Cluster 1 exhibited a more \nhypomethylated RE profile (\"Active\"), while Cluster 2 was more hypermethylated \n(\"Repressed\"). No statistically significant differences in patient or clinical \ncharacteristics were observed between clusters. Compared to the Active Cluster, \nthe Repressed Cluster was associated with an increased risk of mortality \n(HR = 2.41; 95% CI 1.04-5.59) and had a lower proportion of T cells. This \nassociation was consistent in sensitivity analyses.\nCONCLUSION: A more hypermethylated RE profile was linked to worse survival among \nBlack women with HGSOC, highlighting the potential of RE methylation as a \nprognostic biomarker. Further research is needed to understand the underlying \nbiological mechanisms and their implications in ovarian cancer biology and \ntreatment.\n\n© 2025.

However, the impact of \nchronic As3+ exposure on pluripotent stem cells, particularly through \nNrf2-mediated epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming, remains largely \nunexplored. In this study, we chronically exposed human induced pluripotent stem \ncells (iPSCs, Nips-B2) to an environmentally relevant concentration of trivalent \narsenic (0.25 μM, As3+) for three months. The tumorigenic potential of exposed \niPSCs was evaluated using anchorage-independent growth assays and xenograft \nmodels, while mechanistic insights were gained via chromatin immunoprecipitation \nsequencing (ChIP-seq) for Nrf2 and key histone modifications (H3K4me3, H3K9me3, \nH3K27me3, H3K36me3, and H4K20me3), alongside transcriptomic profiling by RNA \nsequencing (RNA-seq). Prolonged exposure markedly enhanced tumor sphere \nformation in vitro and accelerated tumor growth in vivo, indicating the \nacquisition of CSC-like traits. Integrated ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analyses \nrevealed widespread Nrf2 chromatin binding and global epigenetic remodeling, \ncharacterized by increased levels of H3K27me3, H3K36me3, and H4K20me3, a modest \nrise in H3K9me3, and reduced H3K4me3. Notably, As3+ exposure enhanced Nrf2 \nbinding at loci regulating glycolysis, cholesterol biosynthesis, self-renewal, \nand oncogenesis. Functional analyses confirmed that transcriptional and \nmetabolic changes were Nrf2-driven and closely linked to H3K36me3 and H3K27me3 \ndynamics. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that chronic As3+ exposure \nreprograms iPSCs through Nrf2 activation and coordinated epigenetic remodeling, \nrevealing a novel mechanism by which environmental carcinogens exploit stem cell \nplasticity to initiate CSC-like transformation.\n\nPublished by Elsevier B.V.\n\nDOI: 10.1016/j.redox.2025.103773\nPMCID: PMC12328897\nPMID: 40729963 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: Declaration of competing interest The authors \ndeclare no competing financial interests or personal relationships that could \nhave appeared to influence the work reported in this paper."

The addition of \ndurvalumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor, to the combination of \ncisplatin/gemcitabine has demonstrated an overall survival (OS) benefit and is \nnow a standard of care first-line treatment option. BTCs exhibit immunogenic \nfeatures may develop through an accumulation of genetic and epigenetic \nalterations, and can be influenced by microbial exposure. Microbiota can \ninfluence inflammation and immunity, and its disruption may impair tumor \nresponse to immunotherapy and chemotherapy. Here, the rationale and design of \nthe multi-center, single-arm ABC-12 trial (ISRCTN11210442) is described, which \ninvestigates the role of the microbiome in patients with advanced BTC in a \nfirst-line study of durvalumab (MEDI4736) in combination with \ncisplatin/gemcitabine. The primary objective is to determine the difference in \nbaseline alpha diversity between \"responders\" (partial or complete response) and \n\"non-responders\" at 18 weeks (RECIST 1.1) in patients treated with \ncisplatin/gemcitabine/durvalumab. Secondary objectives include investigating the \nassociation between microbiome parameters and objective response rate, tumor \ncontrol (partial, complete response, and stable disease), progression-free and \nOS, and investigating the interaction between treatment effect and microbiome \nparameters on clinical outcomes.\n\nPlain Language Summary: Biliary tract cancers (BTCs) are highly lethal cancers. \nUntil recently, cisplatin plus gemcitabine was the standard chemotherapy regimen \nfor patients with BTC where surgery was not possible. Durvalumab is an \nimmunotherapy which works by assisting the immune system to recognize and attack \ncancer cells. The addition of durvalumab to cisplatin and gemcitabine has shown \na survival benefit.Thousands of bacteria live in the human digestive system, \nwhich are called the microbiota. Each person has an individual community of \nmicroorganisms, and the microbiome is a collection of genomes (genetic material) \nfrom all the microorganisms in the environment, and this varies greatly from one \nperson to the other. This is responsible for the breakdown of food, changing \nfood into energy for the body, and protecting against infections. It also helps \nin developing the immune system. Research shows that its disruption can cause \ndisease, including cancer, and can affect response to chemotherapy and \nimmunotherapy. The aim of this trial is to assess whether the number and types \nof bacteria that live naturally in saliva and the bowel impact the response to \nthe combination of immunotherapy with cisplatin and gemcitabine in patients with \nbiliary tract cancer, where cure is not possible.\n\nDOI: 10.1080/14796694.2025.2539018\nPMCID: PMC12407636\nPMID: 40728861 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: YTM has received consultancy fees from \nAstraZeneca, Taiho and Astellas and personal fees from Faron, Incyte and Roche. \nRG has received speaker honoraria from AstraZeneca and has served on advisory \nboards for Astellas.

Therefore, AHRR DNAm could identify a more \"fragile\" group at risk for \ncancer mortality than questionnaire-based evaluations. Given this, the aim was \nto identify \"fragile\" groups at risk of cancer mortality by integrating \nquestionnaire-based smoking indices and leukocyte AHRR DNAm levels in the \nJapanese population.\nMETHODS: The target population was 795 participants without a clinical history \nwho underwent a health checkup in 1990. They were followed for up to 30 years \nfor mortality. The AHRR DNAm levels in leukocytes were measured by the \npyrosequencing method. HRs for cancer mortality were calculated using a Cox \nproportional hazards model.\nRESULTS: Significantly higher HRs for all-cancer mortality were observed in low \nAHRR DNAm groups regardless of smoking intensity [pack-years <20: 3.69 \n(1.46-9.37); pack-years ≥20: 2.13 (1.11-4.09)]. Compared with current smokers, \nsignificantly lower HRs for all-cancer mortality were observed in the group with \nhigh AHRR DNAm regardless of years since quitting [YSQ ≤10: 0.13 (0.02-0.96); \nYSQ >10: 0.28 (0.08-0.98)]. Even for YSQ greater than 10, there was no \nsignificant mortality risk reduction in the low AHRR DNAm group.\nCONCLUSIONS: The population with low AHRR DNAm levels had a higher risk of \ncancer mortality even with low smoking exposure. Furthermore, no significant \nrisk reduction was observed in former smokers with low AHRR DNAm levels.\nIMPACT: AHRR DNAm levels in leukocytes may help identify groups at risk for \ncancer mortality overlooked by questionnaire-based smoking indices.\n\n©2025 American Association for Cancer Research.\n\nDOI: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-25-0625\nPMID: 40728511 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

To investigate the characterization of \nDNA methylation (DNAm) episignatures for radon-induced lung cancer, we detected \nthe specific changes in DNAm in blood and lung tissues using reduced \nrepresentation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS). We identified the differentially \nmethylated regions (DMRs) induced by radon exposure. The bioinformatics analysis \nof the DMR-mapped genes revealed that pathways in cancer were affected by radon \nexposure. Among them, the DNAm episignatures of MAPK10, PLCG1, PLCβ3 and PIK3R2 \nwere repeated between lung tissue and blood, and validated by the MassArray. In \naddition, radon exposure promoted lung cancer development in the genetic \nengineering mouse model (GEMM), accompanied by decreased MAPK10 and increased \nPLCG1, PLCβ3, and PIK3R2 with mRNA and protein levels. Conclusively, radon \nexposure significantly changes the genomic DNAm patterns in lung tissue and \nblood. The DNAm episignatures of MAPK10, PLCG1, PLCβ3 and PIK3R2 have a \nsignificant influence on radon-induced lung cancer. This brings a new \nperspective to understanding the pathways involved in radon-induced lung cancer \nand offers potential targets for developing blood-based biomarkers and \nepigenetic therapeutics.\n\nDOI: 10.3390/ijms26146873\nPMCID: PMC12295219\nPMID: 40725119 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare no conflicts of interest."

SNP rs615552_AL359922.1 \nexhibited significant colocalization with key genes CDKN2A, CDKN2B, and \nCDKN2B-AS1, implicating its role in the regulation of gene expression. The long \nnon-coding RNA CDKN2B-AS1 demonstrated both co-occurrence and co-expression with \nCDKN2A and CDKN2B, suggesting a coordinated regulatory mechanism among these \ngenes. TERT emerged as a gene with shared susceptibility across brain cancer and \nother diseases, indicating a common genetic pathway. Methylation sites \nassociated with mQTL, such as cg03935379 (TERT) and cg14069088 (CDKN2A), were \nidentified as independent prognostic factors for lower-grade glioma (LGG), but \nnot for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Bulk RNA-seq, spatial, and single-cell \ntranscriptomic analyses revealed that CDKN2B-AS1 is predominantly expressed in \nmalignant and dendritic cells (DCs), and is associated with DNA repair pathways \nin malignant cells and antigen presentation genes in DCs. This study offers a \ncomprehensive perspective on the genetic and molecular factors influencing brain \ncancer. The results highlight the intricate nature of gene regulation in cancer \nand suggest the potential of CDKN2B-AS1 as a key regulator of immune responses \nand tumor suppressor genes. The SNP rs615552_AL359922.1 represents a significant \npathogenic SNP for brain cancer. The identification of shared genetic \nmechanisms, particularly involving TERT, with other diseases points to new \nopportunities for developing therapeutic targets and diagnostic tools. Future \nresearch should focus on functional validation and the investigation of \nenvironmental interactions to fully leverage these findings for advancing brain \ncancer management.\n\n© 2025.

The anatomical, \nhistological, morphological, and genetic differences between the right and left \ncolons contribute to disparities in tumor incidence, clinical presentation, \nprognosis, and therapeutic responses, depending on the tumor's localization. We \naimed to investigate the expression patterns of the CMTM3 and SSTR2 genes both \nof which are hypermethylated and potentially involved in the development and \nprogression of colorectal tumors in tumors originating from the right and left \ncolon. The study consisted of 89 histopathologically diagnosed tumour tissue \nsamples, 42 from the right colon and 47 from the left colon, and 89 healthy \ntissue samples from the same individuals adjacent to the tumour tissue. The \nexpression of the CMTM3 and SSTR2 genes was analysed using the comparative CT \n(ΔΔCT) method in real-time PCR. Our findings demonstrated a significant \nupregulation of CMTM3 and SSTR2 expression in tumor tissues compared to adjacent \nnormal tissues (p < 0.05). Notably, CMTM3 expression was significantly higher in \nleft-sided colon tumors (2-ΔΔCT = 20.95) compared to those originating from the \nright colon (2-ΔΔCT = 14.13) (p = 0.027). This study is the first to suggest \nthat elevated CMTM3 expression may be associated with the increased incidence \nand distinct molecular behavior of left-sided colorectal tumors.

This study \nevaluates the diagnostic accuracy of the commercially available DNA methylation \npanel, GynTect® (ASTN1, DLX1, ITGA4, RXFP3, SOX17, and ZNF671), in cervical \ncytology samples from 146 women for detecting cervical intraepithelial neoplasia \ngrade 3 (CIN3) or cervical carcinoma (CC). This analysis focuses particularly on \nthe performance of the ZNF671 methylation marker (ZNF671m) within the panel.\nRESULTS: The positive rates of all triage markers-hrHPV, TCT, HPV16/18, \nGynTect®, and ZNF671m-correlated with increasing severity of CIN lesions \n(Chi-squared test for trend, P < 0.01). ZNF671m exhibited the highest Area Under \nthe Curve (AUC) of 0.811 (95% CI: 0.734-0.888) for identifying CIN3 + cases, \nclosely followed by GynTect® (AUC 0.800, 95% CI: 0.721-0.878). Among 102 \nhrHPV-positive women, employing GynTect® or ZNF671m instead of TCT yielded \nidentical sensitivity (0.84; 95% CI: 0.69-1.01) but enhanced specificity (86% \nand 90%, respectively) for detecting CIN3 +. Adding HPV16/18 to the triage \nstrategy maintained similar outcomes. Additionally, ZNF671m showed a significant \nrisk difference (60.0%; 95% CI 42.8-77.1%) for detecting CIN3 +, on par with \nGynTect® (57.6%; 95% CI 37.9-71.2%).\nCONCLUSION: ZNF671m within the GynTect® panel demonstrates robust triage \nperformance in diagnosing CIN3 + cases, with efficacy comparable to the full \npanel. These findings suggest that ZNF671m could be a promising alternative for \ncytologic triage, warranting further validation.\n\n© 2025.

Epigenomic features, such \nas post-translational modification of histones and chromatin accessibility, are \nkey determinants of transcription factor binding and thereby play an important \nrole in controlling transcriptional responses to the tissue environment. It \nremains unknown whether systemic tumor-associated signals could alter the \nepigenomic landscape of peripheral monocytes before they reach the tumor, thus \nshaping their subsequent response to the tumor microenvironment.\nMETHODS: We used a combination of genome-wide assays for chromatin accessibility \nand multiple histone modifications (H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K27ac) in a mouse tumor \nmodel to investigate changes in the epigenomic landscape of peripheral \nmonocytes. We then integrated these epigenomic data with transcriptomic data to \nlink altered regulatory elements to gene expression changes in monocytes \noccurring in the periphery or during tumor infiltration.\nRESULTS: We found that tumor-induced systemic inflammation was associated with \ntranscriptional and epigenomic preconditioning of peripheral monocytes. The \ndistal tumor caused extensive remodeling of both H3K4me3+ promoters and H3K4me1+ \nenhancers. Specifically, this involved the repression of interferon-responsive \nregulatory elements as well as the establishment of enhancers harboring binding \nmotifs for transcription factor families downstream of pro-inflammatory \nsignaling, such as C/EBP, AP-1, and STAT. Reprogrammed enhancers in peripheral \nmonocytes were linked to sustained gene expression changes that persisted after \ntumor infiltration. In addition, key pro-tumor genes upregulated in \ntumor-infiltrating monocytes showed epigenetic priming already in the \ncirculation.\nCONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that cancer-associated remodeling of the \nepigenomic landscape in peripheral monocytes can shape the gene expression \nprograms they acquire in the tumor, highlighting the role of the epigenome in \nredirecting monocyte function to support cancer progression.\n\n© 2025.

In forensic genetics, \nDNA methylation can be used to estimate the age of a stain donor. As lifestyle \nand disease can alter a person's methylation profile, the accuracy of forensic \nage estimation tools might decrease compared to the chronological age when \nestimating a person affected by cancer. In our study, we applied the VISAGE \nenhanced age estimation tool on blood samples from cancer patients suffering \nfrom a variety of cancer entities, including solid and hematologic tumours. A \ncomparison of the age estimation errors between the cancer patients (n = 100) \nand a healthy control cohort (n = 102) revealed small statistically significant \ndifferences and a tendency towards age acceleration in the blood of these \npatients. Although this study showed that in patients with aggressive cancers \n(like CLL or AML) estimation accuracy is clearly decreased, for most entities \nthe observed differences were subtle and an analysis of individual CpG sites did \nnot reveal strikingly different methylation patterns. Conclusively, age \nestimation on blood stains from cancer patients might not result in \nsignificantly higher estimation errors, except for very aggressive forms of \ncancer.\n\nDOI: 10.18632/aging.206281\nPMCID: PMC12339023\nPMID: 40689873 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: CONFLICTS OF INTEREST: The authors declare no \nconflicts of interest."

However, the number of cytotoxic agents is limited, and \nthe treatment effect is not satisfactory. Therefore, new agent and combination \nstrategies are to be explored.\nMETHODS: The antitumor efficacy of low-dose epigenetic modifiers (LD-EMs) of \n5-azacytidine and entinostat, cytotoxic agents of paclitaxel, cisplatin, \noxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and a novel cytotoxic agent TIC10, and the \ncombination of LD-EMs and cytotoxic agents was investigated in vivo. Flow \ncytometry and immunohistochemistry were conducted to analyze the immune \nphenotype in the tumor microenvironment. The proliferation and apoptosis \nanalyses were performed in vitro.\nRESULTS: LD-EM therapy demonstrated superior tumor inhibition compared with \ncommonly used chemotherapy in gastrointestinal cancer. A novel cytotoxic agent \nTIC10 resulted in weak to moderate tumor growth inhibition (TGI). LD-EMs \nexhibited a more pronounced antitumor effect than TIC10 alone (CT26: TGI of \n74.5% vs. 46.2%, respectively; p < 0.05; HNM007: TGI of 52.0% vs. 21.4%, \nrespectively; p < 0.05; AKR: TGI of 53.8% vs. 10.1%, respectively; p < 0.05). \nThe combination of TIC10 and LD-EMs led to a more pronounced tumor reduction \nwith tolerable toxicity. Analysis of the immune profiles showed increased \npercentages of CD45+ lymphocytes, CD3+ and CD8+ T cells, M1 macrophages, and \ndendritic cells, whereas decreased percentages of M2 macrophages and \nmyeloid-derived suppressor cells under treatment with LD-EMs and combination \ntherapy. Mechanistic studies revealed that LD-EMs activated the RIG-I-MAVS \npathway, stimulated type I interferon responses, and subsequently promoted \nchemokine secretion. In contrast, TIC10 suppressed cell viability and induced \ncell apoptosis.\nCONCLUSIONS: LD-EMs remodeled the tumor microenvironment to an immune-promoting \nenvironment.

The \npresence of hepatic steatosis was determined by an ultrasound examination and \nSteatoTest. HLA genotyping for 11 genes, including HLA class I and class II, was \nconducted using next-generation sequencing.\nRESULTS: Four HLA class II alleles, HLA-DQA1*01:02:02 (p = 0.019), \nHLA-DQB1*05:02:01 (p = 0.014), HLA-DRB1*16:01:01 (p = 0.032), and \nHLA-DRB5*02:02:01 (p = 0.052), were found to be positively associated with high \nlevels of HBV-DNA. Furthermore, when studying the association of HLA class I and \nclass II alleles with hepatic steatosis, our data showed that HLA-B*08:01:01 (p \n= 0.011), HLA-C*07:01:01 (p = 0.011), and HLA-DRB3*01:01:02 (p = 0.027) were \npositively correlated with the presence of hepatic steatosis.\nCONCLUSIONS: Integrating next-generation sequencing data of HLA genes in genomic \nand epigenomic data can offer a comprehensive understanding of the molecular \nmechanisms underlying HBV infection. This integrated approach will help identify \nnew biomarkers, deeply understand the complex interactions between genetic and \nepigenetic factors, and facilitate the development of personalized prevention \nand treatment strategies.\n\nDOI: 10.7754/Clin.Lab.2025.250119\nPMID: 40663089 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

However, the comparative predictive value of AAs derived \nfrom different epigenetic clocks for mortality risk has not been systematically \nevaluated. In this retrospective cohort study based on 1,942 NHANES participants \n(median age 65 years; 944 women), we examined the associations between AAs from \nmultiple epigenetic clocks and the risks of all-cause, cancer-specific, and \ncardiac mortality. Restricted cubic spline models were used to assess the shape \nof these associations, and Cox proportional hazards regression was employed to \nquantify risk estimates. Model performance was compared using the Akaike \nInformation Criterion (AIC) and concordance index (C-index). Our findings \nrevealed that only GrimAge AA and GrimAge2 AA demonstrated approximately linear \nand positive associations with all three mortality outcomes. Both were \nsignificantly associated with increased risks of death, and these associations \nwere consistent across most subgroups. GrimAge and GrimAge2 AAs showed very \nsimilar performance in predicting all-cause, cancer and cardiac mortality, with \nonly small differences in AIC values and C-index scores. These findings suggest \nthat both GrimAge and GrimAge2 are effective epigenetic biomarkers for mortality \nrisk prediction and may be valuable tools in future ageing-related research.\n\nDOI: 10.1080/15592294.2025.2530618\nPMCID: PMC12269703\nPMID: 40658048 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: No potential conflict of interest was reported \nby the author(s)."

Herein, we \ndemonstrate that UPF3B accelerates the proliferation ability of liver cancer \ncells in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, UPF3B affects epigenetic regulation in \nhuman liver cancer cells. Moreover, ATAC-seq results show that chromatin \naccessibility is changed between rLV group and rLV-UPF3B group. Therefore, UPF3B \nalters transcriptome and proteome in liver cancer. In particular, UPF3B affects \nthe heterogeneity of liver cancer and its microenvironment network. Furthermore, \nUPF3B promotes the modification ability of H3K4me3, H4K16Ac, and RNAPolII on \npromoter region of CDK12 and then increased the expression of CDK12. Strikingly, \nUPF3B enhances the interaction between LC3 and DOR, ATG4 and LC3, ATG3 and LC3, \nATG3 and ATG12, ATG3 and ATG16L1, ATG3 and ATG7, ATG3 and ATG9A, and the \nexpression of activated LC3, beclin1 dependent on CDK12.

Importantly, our results indicate that CDK12 determines the oncogenic \nfunction of UPF3B.

Among the most frequently \naltered genes are PTEN, AR-V7, TP53, TMPRSS2-ERG, and ERBB2, each with potential \nrelevance for stratifying risk and guiding targeted therapy. Methods: This \nretrospective study included 43 patients with advanced prostate cancer who \nunderwent radical prostatectomy. Tumor specimens were analyzed using \nfluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to assess the mutational status of the \nfive markers. Clinicopathological parameters, including PSA levels, Gleason \nscore, tumor stage, and invasion status, were correlated with molecular \nalterations using multinomial logistic regression. Results: The most common \nisolated alteration was PTEN loss (20.9%), followed by TP53 amplification \n(16.3%), TMPRSS2-ERG fusion (13.9%), AR-V7 expression (11.6%), and ERBB2 \namplification (7%). Combined alterations were also observed, with dual or triple \nmarker expression in select aggressive cases. PTEN- and AR-V7+ were associated \nwith low PSA values despite aggressive pathology, while ERBB2+ correlated with \nhigh PSA levels and high Gleason scores. TP53+ and ERBB2+ were also \nsignificantly associated with high-grade tumors (Gleason 7). AR-V7+ was the only \nmarker significantly associated with seminal vesicle invasion. Younger age was \nweakly correlated with AR-V7+ and TP53+ status. Conclusions: The molecular \nprofile defined by PTEN, AR-V7, TP53, and ERBB2 identifies distinct biological \nsubtypes in advanced prostate cancer, each with specific prognostic and \ntherapeutic implications. Integration of these biomarkers into routine clinical \nassessment may improve treatment personalization and risk stratification. \nValidation in larger, prospective cohorts is warranted.\n\nCelsius.\n\nDOI: 10.21614/chirurgia.3151\nPMID: 40637064 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

DNAm in tumor tissues exclusively \nexhibits cancerization with expansion of a stem cell pool, leading to the lowest \nDNAm age; this raises a question about its cancer predictability. Thus, the DNAm \naging marker in pre-diagnostic peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) may provide \nkey information on CRC etiology and prevention. We aim to examine pre-diagnostic \nepigenetic makers for aging in PBLs in association with CRC development and risk \nmodification by lifestyles.\nMETHODS: Using data from a large cohort study of white postmenopausal women, we \nexamined biological aging status in PBLs via three well-established epigenetic \nclocks-Horvath's, Hannum's and Levine's-and prospectively evaluated CRC \ndevelopment in relation to the aging markers and risk modification by lifestyle \nfactors.\nRESULTS: The epigenetic clocks strongly correlated with chronological age, and \nolder DNAm age and age acceleration were significantly associated with increased \nrisk for CRC. Women with bilateral oophorectomy before natural menopause had \nsubstantially higher risk for CRC development when they also had epigenetically \naccelerated aging phenotypes. Among women who maintained healthy dietary \npatterns, no apparently higher risk was found in those with accelerated aging \ncompared with those with decelerated aging.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings contribute to better understanding of the role of a \npre-diagnostic epigenetic aging biomarker and its interplay with lifestyles in \nCRC carcinogenesis, informing risk stratification strategies for aged \nindividuals.\n\nDOI: 10.18632/aging.206276\nPMCID: PMC12339025\nPMID: 40632935 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: CONFLICTS OF INTEREST: The authors declare no \nconflicts of interest related to this study."

Both 5-methylcytosine (m5C) methylation and \nlong noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play crucial roles in the epigenetics of RCC and \nmay serve as biomarkers for predicting prognosis. Clinical information and \ntranscriptome data of patients with RCC were extracted from the The Cancer \nGenome Atlas database. Using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator \nanalysis and multivariate Cox regression, m5C-related lncRNAs were filtered. We \nthen built a prognostic prediction model based on m5C-related lncRNAs. The model \nwas analyzed for its predictive role in overall survival (OS) and response to \ntargeted and immunotherapeutic treatments. We selected 3 lncRNAs, HM13-IT1, \nCOLCA1, and AC010285.3, to construct a predictive model that categorizes \npatients into high-risk and low-risk groups. The results indicated that the \nhigh-risk group exhibited a significantly poorer OS than the low-risk group, and \nupon validation, it was identified as an independent risk factor. Through gene \nontology enrichment analysis, this model was found to be closely associated with \ntumor immune function. The high-risk group showed higher tumor mutation burden \nand tumor immune dysfunction and exclusion scores, suggesting poorer response to \nimmunotherapy. Additionally, the high-risk group exhibited reduced \nresponsiveness to sorafenib. The predictive model for RCC can accurately \nforecast the prognosis of RCC, offering new tools for personalized diagnosis and \ntreatment of individual patients.\n\nCopyright © 2025 the Author(s).

Age acceleration residuals \n(AgeAcc) were computed and tested for associations with nine diseases using \nnon-parametric statistics.\nFINDINGS: PathwayAge achieved high predictive accuracy (Rho = 0.977, MAE = \n2.350) in cross-validation and across 15 independent blood-based validation \ncohorts (Rho = 0.677-0.979, MAE = 2.113-6.837), including a Chinese population \n(Rho = 0.972, MAE = 2.302). Compared to established clocks, PathwayAge showed \nimproved performance in both age estimation and disease association analyses. \nSignificant AgeAcc differences were observed across nine diseases, with \ndisease-specific pathways confirmed by permutation tests (P < 0.02). Top \npathways implicated in ageing included autophagy, cell adhesion, synaptic \nsignalling, and metabolic regulation. GO-based clustering revealed consistent \nageing signatures across disease categories, including neuropsychiatric, immune, \nmetabolic, and cancer-related conditions. Cross-omics validation using \ntranscriptomic data further supported the model's biological relevance (Rho = \n0.70, MAE = 7.21).\nINTERPRETATION: PathwayAge represents an interpretable, biologically grounded \nframework for estimating epigenetic age. By integrating pathway-level \nmethylation signals, it uncovers mechanistic links between ageing and disease, \nwith potential applications in biomarker development and precision ageing \nmedicine.\nFUNDING: This research was supported by the Greater Bay Area Institute of \nPrecision Medicine (Grant No. I0007), the National Social Science Foundation of \nChina (Grant No. 32370639), and was further supported by the Shanghai Key \nLaboratory of Psychotic Disorders Open Grant (Grant No: 21-K01).

In this study, leveraging the multi-omics data of Genome-wide \nassociation studies (GWAS), methylation quantitative trait locus (mQTL) and \nexpression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) collected from The Cancer Genome \nAtlas (TCGA), Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project and Gene Expression \nOmnibus (GEO) database, a joint analysis of cox proportional hazard regression \nand Summary-data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) analysis were adapted to \ninvestigate the causal associations of DNAm, gene expression and the GC \nprognosis. The results showed the causal association of hypermethylation of \ncg16007185, down-regulation of TMX1, and poorer prognosis of GC patients. \nMendelian randomization (MR) analysis revealed that exposure to PCB-99, a type \nof polychlorinated biphenyl, might lead to the hypermethylation of cg16007185. \nMediation analysis showed the borderline mediation role of TMX1 in the \nassociation between cg16007185 and GC survival, with an indirect effect (IE) of \n5.24% (P = 0.102).

Here, we show that exposure to environmentally relevant \nconcentrations of As³⁺ disrupts chromatin architectures in human bronchial \nepithelial cells (BEAS-2B) by discordantly regulating two key repressive histone \nmodifications: histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) and H3K9me3. \nChromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIP-seq) reveals a genome-wide \ngain of H3K27me3 and a marked loss of H3K9me3 following As³⁺ treatment. \nMechanistically, As3+ downregulates PALI1, an essential accessory subunit of the \npolycomb repressive complex 2.1 (PRC2.1), which uniquely coordinates H3K27me3 \nand H3K9me3 deposition via EZH2 and G9a, respectively. Loss of PALI1 impairs \nthis dual repression mechanism, leading to widespread chromatin deregulation. \nGene ontological analysis reveals that regions with diminished H3K9me3 in \nAs³⁺-treated cells are enriched in pathways related to PRC2 activity, ribosomal \nbiogenesis, stemness-associated transcription factors, xenobiotic metabolism \n(phases I and II), and GPCR signaling. Notably, these regions also include \nLINE-1 retrotransposons, whose de-repression is known to drive genomic \ninstability-a hallmark of cancer. Given PALI1's potential tumor-suppressive role \nin lung, breast, and colon cancers, and other malignancies, its suppression by \nAs³⁺ likely contributes to carcinogenesis through epigenetic reprogramming, \ngenome destabilization, and activation of oncogenic transcriptional programs. \nThese findings reveal a novel mechanism of As³⁺-induced epigenetic dysregulation \nand highlight the central role of histone modifications in environmental \ncarcinogenesis.\n\n© The author(s).\n\nDOI: 10.7150/ijbs.115605\nPMCID: PMC12223765\nPMID: 40612682 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: Competing Interests: The authors have declared \nthat no competing interest exists."

However, the reliability of DNA methylation-based smoking \nsignatures in predicting smoking status and their prognostic value in CRC remain \nunclear, particularly across different biological sample types.\nRESULTS: Five previously validated methylation-based smoking signatures were \nanalyzed in 2237 CRC patients with blood-derived DNA and 2273 patients with \ntumor tissue-derived DNA. Blood-derived signatures showed strong correlations \nwith self-reported smoking status, effectively differentiating current smokers \nfrom never smokers (all p < 0.0001), with excellent discriminative ability \n(median area under the receiver operating characteristic curve: 0.94). In \ncontrast, tumor tissue-derived signatures exhibited much weaker associations \nwith smoking status. Among non-metastatic CRC patients, blood-derived \nmethylation signatures were significantly associated with increased risks of \nall-cause and non-CRC-related mortality, but not with CRC-specific mortality. \nConversely, two tumor tissue-derived signatures demonstrated stronger \nassociations with CRC-specific mortality compared to blood-derived signatures.\nCONCLUSIONS: Blood-derived methylation-based smoking signatures are robust \nindicators for smoking exposure and are associated with increased mortality risk \namong non-metastatic CRC patients. When applied to tumor tissue, signatures \nshowed stronger associations with CRC-specific mortality.\n\n© 2025.

However, the role of methylation patterns in EOC \nheterogeneity and prognosis remains unclear. In this study, genome-wide \nassociation studies (GWAS) data from the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium \n(OCAC) and Methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTL) data from the Genetics of \nDNA Methylation Consortium (GoDMC) were analysed using two-sample Mendelian \nrandomization (MR). We investigated the genetic effects of CpG methylation on \nthe risk and prognosis of five major EOC histotypes. To further explore the \nmechanisms by which DNA methylation affects EOC outcomes, we performed mediation \nanalysis to evaluate the role of immunophenotypes. Our analysis identified 94 \nCpG sites associated with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), 9 of which \nwere linked to prognosis. Additional significant associations were found for \nclear cell, low-grade serous, endometrioid, and mucinous subtypes. \nHypomethylation at specific CpG sites was linked to increased EOC risk and \nshorter survival. Mediation analysis revealed significant interactions between \nCpG methylation and immunophenotypes, suggesting that immune modulation mediates \nthe effects of DNA methylation on EOC outcomes. These results provide novel \ninsights into the importance of epigenetic and immune-related factors in EOC \npathogenesis.\n\nDOI: 10.1080/15592294.2025.2527145\nPMCID: PMC12233829\nPMID: 40610364 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: No potential conflict of interest was reported \nby the author(s)."

However, the molecular \nmechanisms that underlie its pathogenic effects are only partially understood. \nTo address the research gap, this study utilizes a comprehensive bioinformatic \napproach to identify key microRNAs (miRNAs) that target high-risk genes \nassociated with H. pylori at an epigenetic level. The miRNAs in question, \nincluding hsa-mir-539, hsa-mir-361, hsa-mir-203a, hsa-mir-7-1, hsa-let-7f-1, \nhsa-mir-133a-1, and hsa-mir-186, were validated through rigorous database \nsearches and cross-referencing. By curating the miRNet and other miRNA \nplatforms, the study uncovered intricate regulatory networks between these \nmiRNAs and transcription factors (TFs) such as androgen receptor (AR), BCL6, and \nGATA1. These interactions play a crucial role in inflammatory and carcinogenic \npathways. The functional annotation of the miRNAs highlights their significant \nroles in essential biological processes and pathways that are relevant to H. \npylori infection and gastric cancer progression. Overall, this integrated \nanalysis provides critical insights into the molecular landscape of H. \npylori-induced ulceration and carcinogenesis. This information may offer \npotential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for future research and clinical \napplications in managing gut health.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Elsevier Ltd.

(S.L.), a traditional Chinese medicine \nfrom the Rosaceae family, is recognized for its rich content of triterpenoids, \nwhich are known for their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-tumor \nproperties. Although its traditional uses and biological activities are well \nknown, its role in preventing colon cancer and the underlying mechanisms remain \nunclear. This study aims to elucidate the preventive mechanisms of triterpenoids \nin both raw (TR) and processed (TP) forms of S.L. against colon cancer.\nMETHODS: The AOM/DSS-induced mouse model of colon cancer was employed to \nelucidate the mechanism underlying the preventive effects of Sanguisorba \nofficinalis L. triterpenoids (ST) against colon cancer. A comprehensive suite of \ntechniques, including hematoxylin-eosin staining (H&E), immunohistochemistry \n(IHC), TUNEL staining, Western blotting (WB), and DNA methylation analysis, was \nutilized to investigate the preventive effects of ST on colon cancer. The main \nactive compounds were identified using UPLC-Q-TOF-MS, and potential active \ncompounds were screened through network pharmacology and molecular docking. The \nstability of the protein-ligand complexes was further assessed using molecular \ndynamics simulations.\nRESULTS: In vivo experiments, treatment with ST significantly improved the \nclinical manifestations, Disease Activity Index (DAI) scores, and pathological \nlesions associated with colon cancer, with all drug administration groups \noutperforming the model group. Additionally, ST markedly enhanced gut barrier \nfunction by downregulating the levels of TNF-α, p65, COX-2, and iNOS. \nFurthermore, ST dramatically ameliorated the colonic immune-inflammatory state, \nwhich was associated with decreased expression of proliferative proteins and \nincreased expression of apoptotic proteins. Among the identified triterpenoids, \ncompound 27 May be the main active compound. Notably, compound 27 can form a \nstable complex with TNF-α.\nCONCLUSION: These results suggest that TP has a more pronounced colon cancer \nprevention effect than TR. TP play a role in preventing colon cancer by \ndown-regulating TNF-α and thereby inhibiting the NF-κB signaling pathway. This \nresearch not only fills the mechanism gap of S.L. in the field of colon cancer \nprevention, but also provides methodological support and theoretical foundation \nfor its transition from traditional Chinese medicine to clinical practice \nthrough the integration of multi-disciplinary technologies and the verification \nof precise targets.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Gan, Mu, Ali, Shi, Jiang, Wang, Wu, Wang, Wang, Zhang, Feng and \nYang.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2025.1605326\nPMCID: PMC12213563\nPMID: 40607420 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest."

As these modifications are reversible, targeting \nthem may offer preventive and therapeutic benefits. Origanum onites L. essential \noil (OOEO) has demonstrated anticancer properties in various cancers, but its \nepigenetic effects in GC remain unexplored.\nMETHODS: OOEO was extracted by water distillation, and its effects on gastric \nadenocarcinoma (AGS) and normal gastric epithelial (GES-1) cells were evaluated. \nCytotoxicity was assessed via WST-8 assay, apoptosis by Annexin V staining, DNA \ndamage by γ-H2AX test, and epigenetic modifications by methylation-specific PCR \nand histone modification analysis.\nRESULTS: Compared to GES-1 cells, OOEO exhibited cytotoxic activity even at \nlower concentrations in AGS cells. OOEO treatment induced apoptosis and DNA \ndouble-strand breaks and arrested cell cycle at S and G2/M phases compared to \nthe untreated group. OOEO also caused a decrease in promoter methylation of LOX, \nTIMP3, CDH1 and RARB genes and was found to globally alter 16 histone \nmodifications in AGS cells and 19 histone modifications in GES-1 cells. OOEO \ncontributed to the reorganization of H3K9ac modification in the promoters of \nCDKN1A, MYC, RUNX3, RASSF1 and CDH1 genes and H3K27me3 modification in the \npromoters of CDKN1A and MYC genes.\nCONCLUSION: OOEO exhibits epigenetic regulatory properties that may contribute \nto GC prevention and treatment. Its potential in neoadjuvant or combinatory \ntherapies warrants further investigation.\n\n© 2025.

The cooperation of epigenetic \nmodifications and metabolic adaptations enables tumor cells to dynamically \nadjust for survival in variable environments, which is crucial for tumor \nmetastasis and worth exploring in depth.\nMETHODS: RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing, transmission electron microscopy \nphotograph and GFP-mCherry-LC3 fluorescence imaging were employed to reveal the \nrole of insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 3 (IGF2BP3) in \ntriple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. Then, in the presence of rapamycin, \nfurther experiments showed that IGF2BP3's role in TNBC metastasis was \nautophagy-mediated. Methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing, luciferase \nassays and co-immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry showed that IGF2BP3 promoted \nmRNA translation initiation in an N6-methyladenosine (m6A)-dependent manner.\nRESULTS: We found that IGF2BP3 could link epigenetic modification and metabolic \nadaptation to promote autophagy-mediated TNBC metastasis. As an m6A binding \nprotein that is specifically highly expressed in TNBC, IGF2BP3 could bind to the \nm6A motif of c-Met mRNA, regulating autophagy-mediated epithelial-to-mesenchymal \ntransition via the c-Met/PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Moreover, IGF2BP3 recruited \neIF4G2 as a collaborator, promoting c-Met protein expression by facilitating \nm6A-dependent and cap-independent mRNA translation initiation, rather than \naffecting mRNA stability.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study expands the understanding of IGF2BP3's role in TNBC \nmetastasis by establishing its function in regulating autophagy. Notably, \nIGF2BP3 could bind to the m6A motif on the 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) \nof c-Met mRNA to facilitate its translation in a cap-independent manner.\n\n© 2025.

AC-selective \ndrugs have an advantage in side effect control, and the specific AC may finally \nbe considered as a therapeutic target. We show that adenylyl cyclase 4 (ADCY4), \nwhich is silenced by DNA methylation and is critical for breast cancer (BC) \npatient survival, plays essential roles in anti-tumor effects in BC cells. DNA \nmethyltransferase inhibitor and histone deacetylase inhibitor can restore ADCY4 \nmRNA expression in ADCY4-silenced BC cells. ADCY4 directly affects BC cell \nproliferation, apoptosis, invasion, and metastasis. Mechanistically, ADCY4 \nconverts ATP to cAMP and activates cAMP/PKA signaling, leading to a decrease in \nthe phosphorylation level of downstream FAK/AKT and ERK signaling and creating a \nsuppression environment for cell survival. Ectopic ADCY4 inhibits BC growth, \nwhich is blocked by cAMP inhibition, activating AKT and ERK. The present study \nprovides evidence that human BC relies upon this epigenetic silenced \nADCY4-associated ATP-cAMP loop for phosphorylation and activation of FAK/AKT and \nERK signaling. Also, ADCY4 increases BC cell chemosensitivity to paclitaxel. The \nobservations demonstrates that ADCY4 is a significant tumor suppressor and that \nloss of ADCY4 functions by DNA methylation hampers cAMP signaling and triggers \nFAK/AKT and ERK signaling during breast tumorigenesis.\n\n© 2025.

Modeling such effects at the epigenetic level, here we examine \nwhether cellular DNA methylation (DNAm) markers of chronic stress - derived from \nhuman fibroblasts undergoing prolonged exposure to physiological stress cortisol \nlevels - distinguish BC phenotypes in two independent human cohorts. Our results \nshow that methylomic signatures of stress are consistently higher in tumor \nsamples as compared to normal samples and in more advanced tumor stages and \ngrades.

To examine the \nrole of oxidative stress, a putative PDAC risk factor, we established an \norganoid-based transformation system. Although the prototypic oxidant H2O2 \ninduced organoid transformation, its effect was nonmutational and was mediated \nby the oxidant-responsive transcription factor NRF2, which induced the histone \nmethyltransferase EZH2. Congruently, nonoxidizing NRF2 activators triggered \norganoid malignant conversion through NRF2 and EZH2, establishing a hitherto \nunknown epigenetic mechanism underlying PanIN-to-PDAC progression. While NRF2 \ninduced EZH2 gene transcription in mouse and human PDAC, EZH2, a general \nrepressor, coactivated transcription of NRF2-encoding NFE2L2 and interacted with \nother transcription factors to induce genes that sustain PDAC metabolic demands. \nThe self-amplifying NRF2-EZH2 epigenetic loop also accounted for \ninflammation-driven PanIN-to-PDAC progression in vivo and was upregulated in \nestablished human PDAC, whose malignancy was maintained by NRF2 binding to the \nEZH2 promoter.\n\n© 2025.

Our previous work identified the embryonic stem \ncell-specific gene DNMT3B, a de novo DNA methyltransferase, as aberrantly \nactivated in breast cancer, correlating with aggressive tumour behaviour and \nhigh relapse risk, regardless of molecular subtype. Through integrative \nbioinformatic analyses of DNA methylation and transcriptomic data, we identified \n154 genes downregulated via DNMT3B-driven promoter hypermethylation, many of \nwhich are associated with high relapse risk. Notably, the tumour suppressor gene \nGATA3 emerged as a primary target of functional inactivation through either \nloss-of-function mutations or DNMT3B-controlled hypermethylation, in a mutually \nexclusive manner. Both mechanisms of GATA3 inactivation were associated with \nsimilar molecular signatures linked to tumour progression, increased malignancy, \nand poorer prognosis. However, distinct differences were observed, with immune- \nand inflammation-related genes enriched in GATA3 hypermethylation cases but \ndepleted in mutation-driven silencing. Additionally, our analysis uncovered \nother potential tumour suppressor genes epigenetically repressed in aggressive \nbreast cancers. These findings underscore a broader role of GATA3 inactivation \nbeyond genetic alterations and suggest therapeutic opportunities to target \nepigenetically silenced tumour suppressors in aggressive breast tumours.\n\n© The Author(s) 2025.

How different \nepigenetic alterations like m1A, m5C, and m6A contribute to tumor development is \na field that still needs to be investigated. The immune modulators, CD70, CD80, \nand TIGIT, mainly regulate T-cell activation and consequently the immune evasion \nof tumors. Here, we explored the presence and the potential consequences of RNA \nmodifications in these regulators in pan-cancer. Our findings highlight the \ncritical role of the m6A, m5C, and m1A in regulating CD70, CD80, and TIGIT \nacross multiple solid tumors. By combining epitranscriptomics data with \nfunctional enrichment and survival modeling, we show that RNA modification \nenzymes not only modulate immune-related gene expression but also serve as \npotential biomarkers for patient prognosis. By constructing a robust four-gene \nprognostic signature involving YTHDF3, RBM15B, IGF2BP2, and TRMT61A, we \ndemonstrate that RNA modification profiles can accurately stratify patients into \nrisk groups with distinct overall survival outcomes. The performance of this \nmodel across eight cancer types underscores the translational promise of \nepitranscriptomic markers in both mechanistic understanding and personalized \noncology. Altogether, our study bridges the gap between the mechanistic \nregulation of immune checkpoints and their clinical utility, offering novel \ninsights into how the epitranscriptome can be leveraged to improve cancer \nprognosis and potentially enhance immunotherapeutic strategies.\n\nDOI: 10.3390/ijms26125772\nPMCID: PMC12193086\nPMID: 40565233 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare no conflicts of interest."

THOR methylation in rPA was closer to carcinoma than to normal tissue, \nsimilar in rPA and tissues adjacent to rPA, and higher in tissues adjacent to \ncarcinomas than in non-neoplastic tissues. A subset of PA-adjacent tissues \nshowed epigenetic alterations, suggesting an increased risk of recurrence or \nmalignant transformation (5-15%).

These cystic tumors are defined by their \nmucinous epithelium and ovarian-like stroma, with an estimated 10% risk of \nprogression to invasive carcinoma. The origin of the ovarian-like stroma remains \na subject of debate. In this study, we conducted immunohistochemical profiling, \ntargeted DNA sequencing, and genome-wide DNA methylation analysis on a cohort of \n15 pancreatic MCNs (MCN-P) and six hepatic MCNs (MCN-L). Using \nimmunohistochemistry and targeted DNA sequencing, we unequivocally established \nthe diagnosis of MCN. Unsupervised DNA methylation profile analysis of reference \nclasses of pancreatic neoplasms (11 entities and normal pancreatic tissue from \n224 unique samples) revealed that MCN-P predominantly forms a distinct group. In \nthe DNA methylation landscape of liver tumors, encompassing five tumor types and \nnormal bile duct tissue from 136 unique samples, MCN-L demonstrated a specific \nmethylation profile when compared with all other entities. Furthermore, within \nthe DNA methylation landscape of ovarian tumors - featuring five tumor types, \nnormal Fallopian tube, and normal ovarian tissue from 90 unique samples - we \nfound that both MCN-P and MCN-L grouped with mucinous ovarian carcinoma and \nmucinous borderline ovarian tumors (mBOTs). Notably, low-grade MCNs exhibited \ngreater DNA methylation similarities to mBOTs, while high-grade or invasive MCNs \nwere primarily associated with mucinous ovarian carcinomas. When analyzing all \nsamples together (19 tumor types and four normal tissue types, n = 430), MCNs \nsimilarly grouped with mucinous ovarian tumors and normal ovarian tissue. \nAdditionally, in a network analysis of differentially methylated probes, MCN-P \nand MCN-L share significant methylation traits, closely resembling mucinous \novarian tumors. In conclusion, our findings highlight that MCN-P and MCN-L are \ndistinct entities in the landscape of pancreatic and hepatic tumors and show DNA \nmethylation profile similarities with mucinous ovarian tumors, suggesting a \npotential common origin. © 2025 The Author(s).

Diagnostic methods often fail to assess precancerous \nlesion risk, delaying oral cancer diagnosis. New molecular biomarkers, \nparticularly DNA methylation, are sought to better stratify patients' risk. The \nPreCursor-M+ (Fujirebio, Tokyo, Japan), which analyze hypermethylation of the \ntwo onco-suppressor FAM19A4 and miR124-2 in cervical samples from high-risk \nHPV-positive women, was used to assess the methylation level of 111 oral samples \ndistinguished in oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC), oral potentially \nmalignant disorders (OPMD) benign lesions (BL), and no lesions (NL). HPV was \ndetected by INNO-LiPA HPV Genotyping Extra II (Fujirebio, Tokyo, Japan). \nHypermethylation was correlated with the severity of the diagnosis. A positive \nresult was more common in OSCC (p < 0.0001). HPV positivity correlated with \nhypermethylation in OSCCs (32.4%, p = 0.0006), although statistical significance \nwas also found in HPV-negatives (p = 0.0007). HPV16-positive OSCC showed higher \nmethylation. Targets' methylation increased from the NL to the BL, OPMD and \nOSCCs groups. The methylation status of FAM19A4 and miR-124-2 may play an \nimportant role in the progression of oral cancer and, consequently, in \ndetermining the prognosis of patients with OPMD, for whom hypermethylation would \nsuggest the need for close monitoring. Furthermore, HPV16's association with \nhypermethylation suggests its involvement in oral carcinogenesis. To confirm \nthese results and gain further insight into HPV's role in methylation \nimpairment, the sample size will be increased.\n\n© 2025 The Author(s).

Compared to \npatients with other malignancies, people with acute leukemia (AL) have a higher \nincidence of congestive heart failure. It is yet unknown how recently discovered \nAL and CAD are related. Recent research highlights P53's critical role as a \n\"gatekeeper\" of cardiac function, facilitating the repair of double-strand DNA \nbreaks. Mutations in TP53 lead to impaired DNA repair, increased cardiomyocyte \napoptosis following ischemia, and ultimately contribute to cardiac dysfunction. \nThe current study aims to investigate epigenetic regulators' role in CD4+ T \nhelper cells (TH) extracted from Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) of \nCoronary Artery Disease (CAD) and Acute Leukemia (AL) patients, potentially \nelucidating their connection. Our experimental data revealed that reduced P53 \ngene expression correlated with increased Histone (H3) trimethylation on Lysine \nresidue 27 (K27), DNA methylation, and R-loop frequencies, alongside decreased \nHistone (H3) trimethylation on Lysine residue 4 (K4) and m6A methylation, \ncontributing to diminished TH1-ness in CAD and AL patients. Through P53 \ndepletion and overexpression in CD4+TH cells of Normal subjects, CAD, and AL \npatients, we observed that P53 overexpression reversed these epigenetic and \nepitranscriptomic modifications. Specifically, in immunologically challenged \nCD4+TH cells of CAD and AL patients, P53 overexpression led to decreased K27 \ntrimethylation, DNA methylation, and R-loop frequencies, coupled with increased \nK4 trimethylation and m6A methylation, subsequently upregulating mRNA levels of \nTH1-associated genes, promoting protective immunity. Therefore, a thorough \nunderstanding of the intricate relationship between CAD and AL may improve \nprevention, prompt detection, and appropriate treatment of those diseases.\n\n© 2025.

This multidisciplinary study systematically \ninvestigates PET's carcinogenic mechanisms by integrating network toxicology, \nmachine learning, molecular docking simulations, single-cell RNA sequencing, and \nspatial transcriptomics. We identified PET-associated oncogenic targets and \nconducted pan-cancer expression profiling with prognostic analyses of 22 core \ngenes, subsequently employing machine learning algorithms to quantify their \nprognostic weights across malignancies. Molecular docking revealed six \nhigh-affinity PET-binding targets (PIK3CA, TOP2A, PARP1, SRC, EP300, CREBBP; \nbinding energies <-6.0 kcal/mol) predominantly expressed in T-cells and \nphagocytic cells, with significant infiltration into malignant tumor regions. \nMechanistically, PET exposure may drive carcinogenesis through three synergistic \npathways: dysregulation of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling axis via PIK3CA, \ncompromised DNA repair mechanisms through TOP2A/PARP1 interactions, and \nepigenetic reprogramming mediated by the EP300/CREBBP transcriptional complex. \nThese molecular perturbations collectively induce genomic instability, immune \ndysregulation, and tumor evolution by disrupting cellular homeostasis, DNA \nintegrity maintenance, and chromatin remodeling processes. Finally, we confirmed \nthat PET exposure promotes tumor cell proliferation by experiments such as clone \nformation and western blotting, that the effect increases with exposure \nconcentration, and that PET exposure increases TOP2A protein levels. Our \nfindings not only delineate PET's role in tumorigenesis but also establish a \ncomputational-experimental framework for environmental toxicant evaluation.

Epigenetic clocks, derived from sets of DNA methylation CpGs \nand mathematical algorithms, have demonstrated a remarkable ability to indicate \nbiological aging and age-related health risks. \nDunedin(P)ace(o)f(A)ging(m)ethylation is a single-timepoint DNA methylation \nclock. It is an aging speedometer rather than a state measure. The association \nbetween the DunedinPoAm-measured pace of biological aging and cancer risk based \non a nationally non-institutionalized sample remains to be elucidated. Physical \nactivity, a modifiable lifestyle factor, is associated with delayed biological \naging and lower risks of developing cancer. We hypothesized that \nDunedinPoAm-measured pace of biological aging is positively associated with \ncancer risk, and physical activity moderates this association.\nRESULTS: In total, 2,529 participants aged 50 or older from the National Health \nand Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2002 were included. Weighted \nlogistic regression calculating odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals \n(CI) showed that when scaled per 1-SD increase, DunedinPoAm was positively \nassociated with cancer risk (OR, 95% CI) (1.21, 1.05-1.39) in the crude model \nand adjusted for age and sex (1.19, 1.01-1.40). Individuals of high DunedinPoAm \ntertile had a 68% (95% CI 1.16-2.43) increase in cancer risk compared with the \nlow tertile (P trend < 0.001). As hypothesized, effect modification by physical \nactivity was significant (P interaction = 0.013). The association was apparent \nin physically inactive participants (1.52, 1.16-2.00), whereas insignificant in \nphysically active individuals (1.08, 0.89-1.32). Exploratory interaction \nanalyses for other covariates showed significant effect modification by age \n(> 65 years, 1.38, 1.08-1.77 vs 50-65 years, 1.00, 0.79-1.27).\nCONCLUSION: The study supported the hypothesis by demonstrating a positive \nassociation between the DunedinPoAm-measured pace of biological aging and cancer \nrisk and a modulating role of physical activity. Physically inactive individuals \nor participants over 65 years showed increased susceptibility to this \nassociation. These findings suggest that incorporating the DunedinPoAm-measured \npace of biological aging into cancer screening strategies may benefit those with \nphysically inactive lifestyles and older individuals. Whether physical activity \ncan mitigate the increased risk of cancer in individuals with a faster pace of \nbiological aging needs to be validated in further interventional cohort studies.\n\n© 2025.

Currently, there are no efficient \nstrategies for tracking and eradicating CSCs. Here we propose a nanovaccine \nstrategy, called NICER, based on a nanovesicle system integrating CSC-specific \nantigen display and epigenetic nano-regulator encapsulation with a \ndendritic-cell-targeting aptamer, to simultaneously eradicate CSCs and bulk \ntumour cells. Specifically, nanovesicles derived from \naldehyde-dehydrogenase-overexpressing tumours could serve as integrated antigens \ncarrying both CSC-specific antigen and tumour-associated antigen. Epigenetic \nnano-regulator targeting YTH N6-methyladenosine RNA binding protein 1 could \nrestrict dendritic cell lysosomal protease activity to modulate the effective \ncross-presentation of integrated antigens via major histocompatibility complex \nclass I for immune responses. Overall, NICER represents a broad-spectrum vaccine \napproach against both CSCs and bulk tumours that can significantly inhibit \npostoperative cancer recurrence and metastasis, prolonging survival rates.\n\n© 2025.

There was no \nstatistically significant association between methylation, expression, and \ninflammation status for other genes between patients and controls.\nCONCLUSION: In ulcerative colitis, inflammation is thought to be associated with \nboth increased APC2 methylation and decreased expression findings due to \ndecreased SFRP4 methylation in non-inflamed areas.

However, \nthe genotoxic and mutagenic effects of Cr(VI) in humans at low-to-moderate \noccupational exposure levels are unknown. This study aims to investigate the \nrelationship between occupational exposure to Cr(VI) and the presence of \noxidative damage, genetic and epigenetic alterations.\nMETHODS: We included 113 Cr(VI) exposed workers in 14 companies and 72 controls \nrecruited within the SafeChrom project. Cr(VI) was measured in inhalable dust \nand total chromium in urine (U-Cr) and red blood cells (RBC-Cr). Analysed effect \nbiomarkers included urinary 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), micronuclei in \nperipheral blood reticulocytes (MNRET), blood relative mitochondrial DNA copy \nnumber (mtDNA-cn), relative telomere length (TL), and blood DNA methylation of \nfour lung cancer-related genes (F2RL3, LINE-1, MGMT promoter and SEMA4B).\nRESULTS: The median inhalable Cr(VI) concentration among the exposed workers was \n0.11 μg/m3 (5th-95th percentile: 0.02-8.44). Exposed workers showed higher \n8-OHdG, TL, and MGMT promoter methylation levels and lower mtDNA-cn and MNRET \ncompared with controls. Company-based differences in biomarkers were observed. \nUnivariate analysis showed that TL was positively correlated with U-Cr, and \n8-OHdG and MGMT promoter methylation were positively correlated with RBC-Cr. \nMultivariate analyses with adjustment for possible confounders showed higher \n8-OHdG, TL, and MGMT promoter methylation in exposed workers compared with \ncontrols.\nCONCLUSIONS: Low-to-moderate Cr(VI) exposure was associated with higher \noxidative stress, longer telomeres and epigenetic alterations, changes that \npreviously have been linked to lung cancer risk. This study highlights the \nmolecular impacts of Cr(VI) exposure, underscoring the importance of reducing \nthe exposure to Cr(VI).\n\nCopyright © 2025 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Two Spindlin-1 inhibitors (A366, \nMS31) were characterized to differentiate between drug and target-specific \neffects. We performed a comprehensive study regarding the influence of \nSpindlin-1 inhibition on various immune cells. A366 and MS31 showed immune cell \ntype-dependent cytotoxicity with IC50 values in the ranges of 37-143 µM and \n11-3122 µM, respectively, macrophages tending to be less susceptible than \nlymphocytes. A366 had only minor effects on M1 polarization, whereas MS31 \nshifted the M1 to a M2 phenotype, as shown by regulated cytokines and surface \nmarker expression. Both A366 and MS31 weakened the polarization of \npredifferentiated M2 macrophages by reducing surface marker expression, \ncytokines, and inflammatory markers. A366 and MS31 had no effect on activation \nand energy metabolism of CD4+ T cells. Interestingly, 5 µM A366 and 2.5 µM MS31 \nclearly prevented B cell activation, as shown by reduced proliferation, \nplasmablast formation, and release of immunoglobulins A and G. Additionally, \nA366 increased energy metabolism in B cells. In conclusion, the inhibition of \nSpindlin-1 had only minor effects on polarization of macrophages and T cell \nproliferation but profoundly prevented B cell activation at low concentrations. \nThis suggests that Spindlin-1 inhibitors, while mediating anticancerogenic \neffects, may also suppress the humoral immune response and increase infection \nrisk.\n\n© The Author(s) 2025.

We investigated whether methylation quantitative trait loci \n(mQTLs) are associated with CRC risk, survival and recurrence.\nMETHODS: Using a well-characterised Scottish case-control study (6821 CRC cases, \n14,692 controls), we derived 118,982 mQTLs based on the Genetics of DNA \nMethylation Consortium (GoDMC). Association analysis between mQTLs and CRC risk, \nsurvival and recurrence was performed using logistic regression or Cox models \nrespectively. Additionally, colocalisation analysis was performed.\nRESULTS: 19 mQTLs within 10 distinct genomic regions were associated with CRC \nrisk. Two novel regions were mapped to MDGA2 (p value =  3.0 ×  10-6 ) and \nSTARD3 (p value =  5.6 ×  10-6 ). Four regions mapped to POU5F1B, \nPOU2AF2 (c11orf53)/POU2AF3 (COLCA2), GREM1 and CABLES2 were previously \nidentified. Four regions mapped to PPA2, PANDAR/LAP3P2, POU6F1 and CTIF \ncontained SNPs previously identified by CRC GWAS but with SNPs annotated to \ndifferent genes. We found no evidence that any of the 19 mQTLs associated with \nCRC risk influenced survival or recurrence after FDR correction. Colocalisation \nanalysis suggested that in three of the ten regions the causal variants were \nshared for methylation and CRC risk.\nCONCLUSION: This study adds to the repertoire of CRC genes. However, we found no \nassociations between methylation and CRC survival or recurrence.\n\n© 2025.

In multivariable linear regression models, full adherence to \nhealthy behaviors reduced GrimAge2AA by β = -5.55 years, PhenoAgeAA by β = -2.64 \nyears, and DunedinPoAm by β = -0.06 SD, with smoking cessation demonstrating the \nstrongest GrimAge2AA attenuation (10.17 years). Stratified analyses revealed \npronounced benefits: cancer patients adhering to healthy diets (β = -0.04 SD, P \nfor interaction = 0.01) and hypertensive individuals reducing smoking (β = -0.05 \nSD, P for interaction = 0.04) showed significant EAA mitigation. The sensitivity \nanalysis is consistent with the original results. Mediation analyses indicated \nGrimAge2AA accounted for 63.58% of lifestyle-survival associations, DunedinPoAm \n(44.63%) and PhenoAgeAA (28.45%).\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that comprehensive adherence to healthy \nlifestyle behaviors is associated with reduced epigenetic aging, supporting \ntheir potential utility as targets for mortality risk mitigation.

In this study, we dissected the \ndrivers of resistance by perturbing organoids derived from patients with \ncolorectal cancer longitudinally with drugs in sequence. Combined longitudinal \nlineage tracking, single-cell multiomics analysis, evolutionary modeling, and \nmachine learning revealed that different targeted drugs select for distinct \nsubclones, supporting rationally designed drug sequences. The cellular memory of \ndrug resistance was encoded as a heritable epigenetic configuration from which \nmultiple transcriptional programs could run, supporting a one-to-many \n(epi)genotype-to-phenotype map that explains how clonal expansions and \nplasticity manifest together. This epigenetic landscape may ensure \ndrug-resistant subclones can exhibit distinct phenotypes in changing \nenvironments while still preserving the cellular memory encoding for their \nselective advantage. Chemotherapy resistance was instead entirely driven by \ntransient phenotypic plasticity rather than stable clonal selection. Inducing \nfurther chromosomal instability before drug application changed clonal evolution \nbut not convergent transcriptional programs. Collectively, these data show how \ngenetic and epigenetic alterations are selected to engender a \"permissive \nepigenome\" that enables phenotypic plasticity.\nSIGNIFICANCE: Drug resistance is driven by genetic-epigenetic memory that \nenables cancer cells to adopt multiple phenotypic states depending on \nenvironmental conditions, supporting integration of evolutionary principles into \nbiomarker discovery and personalized treatment strategies.

While global CC incidence and mortality have declined, these regions \ncontinue to face high rates due to inadequate screening and the high prevalence \nof HIV, which increases CC risk by promoting persistent HPV infections. This \nstudy aimed to identify DNA methylation (DNAm) biomarkers for cervical \nintraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and CC in HIV-positive Nigerian women and to \nassess their potential for clinical risk prediction. From 2018 to 2020, 538 \nparticipants were recruited from Nigerian tertiary hospitals. Cervical tissue \nsamples were analyzed for DNAm using the Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip \narray, and HPV genotyping was conducted via next-generation sequencing. An \nepigenome-wide association study revealed 24 significant DNAm biomarkers \nassociated with CIN and CC. These biomarkers showed hypermethylation in tumor \nsuppressor genes (e.g., PRMD8), hypomethylation in oncogenes (e.g., MIR520H), \nand aberrant methylation in genes related to HIV/HPV infection and oncogenesis \n(e.g., GNB5, LMO4, FOXK2, NMT1). A machine learning-based DNAm classifier \nachieved 92.9% sensitivity and 88.6% specificity in predicting CC risk, with \nhigher risk observed in adjacent normal cervical samples from CIN/CC patients \nand HIV/HPV co-infected women. DNAm biomarkers offer a promising approach to \nenhancing CC screening and early detection, particularly for HIV-positive women \nin LMICs. The DNAm-based model developed in this study shows potential for more \naccurate CC risk stratification, highlighting the need for further optimization, \nvalidation, and implementation in low-resource settings.\n\n© 2025 UICC.\n\nDOI: 10.1002/ijc.35502\nPMID: 40490892 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

The role of microsomal triglyceride \ntransfer protein (MTTP) in CAG progression has not been explored, presenting a \ncritical knowledge gap in understanding H. pylori-induced CAG pathogenesis.\nMETHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats and gastric epithelial cell line were infected with \nH. pylori to build CAG model. The mRNA and protein levels of DNA \nmethyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), MTTP, and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) were \nmeasured by quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) and western blotting, \nrespectively. Moreover, the localization of DNMT1 and MTTP was detected via \nimmunohistochemistry. Furthermore, the pathological changes of gastric tissue \nwere analyzed by HE staining.\nRESULTS: The MTTP expression was downregulated in CAG. Moreover, overexpression \nof MTTP in gastric epithelial cells could suppress the inflammatory response \ninduced by H. pylori infection and ferroptosis by upregulating GPX4 expression. \nIn addition, DNMT1 expression was upregulated in CAG and was negatively \ncorrelated with MTTP expression. Furthermore, DNMT1 could target MTTP promoter \nto activate methylation and downregulate MTTP expression.\nCONCLUSION: DNMT1 downregulated the MTTP expression through methylation, and \nthus mediate inflammasome-ferroptosis processes via GPX4 in the H. \npylori-induced CAG.\n\nPlain Language Summary: Chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG) is a condition where \nthe stomach lining becomes thinner and more damaged over time. It is often \ncaused by infection with common stomach bacteria called Helicobacter pylori (H. \npylori). CAG increases the risk of developing stomach cancer, so understanding \nhow it develops is important for finding better treatments.In this study, we \nlooked at a protein called MTTP, which usually helps with fat transport in \ncells. We found that MTTP levels are much lower in the stomachs of people and \nanimals with CAG. When we increased MTTP levels in stomach cells in the lab, the \ncells were less damaged by H. pylori. This means MTTP may help protect stomach \ncells.We also discovered that another protein, DNMT1, plays a role in reducing \nMTTP levels.

Tumor-agnostic \napproaches that rely on mutation-based assessment in fixed panels of common \ncancer driver genes have shown limited utility for detecting MRD in EBC. \nMethylation-based MRD (mMRD) may overcome the limitations of genomic-based MRD \n(gMRD), though limited clinical validation is available.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: To investigate this, we analyzed 290 longitudinally \nbanked plasma samples from 95 participants diagnosed with early-stage estrogen \nreceptor (ER)-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative \n(ER-positive) and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) undergoing neoadjuvant \nchemotherapy using a high-sensitivity genomic and epigenomic-based, \ntumor-agnostic ctDNA platform.\nRESULTS: The baseline (pre-chemotherapy) ctDNA detection (mMRD) rate was 72.5% \n(66/91) across all participants (ER-positive: 33/48, 69%; TNBC: 33/43, 77%). \nBaseline ctDNA detection (mMRD) was associated with a higher risk of recurrence \n[hazard ratio (HR) 9.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3-70.3, P = 0.03]. \nDetection of ctDNA (mMRD) in the post-operative and follow-up periods were \nprognostic of worse event-free survival (EFS) (HR 17.0, 95% CI 6.0-48.0, P < \n0.0001) with 62.5% sensitivity and 100% specificity for recurrence (positive \npredictive value 100%). The median lead time from mMRD detection to clinical \nrecurrence was 152 days (range 15-748 days). gMRD, derived from plasma-only \npanel-based next-generation sequencing, was evaluated in all matched time \npoints; the prognostic value was limited by clonal hematopoiesis of \nindeterminate potential, including pathogenic mutations in common cancer driver \ngenes. Despite refinements in gMRD analysis, it remained inferior to mMRD. A \ncombination of mMRD and gMRD did not outperform mMRD alone.\nCONCLUSION: These results support further development of tumor-agnostic mMRD \nassays for the detection of ctDNA and assessment of these assays to develop \nclinical utility in this setting.\n\nCopyright © 2025 The Author(s).

There is a critical need for \nmore dependable biomarkers to identify high-risk individuals in the \nperioperative phase. This is essential for enhancing postoperative interventions \nand positively influencing clinical results.\nMETHOD: We collected a tissue DNA methylation cohort of 73 stage I-III \nsurgically treated patients as the discovery set for model development. The \nmodel was established using recurrence-free survival (RFS) as the primary \nendpoint. Subsequently, its prognostic value was validated in an independent \ncohort of 30 stage I-III surgical patients, and further confirmed across \ndifferent patient subgroups.\nRESULTS: We developed an Early to Mid-term NSCLC Recurrence LASSO score (EMRL) \npredictive model based on five differentially methylated regions (DMRs). The \nEMRL model was significantly associated with RFS in stage I-III surgically \ntreated patients (RFS: log-rank P = 0.00032) and was confirmed as an independent \nprognostic factor in multivariate Cox regression analysis (HR = 0.35, 95% \nconfidence interval 0.20-0.61, P < 0.001). Notably, EMRL not only identified \nhigh-risk patients within the same TNM stage but also demonstrated strong \npredictive performance in patient subgroups harboring EGFR-TKI-sensitive \nmutations and those with positive PD-L1 expression.\nCONCLUSION: In this study, we developed a postoperative recurrence prediction \nmodel based on preoperative tissue methylation characteristics to identify \nindividuals in I-III stage NSCLC patients following surgical resection who may \nhave a higher risk of recurrence. This offers opportunities for early \npersonalized treatment and follow-up strategy.\n\n© 2025.

Diets rich in charred and fried red meats, thus high in heterocyclic \naromatic amines [e.g., 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP)], \nare associated with increased colon cancer risk. Conversely, the consumption of \nfruits and vegetables offers protective effects, potentially modulating multiple \ncarcinogenesis-related pathways. Here, we investigated the metabolomic response \nto apiaceous and cruciferous vegetable consumption in relation to concomitant \nPhIP consumption. In a randomized crossover design, 25 participants underwent \nfour phases with four different test meals at the end of each phase. Test meals \nwere well-done hamburger (Control), Control plus cruciferous vegetables (Cru), \nControl plus apiaceous vegetables (Api), and Control plus combined vegetable \ntypes (Cru + Api). Urine samples were subjected to metabolomics analysis using \nUPLC-MS/MS system. A total of 660 metabolites were identified. The Cru and Api \nmeals showed distinct metabolite profiles, and the Cru + Api meal induced 133 \nmetabolite changes compared to Control. Meals with cruciferous vegetables \nenriched S-methylcysteine, S-methylcysteine sulfoxide, N-acetylproline, \nsulforaphane-related compounds, and xenobiotic and amino acid metabolites the \nmost. The Api meal was not as effective in altering xenobiotic metabolites. Api \nprimarily elevated mannitol/sorbitol. To a lesser extent, both \nvegetable-supplemented meals induced changes in nucleotide-derived metabolites \nsuggesting potential epigenetic modifications. The findings reinforce the \ninfluence of these vegetables on xenobiotic metabolism pathways, highlight \npotential epigenetic mechanisms and potential biomarkers of food intake, and \nprovide further elucidation of their possible roles in colon cancer prevention.\n\nCopyright © 2024.

Nevertheless, there \nremains controversial in clinical practice about the use of EGFR-TKI adjuvant \ntherapy for patients with stage IB EGFRm NSCLC.\nMETHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted at the Second Xiangya \nHospital of Central South University. From January 2011 to December 2020, \ncompletely resected stage IA-IB NSCLC (8th TNM staging) patients with sensitive \nEGFR mutation were included. FFPE tumor and lymph node specimens were collected \nand subjected to the 8-gene methylation panel using modified MOB-qMSP approach. \nWe employed stepwise regression to select variables and logistic regression to \nestablish the predictive model. Cross-validation and decision curve analysis \nwere performed.\nRESULTS: A total of 242 patients with IA2-IB EGFRm NSCLC were included in the \nstudy. Among these patients, 86 constituted the recurrence (Rec) group, while \n156 formed the non-recurrence (Non-Rec) group. Through stepwise logistic \nregression, seven crucial feature variables were identified, including five-gene \nmethylation variables (CDO1, TAC1, p16, CDH13, and APC) and two clinical \nvariables (tumor invasion and differentiation). The ROC analysis revealed an AUC \nof 0.873 for the model with these seven variables. Internal cross-validation \ndemonstrated a model accuracy exceeding 77%. The nomogram and decision curve \nanalysis underscored the clinical utility of the model. We calculated the total \nscore for each patient based on the nomogram and divided the patients into \nhigh-risk and low-risk groups. The cumulative risk curves for both groups \nevidenced that the recurrence risk in the high-risk group was significantly \nhigher than in the low-risk group. We further divided the dataset into two \ncohorts-stage IA2-IA3 patients and stage IB patients. The model maintained a \nhigh AUC value (0.879) in stage IA2-A3 patients.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that the methylation of five genes-CDO1, \nTAC1, p16, CDH13, and APC-in N2 lymph nodes represents a strong biomarker panel \nfor predicting recurrence in stage IB EGFRm NSCLC after curative resection. This \napproach also shows exceptional predictive accuracy for postoperative recurrence \nin stage IA2-IA3 EGFRm NSCLC.\n\n© 2025.

Lineage plasticity is a \ncontinuum, ranging from AR activity-low tumors, AR-null tumors that do not \nexpress a neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) program (i.e., double-negative \nprostate cancer [DNPC]), and AR-null NEPC tumors. Factors upregulated early in \nlineage plasticity are not well-characterized. The clarification of such factors \nis essential to identify tumors undergoing lineage plasticity or at risk of this \noccurring. Our integrative analysis of metastatic prostate cancer patient \ntumors, patient-derived xenografts, and cell models determined that PROX1 is \nupregulated early in the lineage plasticity continuum and progressively \nincreases as tumors lose AR activity. We determined DNA methylation is a key \nregulator of PROX1 expression. PROX1 suppression in DNPC and NEPC reduces cell \nsurvival and impacts apoptosis and differentiation, demonstrating PROX1's \nfunctional importance. PROX1 is not directly targetable with standard drug \ndevelopment approaches. However, affinity immunopurification demonstrated \nhistone deacetylases (HDACs) are among the top PROX1-interacting proteins; HDAC \ninhibition depletes PROX1 and recapitulates PROX1 suppression in DNPC and NEPC. \nAltogether, our results suggest PROX1 promotes the emergence of lineage \nplasticity, and HDAC inhibition is a promising approach to treat tumors across \nthe lineage plasticity continuum.\n\nDOI: 10.1172/JCI187490\nPMCID: PMC12126232\nPMID: 40454483 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Despite progress in \nprevention and success in early detection through cytologic screening and human \npapillomavirus (HPV) detection, there remains a challenge in triaging women \nappropriately to colposcopy and biopsy. We sought to validate the CervicalMethDx \ntest, a precision DNA methylation classifier for cervical cancer detection, as a \nreflex test in women with HPV-positive samples. A blinded retrospective study \nwas performed on well-characterized samples in PreservCyt media from a large \nreferral clinical laboratory in the United States. DNA methylation was assessed \nin three gene promoters (ZNF516, FKBP6, and INTS1) and a control gene (β-actin) \nby quantitative real-time methylation-specific PCR (qMSP) analysis, using \nmachine learning algorithms. We compared DNA methylation levels in HPV-positive \npatients presenting with lesions in the Pap test and cervical intraepithelial \nneoplasia grade 2 (CIN2) or CIN3 histologic diagnosis with DNA methylation \nlevels in HPV-positive patients with lesions in the Pap test but no \nintraepithelial lesion or malignancy. The CervicalMethDx test correctly \nclassified 95% of the CIN2 samples (n = 210), with 91% sensitivity, 100% \nspecificity, and an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.96, and 94% of CIN3 \nsamples (n = 141), with 90% sensitivity, 100% specificity, and an AUC of 0.96. \nMoreover, the CervicalMethDx test correctly classified 94% of combined CIN2/CIN3 \nsamples (n = 351), with 93% sensitivity, 97% specificity, and an AUC of 0.96. \nCervicalMethDx demonstrated strong discriminatory power for identifying \nCIN2/CIN3 risk and may complement current triage strategies for colposcopy \nreferral. Prospective, population-based studies, including those in low-resource \nsettings, are needed for further evaluation.\nPREVENTION RELEVANCE: The CervicalMethDx test integrates DNA methylation \nanalysis and machine learning to improve early detection of high-grade cervical \nlesions (high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions), offering a noninvasive, \ncost-effective screening tool. Enhanced risk stratification and overtreatment \nreduction expand equitable access to precision prevention programs. Further \nvalidation will clarify CervicalMethDx's alignment with global cervical cancer \nprevention strategies.\n\n©2025 The Authors; Published by the American Association for Cancer Research.\n\nDOI: 10.1158/1940-6207.CAPR-25-0029\nPMCID: PMC12402793\nPMID: 40439417 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: D.

However, the role \nof CAFs derived exosomes in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) environment is \nunexplored. PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) serve as epigenetic effectors in \ncancer progression and constitute significant compositions of exosomes. Here, we \nexplored the functional mechanism of exosomal piRNAs in OSCC development.\nMETHODS: We screened exosomal piRNAs derived from CAFs and normal fibroblasts \n(NFs) and assess their effect on tumor proliferation and metastasis. A nude \nmouse model was established to assess the impact of exosomal piR-35462 on tumor \nprogression.\nRESULTS: CAFs-derived exosomes showed an enhanced piR-35462 expression and \npromoted OSCC cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Additionally, elevated \npiR-35462 expression in OSCC tissues correlates with poor prognosis. \nMechanistically, CAFs-derived exosomal piR-35462 increased the expression of fat \nmass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) in OSCC cells. By inhibiting \nN6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA methylation, the overexpression of FTO further \nenhances the stability and expression levels of Twist1 mRNA, thereby \ncontributing to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and tumor progression. \nIn vivo xenograft tumor model also confirmed the same results.\nCONCLUSION: The achieved outcomes elucidate that CAFs can deliver piR-35462 \ncontaining exosomes to OSCC cells and promote OSCC progression via FTO/Twist \nmediated EMT pathways, and could represent a promising therapeutic target for \nOSCC.\n\n© 2025.

This study aimed \nto develop an integrated epigenetic-based classification system and evaluate its \nprognostic value.\nMETHODS: We performed multi-omics analysis on five independent cohorts totaling \n1,103 AML patients. The Cancer Genome Atlas-Acute Myeloid Leukemia (TCGA-LAML) \ncohort (n = 83) provided comprehensive multi-omics data including DNA \nmethylation profiles (Illumina 450K platform), RNA sequencing (mRNA, lncRNA, and \nmiRNA), and somatic mutation profiles. The BEAT (n = 649), TARGET (n = 156), \nGSE12417 (n = 79), and GSE37642 (n = 136) cohorts contributed transcriptome \ndata. Molecular subtypes were identified using empirical Bayes-based clustering \non the TCGA cohort. LSC17 scores were calculated using a validated 17-gene \nexpression signature. A random survival forest model was developed integrating \nmolecular features with LSC17 scores, validated across all cohorts. Immune \nmicroenvironment analysis employed multiple deconvolution methods (ESTIMATE, \nCIBERSORT, xCell) and pathway analysis (GSVA, GSEA). Drug sensitivity was \npredicted using the pRRophetic algorithm with GDSC database reference.\nRESULTS: Multi-omics integration revealed two molecularly distinct AML subtypes \nwith significant survival differences (CS2 vs CS1, P < 0.001). The random \nsurvival forest model, incorporating 20 key epigenetic features (including \nCPNE8, CD109, and CHRDL1) and LSC17 scores, achieved superior prognostic \naccuracy (C-index: 0.72-0.78) across validation cohorts. Both epigenetic risk \nscore (HR = 2.45, 95%CI: 1.86-3.24) and LSC17 score (HR = 1.89, 95%CI: \n1.42-2.51) maintained independent prognostic value in multivariate analysis. \nIntegration of both scores in a nomogram improved 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival \npredictions (C-index: 0.81). High-risk patients exhibited distinct immune \nprofiles with elevated M2 macrophages (1.8-fold) and Tregs (2.3-fold), while \nlow-risk patients showed enhanced NK cell activity (2.1-fold). Drug sensitivity \nanalysis identified differential responses to epigenetic regulators (LAQ824, \nP = 0.000139; MS-275, P = 0.00104) and proteasome inhibitors (Bortezomib, \nP = 0.00747; MG-132, P = 0.0106) between risk groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: This integrated classification system combining epigenetic features \nand stem cell signatures provides new insights into AML heterogeneity and \ntherapeutic targeting. The complementary nature of epigenetic and stem \ncell-related prognostic factors suggests potential for improved risk \nstratification in clinical practice. Future prospective validation studies are \nwarranted to confirm these findings.\n\nCopyright: © 2025 Li, Wang.

Thus, we explored how changes found in patient-derived lung cancer \ncell lines impacted influenza virus replication and identified two lines with \nopposite responses to influenza A viral infection. We show that the NCI-H820 \nlung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is resistant to influenza A virus and VSV infection, \nwhile LUAD line NCI-H322 is highly susceptible to infection by both viruses. \nH322 cells have a homozygous deletion in a region of chromosome 9 encoding \nIFNαgenes, IFNβ1, IFNω1, and IFNε genes, leading to downregulation of immune \nresponse and high infection rates. In contrast, the resistant H820 cell line has \nthree copies of these same interferon genes and shows increased expression of \ninterferon-regulated genes. We found that the resistance of H820 cells to \ninfluenza infection is likely linked to impaired viral entry-due to high basal \nlevels of interferon-induced proteins known to inhibit endocytosis (IFITM1/2/3, \nNCOA7, and CH25H)-and to increased expression of mRNAs that encode other \nantiviral factors. In contrast, H322 cells show the absence or low levels of \ninterferon-regulated genes involved in the inhibition of viral entry. These \nresults suggest that the opposite phenotypes on viral entry of H322 and H820 \ncells may be at least in part associated with impaired or enhanced interferon \nresponse, respectively. Since most lung cancer patients have genomic \ncharacterization of their tumors, individualized differences in interferon \nresponses may have therapeutic and patient management implications.\nIMPORTANCE: Lung cancers develop from genetic and epigenetic changes that can \ndramatically influence patients' susceptibility to viral infection and \nreplication. This study evaluates the responses to influenza virus infection of \ntwo patient-derived lung cancer cell lines. Interestingly, the cell lines \ninvestigated are of the same cancer type, lung adenocarcinomas, yet one cell \nline is highly susceptible, while the other cell line is highly resistant to \nviral infection. This is in part due to contrasting genetic alterations that \nlead to changes in the interferon response pathways, which differentially impact \nviral entry. Thus, identifying these risk factors can inform the prognosis of \npatients infected with influenza virus and guide their personalized treatment \nplans.\n\nDOI: 10.1128/jvi.00469-25\nPMCID: PMC12172473\nPMID: 40434103 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The A.G.-S. laboratory has received research \nsupport from GSK, Pfizer, Senhwa Biosciences, Kenall Manufacturing, Blade \nTherapeutics, Avimex, Johnson and Johnson, Dynavax, 7Hills Pharma, Pharmamar, \nImmunityBio, Accurius, Nanocomposix, Hexamer, N-fold LLC, Model Medicines, Atea \nPharma, Applied Biological Laboratories, and Merck, outside of the reported \nwork.

Electronic address: utpal.sen@louisville.edu.\n\nGut microbes play an immense role in digesting ingested food, providing \nnutrients to the host, and producing several bioactive metabolites that not only \nhelp maintain health but can also elicit disease during dysbiotic conditions. \nThe bioactive compounds derived from gut microbiota metabolites include \ntrimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), uremic toxins, short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), \nphytoestrogens, anthocyanins, bile acids, lipopolysaccharide - to name a few. \nOnce these compounds enter the host cells, tissues, and organs they can cause \ndiseases such as epigenetic, metabolic, neurodegenerative, psychiatric, \ncardiovascular, hypertension, respiratory, gastrointestinal, kidney, bone, \ncancer, and others. Regulating healthy gut microbiota thus provides a potential \noption for the prevention, reversal, or even treatment of these diseases. \nTowards this end, various interventional strategies are postulated in this field \nof emerged and rapidly expanding health research arena that includes fecal \nmicrobiota transplantation, prebiotics, and probiotics, and to introduce the \nconcept that correcting gut dysbiosis can ameliorate disease symptoms, thus \noffering a new approach towards dysbiosis-related disease mitigation and \ntreatment. In the special issue of Pharmacological Research titled \"Gut \nMicrobiota and Well-Being,\" several outstanding research findings and review \narticles are published, covering a broad spectrum of topics related to the \ninfluence of gut microbiota on health and disease.

Capture-HiC is an assay \nthat links fine-mapped risk variants to candidate target genes by \ncomprehensively mapping chromatin interactions. We performed a melanoma GWAS \nregion-focused capture-HiC assay in human primary melanocytes to identify \nphysical interactions between fine-mapped risk variants and potential causal \nmelanoma-susceptibility genes. Overall, chromatin-interaction data alone \nnominated potential causal genes for 61 of the 68 melanoma risk signals, \nidentifying many candidates beyond those reported by previous studies. We \nfurther integrated these data with epigenomic (chromatin state, accessibility), \ngene expression (expression quantitative trait locus [eQTL]/transcriptome-wide \nassociation study [TWAS]), DNA methylation (methylation QTL \n[meQTL]/methylome-wide association study [MWAS]), and massively parallel \nreporter assay (MPRA) data generated from melanoma-relevant cell types to \nprioritize potentially cis-regulatory variants and their respective candidate \ngene targets. From the set of fine-mapped variants across these loci, we \nidentified 140 prioritized credible causal variants linked to 195 candidate \ngenes at 42 risk signals. In addition, we developed an integrative scoring \nsystem to facilitate candidate gene prioritization, integrating melanocyte and \nmelanoma datasets. Notably, at several GWAS risk signals, we observed long-range \nchromatin connections (500 kb to >1 Mb) with distant candidate target genes. We \nvalidated several such cis-regulatory interactions using CRISPR inhibition, \nproviding evidence for known cancer driver genes MDM4 and CBL, as well as the \nSRY-box transcription factor SOX4, as likely melanoma risk genes.\n\nPublished by Elsevier Inc.\n\nDOI: 10.1016/j.ajhg.2025.04.015\nPMCID: PMC12256899\nPMID: 40409268 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: Declaration of interests The authors declare no \ncompeting interests."

Although heavy alcohol consumption (HAC) frequently \naccompanies smoking, the relationship of HAC to overall mortality in those at \nrisk for LC is not well known. Determining the contribution of HAC to mortality \nin those who smoke is important because HAC is also a major driver of mortality \nand is potentially treatable. To help answer this question, we examined the \nrelationship of epigenetic biomarkers of smoking (cg05575921) and chronic heavy \nalcohol consumption (Alcohol T Score, ATS) in a cohort of 92 LC cases and 402 \nage, sex, ethnicity and smoking history matched controls from the Prostate, \nLung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Screening Trial to all-cause mortality using \nproportional hazards survival analysis. We found that ATS values significantly \npredicted risk for all-cause mortality in those smokers who developed (p < 0.03) \nand did not develop lung cancer (p < 0.0001). When mortality data were analyzed \nusing median splits, those who did and did not incur lung cancer with ATS values \n<3.6 lived 5.6 years and 3.2 years more, respectfully, than those with ATS \nvalues >3.6. Interestingly, in this group of 494 smokers or former smokers, \nafter adjusting for the occurrence of lung cancer, cg05575921 methylation did \nnot predict mortality. In summary, we found that excessive alcohol consumption \nis a significant risk factor for all-cause mortality in those at risk for LC and \nsuggest that lung cancer screening efforts to address problem drinking could \nincrease survival.\n\nCopyright: © 2025 Philibert et al.

To understand the \nintergenerational effect of maternal obesity, we hypothesized that the maternal \nobesity effect is mediated by epigenetic changes in the CD34+/CD38-/Lin- \nhematopoietic stem cells (uHSCs) in the offspring. To investigate this, we \nconducted a DNA methylation centric multiomics study. We measured DNA \nmethylation and gene expression of the CD34+/CD38-/Lin- uHSCs and metabolomics \nof the cord blood, all from a multiethnic cohort from Kapiolani Medical Center \nfor Women and Children in Honolulu, Hawaii (n=72, collected between 2016 and \n2018).\nRESULTS: Differential methylation analysis unveiled a global hypermethylation \npattern in the maternal prepregnancy obese group (BH adjusted P < 0.05), after \nadjusting for major clinical confounders. KEGG pathway enrichment, WGCNA, and \nPPI analyses revealed that hypermethylated CpG sites were involved in critical \nbiological processes, including cell cycle, protein synthesis, immune signaling, \nand lipid metabolism. Utilizing Shannon entropy on uHSCs methylation, we \ndiscerned notably higher quiescence of uHSCs impacted by maternal obesity. \nAdditionally, the integration of multiomics data-including methylation, gene \nexpression, and metabolomics-provided further evidence of dysfunctions in \nadipogenesis, erythropoietin production, cell differentiation, and DNA repair, \naligning with the findings at the epigenetic level. Furthermore, we trained a \nrandom forest classifier using the CpG sites in the genes of the top pathways \nassociated with maternal obesity, and applied it to predict cancer versus \nadjacent normal sample labels in 14 Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cancer types. \nFive of 14 cancers showed balanced accuracy of 0.6 or higher: LUSC (0.87), PAAD \n(0.83), KIRC (0.71), KIRP (0.63) and BRCA (0.60).\nCONCLUSIONS: This study revealed the significant correlation between \nprepregnancy maternal obesity and multiomics-level molecular changes in the \nuHSCs of offspring, particularly at the DNA methylation level. These \nmaternal-obesity-associated epigenetic markers in uHSCs may contribute to \nincreased risks in certain cancers of the offspring. Larger and multicenter \ncohort validation studies are warranted to follow up the current single-site \nstudy.\n\n© The Author(s) 2025.

While more than 50% of colorectal cancers \ndevelop liver metastases, HERV has not been studied in this context.\nMETHODS: We collected 400 RNA-seq samples from over 200 patients with primary \nand liver metastases, including public data and a novel set of 200 samples.\nFINDINGS: We observed global stability of HERV expression between liver \nmetastases and primary colorectal cancers, suggesting an early oncogenic \nfootprint. We identified a list of 17 HERV loci for liver metastatic colorectal \ncancer (lmCRC) characterization; with tumour-specificity validated in \nsingle-cell metastatic colorectal cancer data and normal tissue bulk RNA-seq. \nEleven loci produced HERV-derived peptides as per tandem mass spectrometry from \nprimary colorectal cancer. Six loci were associated with the risk of relapse \nafter lmCRC surgery. Four, HERVH_Xp22.32a, HERVH_20p11.23b, HERVH_13q33.3, \nHERVH_13q31.3, had adverse prognostic value (log-rank p-value 0.028, 0.0083, \n9e-4, 0.05, respectively) while two, HERVH_Xp22.2c (log-rank p-value 0.032) and \nHERVH_8q21.3b (in multivariable models) were associated with better prognosis. \nMoreover, the markers showed a cumulative effect on survival when expressed. \nSome were associated with decreased cytotoxic immune cells and most of them \ncorrelated with cell cycle pathways.\nINTERPRETATION: These findings provide insights into the lmCRC transcriptome \nlandscape by suggesting prognostic markers and potential therapeutic targets.\nFUNDING: This work was supported by funding from institutional grants from \nInserm, EFS, University of Bourgogne Franche-Comté, national found \"Agence \nNationale de la Recherche - ANR-JCJC: Projet HERIC and ANR-22-CE45-0007\", and \n\"La ligue contre le cancer\".\n\nCopyright © 2025 The Authors.

Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor \n(EGFR-TKI) treatment is widely used clinically because the epidermal growth \nfactor receptor (EGFR) is the main driver gene of lung cancer; however, the \ndevelopment of drug resistance is inevitable. Epigenetic abnormalities can also \nlead to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) resistance. However, the relationship \nbetween N6-methyladenosine (m6A)-related proteins and EGFR mutations in NSCLC \nand their clinical significance remain unclear. In this retrospective study, the \nexpression of m6A-related regulatory factors in patients with EGFR mutations \nwere analyzed to investigate their relationship with clinicopathological \nfeatures and prognoses.MethodsThe association between m6A-related regulatory \nfactors and NSCLC was analyzed using data derived from The Cancer Genome Atlas, \ncase collection, follow-up, immunohistochemistry, and scoring.ResultsA total of \n246 NSCLC specimens were examined in this study. Among these, 143 EGFR-mutant \ncases exhibited significantly higher expression of METTL3 and ALKBH5 compared to \nEGFR-wildtype specimens. The median progression-free survival time of patients \nwith high METTL3 expression (SI >6) was 25.0 months, and that of patients with \nhigh ALKBH5 expression (SI >6) was 24.1 months in EGFR-mutant cases. High METTL3 \nand ALKBH5 expression levels are independent risk factors for progression-free \nsurvival in patients with EGFR mutations. The median progression-free survival \ntime of patients with EGFR mutations was 45.7 months in those with high \nexpression of METTL3 or ALKBH5 alone, whereas it decreased to 20.1 months in \nthose with high simultaneous expression of METTL3 and ALKBH5.ConclusionsMETTL3 \nand ALKBH5 were upregulated in NSCLC tissues with EGFR mutations and \nsignificantly correlated with poor prognoses. Thus, METTL3 and ALKBH5 may serve \nas prognostic biomarkers in EGFR-mutant NSCLC.\n\nPlain Language Summary: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which accounts for \n>85% of all lung cancers, is the most common solid malignant tumor with high \nmorbidity and mortality worldwide. Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine \nkinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) treatment is widely used clinically because the \nepidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is the main driver gene of lung cancer; \nhowever, drug resistance is inevitable. Epigenetic abnormalities can also lead \nto tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) resistance. However, the relationship between \nN6-methyladenosine (m6A)-related proteins and EGFR mutations in NSCLC and their \nclinical significance remain unclear. In this retrospective study, the \nexpression of m6A-related regulatory factors in patients with EGFR mutations \nwere analyzed to explain their relationship with clinicopathological features \nand prognoses. A total of 246 NSCLC specimens were examined in this study. Among \nthese, 143 EGFR-mutant cases exhibited significantly higher expression of METTL3 \nand ALKBH5 compared to EGFR-wildtype specimens. The median progression-free \nsurvival time of patients with high METTL3 expression (SI >6) was 25.0 months, \nand that of patients with high ALKBH5 expression (SI >6) was 24.1 months in \nEGFR-mutant cases.

For the first \ntime, we investigated the presence of KMT9α in cholangiocarcinoma, the \nassociation with histologic subtypes, and its impact on survival.\nMETHODS: A tissue microarray cohort of all CCA patients who underwent surgical \nresection with curative intent between 08/2005 and 12/2021 at the University \nHospital Frankfurt was immunohistochemically analyzed with the KMT9α antibody. \nFor overall survival, Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox-regression analyses were \nperformed.\nRESULTS: In total, 174 patients were suitable for IHC analysis. Of the patients, \n35.1% (n = 61) overexpressed KMT9α. Kaplan-Meier curves revealed a median OS of \n34.75 months (95% CI = 20.23-49.27 months) for all CCA patients positive for \nKMT9α in comparison to 54.21 months (95% CI = 41.78-66.63 months) for patients \nlacking KMT9α overexpression (p = 0.004). Subtype analysis revealed strong \ndifferences in KMT9α expression. Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified \nKMT9α as an independent risk factor for shorter OS in CCA.\nCONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that a marked subset of CCA patients exhibit \noverexpression of KMT9α. These findings underscore the prognostic significance \nof KMT9α and reinforce its potential as a therapeutic target, consistent with \nits role in other cancer types.\n\n© 2025.

Increased \ncancer risk among firefighters may be partly attributable to increased \noccupational exposure to a range of chemicals, including per- and \npolyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Some PFAS are known and suspect human \ncarcinogens. Investigating epigenetic response to these PFAS exposures in \nfirefighters may help to identify biological pathways of specific cancers, and \npreviously unidentified health outcomes that are associated with PFAS. We \ntherefore investigated the associations of serum PFAS concentrations with miRNA \nexpression in firefighters. Serum samples collected from 303 firefighters from 6 \nsites across the USA were analyzed for 9 PFAS along with miRNA expression. \nCovariate-adjusted linear regression was used to estimate associations between \nlog PFAS and miRNA expression, with false discovery rate (FDR) set to 0.05 for \nsignificance, and an exploratory cutoff of FDR q < 0.20. Gene set enrichment \nanalysis (GSEA) was performed using miRTarBase's miRWalk pathways. Age, \nrace-ethnicity, BMI, fire department, and sex were controlled for in all models. \nAt FDR<0.05, the linear isomer of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) was \ninversely associated with miR-128-1-5p expression (Beta = -0.146, 95 % CI \n-0.216, -0.076). At a relaxed FDR of 0.20, we observed inverse associations for \nthe sum of branched isomers of PFOS (Sm-PFOS) with 5 miRNAs (let-7d-5p, \nlet-7a-5p, miR-423-5p, let-7b-5p, miR-629-5p). Several pathways were enriched \nfor multiple PFAS, including those correlated with certain cancers, blood \ndiseases, thyroid disorders, autoimmune disorders, and neurological outcomes. \nSome PFAS in firefighters were found to be associated with alteration of miRNA \nconsistent with increased risk for a range of chronic diseases.\n\nCopyright © 2025 The Authors.

This study \ninvestigated the effects of miR-184 promoter demethylation on EPB41L5 expression \nand Notch signaling in CRC. SW620 human colon carcinoma cells were treated with \nthe DNA methylation inhibitor 5-Aza for 96 h. Methylation status was assessed \nvia bisulfite sequencing, and gene expression was evaluated using qRT-PCR and \nWestern blotting. Functional assays were conducted to assess cell proliferation, \napoptosis, migration, and invasion. 5-Aza treatment significantly decreased \nmiR-184 promoter methylation, leading to increased miR-184 expression. This \nupregulation suppressed CRC cell migration and invasion, induced G2/M cell cycle \narrest, and promoted apoptosis. Mechanistically, miR-184 inhibited EPB41L5 \nexpression, thereby downregulating the Notch signaling pathway and modulating \nepithelial-mesenchymal transition markers. High EPB41L5 expression in CRC \ntissues was associated with worse prognosis. These findings suggest that \ndemethylated miR-184 inhibits CRC metastasis by targeting the EPB41L5/Notch \nsignaling axis. This regulatory pathway may serve as a novel prognostic \nbiomarker and therapeutic target, with potential clinical implications for the \nprevention and treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer.\n\n© 2025.

In 10% of these children, this manifests as a family \nhistory of Wilms tumor or bilateral disease. The frequency and spectrum of \nunderlying changes have not been systematically investigated.\nMETHODS: We analyzed 129 children with suspected Wilms tumor predisposition, 20 \nfamilial cases, and 109 children with bilateral disease, enrolled over 30 years \nin the German SIOP93-01/GPOH and SIOP2001 studies. We used whole exome, whole \ngenome, and targeted DNA sequencing, together with MLPA and targeted methylation \nassays on tumor, blood, and normal kidney to determine predisposing changes.\nRESULTS: Predisposing variants were identified in 117/129 children, comprising \nDNA variants (57%) and epigenetic changes (34%). Most children had \npredisposition variants in genes previously implicated in Wilms tumor: most \nprominently WT1 (n = 35) and less frequently TRIM28, REST, DIS3L2, CTR9, DICER1, \nCDC73, and NONO. Nine children carried germline mutations in cancer \npredisposition genes not considered Wilms tumor predisposition genes, such as \nCHEK2, CDKN2A, BLM, BRCA2, STK11, and FMN2. Predisposition via epigenetic \nBWS-IC1 alterations occurred as early somatic events, reflected by partial \n(mosaic) loss of imprinting or loss of heterozygosity at the IGF2/H19 locus in \nnormal kidney or blood. These patients rarely had a clinical diagnosis of \nBeckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS). Especially WT1-driven tumors follow a \nstereotypical pathway of germline WT1 mutations becoming homozygous in renal \nprecursor lesions through 11p LOH, which concomitantly activates imprinted IGF2 \nexpression, with subsequent WNT pathway activation leading to tumor growth. \nThere is a high rate of multicentric tumors, which may have previously been \nmissed in unilateral tumors. While Wilms tumor predisposition genes relied on \nsomatic inactivation of the second allele, this was different for general cancer \npredisposition genes. The latter cases were often associated with additional \noncogenic alterations, similar to tumors with epigenetic predisposition.\nCONCLUSIONS: We identified two main mechanisms of Wilms tumor predisposition: \neither germline genetic alterations of Wilms tumor and, less frequently, general \ncancer genes; or postzygotic mosaic imprinting defects activating IGF2. These \nfindings inform future genetic screening and risk assessment of affected \nchildren and lend support to liquid biopsy screening for enhanced therapeutic \nstratification.\n\n© 2025.

Notably, \ncancer-type-specific DNA methylation can be advantageous for survival only in \nspecific environments while being disadvantageous in others. To investigate the \nrole of cancer-type-specific methylation as a vulnerability in cancer cells, we \nbioinformatically profiled genome-wide DNA methylation in 1165 human cancer cell \nlines across 25 cancer types. The number of cancer-type-specific methylated \ncytosines varied significantly by organ, with exceptionally high numbers \nobserved in blood cancers. A total of 73 genes were identified as potential \nliver cancer-specific methylation-silenced genes, and four genes, ASNS, NQO1, \nFXYD5, and BCAT2, were subjected to experimental further analysis. Silencing of \nBCAT2 was found to contribute to the vulnerability of liver cancer cells to \nBCAT1 inhibition by gabapentin. Additionally, the silencing of the other three \ngenes also rendered liver cancer cells vulnerable under different environmental \nconditions.

Liver cancer data were \nsourced from FinnGen. Mendelian randomization (MR) was used to assess causal \nrelationships between lipid traits and liver cancer. Functional analyses \nincluded protein-protein interaction (PPI), KEGG pathway enrichment, \ntranscription factor (TF) network analysis, and survival analysis.

Drug target MR indicated that NPC1L1 \ninhibition (OR = 1.0638, p = 0.0311) and elevated PPARɑ levels (OR = 1.1339, \np < 0.01) increased liver cancer risk. Functional analysis revealed NPC1L1 was \nhighly expressed in liver cancer tissues due to hypomethylation and linked to \nimmune cell infiltration, indicating its role in immune evasion and tumor \nprogression.\nCONCLUSION: The study demonstrates that elevated LDL-C levels are associated \nwith a reduced risk of liver cancer and NPC1L1 plays a key role in regulating \nlipid metabolism and influencing immune evasion.\n\n© 2025 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and John Wiley & \nSons Australia, Ltd.\n\nDOI: 10.1111/jgh.16897\nPMID: 40312834 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Single-nucleotide \npolymorphisms (SNPs) have become key tools in the study of cancer genetics, \ninfluencing susceptibility and prognosis. Methods: In the present study, we \nanalysed the relationship between five SNPs on the PDCDL1 gene (rs822336, \nrs822337, rs822338, rs229736, rs4143815) with prognosis as well as primary \ntumour invasiveness characteristics in 377 whole blood samples from MM \nindividuals. Results: Patients who presented the rs822336 CG or GG genotypes (OR \n= 3.01, 95% CI = 1.53-5.92; p = 0.0017), TA or TT in rs822337 (OR = 2.45, 95% CI \n= 1.22-4.93; p = 0.0098), and CT or CC of rs822338 (OR = 2.23, 95% CI = \n1.05-4.73; p = 0.028) were at an increased risk of developing invasive \nmelanomas. Cases with the AG or GG genotype in rs2297136 presented a lower risk \n(OR = 0.29, 95% CI = 0.11-0.75; p = 0.0038) of invasive MM. The genetic analysis \nat the haplotype level resulted in similar findings (OR: 2.95, 95% CI: \n1.08-8.10), p = 0.036). Furthermore, patients carrying the homozygous AA \ngenotype in rs2297136 had thicker tumours than those harbouring the AG or GG \n(1.4 mm vs. 1.0 and 0.8 mm; p = 0.030). No significant association was found \nbetween the studied SNPs and melanoma-specific survival (MSS) nor \nprogression-free survival (PFS). Conclusions: Current results suggest that SNPs \nrs822336, rs822337, rs822338, and rs2297136 genotypes in the PDCDL1 gene are \nassociated with the risk of tumour invasiveness and tumour thickness in MM. \nFurther studies on SNPs considering genetic and epigenetic factors are needed \nfor a better understanding of malignant melanoma susceptibility and its \nprognosis.\n\nDOI: 10.3390/biom15040584\nPMCID: PMC12024702\nPMID: 40305358 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare no conflicts of interest."

To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying this aggressive \nphenotype, we performed comprehensive multi-omics profiling to delineate the \ndistinct features of EOCRC, with a focus on key drivers of metastatic and \ninvasive potential.\nMETHODS: We initially characterized the genome, epigenome, and transcriptome of \ntumors from 515 (69 EOCRC and 446 late-onset CRC [LOCRC]) cases in The Cancer \nGenome Atlas. Key candidate molecules were further validated using RNA-seq and \nscRNA-seq data. Multi-omics profiling revealed PIWIL1/piRNA as a hallmark of \nEOCRC, with further validation through in vitro functional assays, \ntranscriptomic profiling, and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.\nRESULTS: EOCRC demonstrated a mutational landscape similar to that of LOCRC, \nwith comparable oncogenic driver mutations and somatic copy-number alterations. \nHowever, EOCRC exhibited a higher frequency of deletion in chromosomes 6, 15, \nand 19 regions, along with metabolic reprogramming favoring aerobic glycolysis \nand lipid metabolism. Integrative transcriptomic and DNA methylation analyses \nidentified six EOCRC-specific molecules, including PIWIL1. Notably, PIWIL1 was \nmainly expressed in epithelial cells, with lower expression in EOCRC versus \nLOCRC. Its downstream piRNAs (FR019019, FR019089, and FR132045) were also \ndownregulated in EOCRC. Functional experiments demonstrated that \nFR019089/FR019019 overexpression suppressed migration and invasion. Clinically, \nlow FR019089 levels correlated with significantly shorter progression-free and \noverall survival in EOCRC patients. Additionally, downstream pathways of \nFR019089 and FR019019 overexpression were enriched in anti-cancer-related \nsignaling pathways.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our multi-omics approach yields novel insights into the molecular \nunderpinnings of EOCRC and we characterize the role of PIWIL1-associated piRNAs \nin modulating EOCRC metastasis and invasion. FR019089 shows promise as a \nprognostic biomarker with potential clinical utility in the risk stratification \nand management of EOCRC patients.\n\n© 2025.

While ΔΨm loss and its consequences are \nwell studied, little is known about the effects of mitochondrial \nhyperpolarization. In this study, we used cells deleted of ATP5IF1 (IF1), a \nnatural inhibitor of the hydrolytic activity of the ATP synthase, as a genetic \nmodel of increased resting ΔΨm. We found that the nuclear DNA hypermethylates \nwhen the ΔΨm is chronically high, regulating the transcription of mitochondrial, \ncarbohydrate and lipid genes. These effects can be reversed by decreasing the \nΔΨm and recapitulated in wild-type (WT) cells exposed to environmental chemicals \nthat cause hyperpolarization. Surprisingly, phospholipid changes, but not redox \nor metabolic alterations, linked the ΔΨm to the epigenome. Sorted hyperpolarized \nWT and ovarian cancer cells naturally depleted of IF1 also showed phospholipid \nremodeling, indicating this as an adaptation to mitochondrial hyperpolarization. \nThese data provide a new framework for how mitochondria can impact epigenetics \nand cellular biology to influence health outcomes, including through chemical \nexposures and in disease states.\n\n© 2025.

Variants of the MTHFR gene have been associated with \nvarying susceptibility to brain tumors, particularly gliomas. This study aimed \nto investigate the role of MTHFR genotypes in determining brain tumor risk in \nTaiwan.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: In this hospital-based case-control study, we assessed \nthe contribution of MTHFR C677T (rs1801133) and A1298C (rs1801131) genotypes to \nbrain tumor risk. A total of 52 patients with brain tumor and 520 age- and \nsex-matched non-cancer healthy controls were included. Genotyping of MTHFR \nrs1801133 and rs1801131 was performed using polymerase chain \nreaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP).\nRESULTS: Our findings revealed a significant difference in the genotypic \ndistribution of MTHFR rs1801131 between brain tumor cases and non-cancer \ncontrols (p for trend=0.0099). Specifically, individuals with the MTHFR \nrs1801131 homozygous CC genotype demonstrated a 3.69-fold increased risk of \nbrain tumors [95% confidence interval (95%CI)=1.52-9.00, p=0.0062]. In contrast, \nthe AC genotype did not show a statistically significantly increased risk [odds \nratio (OR)=1.54, 95%CI=0.83-2.85, p=0.2278]. Allelic frequency analysis revealed \nthat the C allele of MTHFR rs1801131 was associated with an elevated risk of \nbrain tumors (OR=1.83, 95%CI=1.20-2.80, p=0.0071). No significant association \nwas found for MTHFR rs1801133. Stratified analysis showed that the MTHFR \nrs1801131 CC genotype particularly increased the risk in individuals older than \n60 years (OR=4.68, 95%CI=1.42-15.42, p=0.0202) and in females (OR=3.79, \n95%CI=1.22-11.77, p=0.0410).\nCONCLUSION: The CC genotype of MTHFR rs1801131 may serve as a valuable marker \nfor brain tumor susceptibility. Stratifying patients with brain tumors based on \ntheir MTHFR genotypes could help identify individuals at high risk, enabling \nmore frequent monitoring and preventive measures to reduce the occurrence of \nbrain tumors in Taiwan.\n\nCopyright © 2025 International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J. \nDelinasios), All rights reserved.\n\nDOI: 10.21873/anticanres.17565\nPMID: 40295056 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

The aim of this study was to identify \ndysregulated miRNAs associated with periodontitis and pancreatic cancer, along \nwith their related genes, signaling pathways, and compounds.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: miRNA expression datasets for tissues affected by \nperiodontitis and pancreatic cancer were obtained from the Gene Expression \nOmnibus database. miRNAs differentially expressed relative to normal tissues \nwere detected, and those common to both datasets were determined. Further \nbioinformatics approaches were used to explore the association of common \ndifferentially expressed miRNAs with periodontitis and pancreatic cancer.\nRESULTS: Twenty shared, differentially expressed miRNAs were identified; 14 \nexhibited similar expression patterns in both diseases. Among these common \ndifferentially expressed miRNAs, 10 were found to be overexpressed. hsa-miR-155, \nhsa-miR-186, hsa-miR-765, hsa-miR-211 and hsa-miR-375 were the top miRNA nodes \nin the gene network, with hsa-mir-155 being the sole miRNA node in the \ntranscription factor network. Top candidate miRNA-dysregulated genes included \nsuperoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), nuclear FMR1 interacting protein 2 (NUFIP2), SFT2 \ndomain-containing 2 (SFT2D2), thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP), and \ncyclin D1 (CCND1), while top dysregulated transcription factors were Argonaute \nRISC catalytic component 2 (AGO2), AKT serine/threonine kinase 1 (AKT1), BCL6 \ntranscription repressor (BCL6), breakpoint cluster region (BCR), and BRCA1 DNA \nrepair associated (BRCA1). Relevant compounds for targeting these emerged, \nincluding 5-fluorouracil, gemcitabine, doxorubicin, ascorbate, \ndiethylstilbestrol, and temozolomide.\nCONCLUSION: Our study suggests candidate molecular mechanisms linking \nperiodontitis to pancreatic cancer, highlighting potential compounds that may \ntarget both diseases.

Dietary n-3 (ω-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), such \nas docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), may modulate \nbreast adipose fatty acids and downstream metabolites to counteract \nprocarcinogenic signaling in the mammary microenvironment.\nOBJECTIVES: We aimed to determine effects of ∼1 to 5 g/d EPA+DHA over 12 mo on \nbreast adipose fatty acid and oxylipin profiles in survivors of ERPR(-) breast \ncancer, a high-risk molecular subtype.\nMETHODS: We conducted a proof-of-concept 12-mo randomized double-blind trial \ncomparing ∼5 g/d and ∼1 g/d EPA+DHA supplementation in females within 5 y of \ncompleting standard therapy for ERPR(-) breast cancer Stages 0 to III. Blood and \nbreast adipose tissue specimens were collected every 3 mo for fatty acid, \noxylipin, and DNA methylation (DNAm) analyses.\nRESULTS: A total of 51 participants completed the 12-mo intervention. Study \ntreatments were generally well tolerated. Although both doses increased n-3 \nPUFAs from baseline in breast adipose, erythrocytes, and plasma, the 5 g/d \nsupplement was more potent with differences (% total fatty acids) of 0.76 (95% \nconfidence interval [CI]: 0.56, 0.96), 6.25 (95% CI: 5.02, 7.48), and 5.89 (95% \nCI: 4.53, 7.25), respectively. The 5 g/d dose also reduced plasma triglycerides \nfrom baseline, with changes (mg/dL) of 27.38 (95% CI: 10.99, 43.78) and 24.58 \n(95% CI: 9.05, 40.10) at 6 and 12 months, respectively. Breast adipose oxylipins \nshowed dose-dependent increases in DHA and EPA metabolites. Distinct DNAm \npatterns in adipose tissue after 12 mo suggest potential downregulation of \naberrant lipid metabolism pathways at the 5 g/d dose.\nCONCLUSIONS: Over 1 y, EPA+DHA dose-dependently increased breast adipose \nconcentrations of these fatty acids and their derivative oxylipin metabolites \nand produced differential DNAm profiles involved in metabolism-related pathways \ncritical to ERPR(-) breast cancer development. This distinct metabolic and \nepigenetic modulation of the breast microenvironment is achievable with \nhigh-dose n-3 PUFA supplementation.

This study investigated location-specific risk factors and the \nmediating role of LINE-1 DNA methylation in UC carcinogenesis. A hospital-based \ncase-control study was conducted, comprising 478 UC cases (266 UB, 204 UTUC) and \n569 controls. The risk factors, including smoking, Chinese herbal medicine use, \ncomorbidities, and blood levels of arsenic, cadmium, and lead, were assessed \nthrough questionnaires and blood sample analysis. LINE-1 DNA methylation levels \nwere measured by pyrosequencing. LASSO regression for variable selection and \nlogistic regression for risk assessment. Mediation analysis was performed to \nevaluate the role of LINE-1 DNA methylation in the relationship between \nenvironmental exposures and UC risk. UB risk was associated with male sex, \nsmoking, chronic kidney disease (CKD), elevated blood arsenic, and diabetes (all \np < 0.0001), while UTUC risk was primarily linked to female sex (p = 0.0004) and \nCKD (p < 0.0001). LINE-1 hypermethylation was associated with both UB and UTUC \nrisk (p < 0.0001). Notably, LINE-1 methylation significantly mediated the \nrelationship between smoking and UC risk, particularly in males, while no \nsignificant mediation was observed for other exposures. This study demonstrates \ndistinct risk profiles for UB and UTUC, and identifies LINE-1 methylation as a \nkey mediator in smoking-related UC risk, especially in men. These findings \nsuggest the need for location-specific prevention strategies and highlight the \nimportance of epigenetic mechanisms in UC development.\n\n© 2025.

KRAS mutations \nwere detected using real-time PCR; APC, KRAS, and TP53 protein levels were \nmeasured via ELISA. The results revealed that inflammatory indices (MLR, PLR, \nNLR) are increased in CRC patients, especially in those with advanced stages. \nTP53 protein levels were increased in patients with progressive cancer, whereas \nno significant difference was detected in the plasma levels of APC and KRAS. The \nG12V KRAS mutation was associated with a poor prognosis and high PLR values.

Electronic \naddress: junghwan.kim@gnu.ac.kr.\n\nThis pilot study introduces the concept of a \"redox clock,\" an NRF2-based \nepigenetic clock that reflects age-related changes in oxidative stress \nregulation. We examined CpG methylation of the NRF2 promoter across two \nindependent populations: 101 healthy participants (56 males, 45 females) from \nGyeongsang National University Hospital (GNUH) and 150 healthy participants (111 \nmales, 39 females) from the National Cancer Center (NCC). Methylation-sensitive \nHpaII restriction enzyme assays targeted three promoter regions (A, B, and C), \nwhile Illumina MethylationEPIC microarray analysis identified two specific CpG \nsites (cg03988329 and cg15484591) that correlated significantly with age \n(p < 0.01). Males, in particular, showed heightened CpG methylation in regions A \nand C with advancing age, alongside higher Ct values for NRF2 and HO-1 \ntranscripts, indicating reduced gene expression. Using these methylation \npatterns, we developed the \"redox clock\" to model accelerated aging (AA). \nNotably, this redox clock discriminated prediagnostic lung cancer cases from \nhealthy controls by revealing significantly greater AA in the cancer cohort, \nwhereas established epigenetic clocks (Horvath, Hannum, and PhenoAge) did not \ndetect this difference. These findings support CpG methylation of the NRF2 \npromoter, as captured by the redox clock, as a promising biomarker for \nbiological aging and potential risk assessment for age-related diseases such as \nlung cancer.\n\nCopyright © 2025 The Authors.

Identification of new \nprognostic biomarkers is a critical unmet need to improve treatment \ndecision-making. Epigenetic changes in cell-free DNA (cfDNA) have shown promise \nin early cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Thus, we aim to evaluate the potential \nof cfDNA methylation as a noninvasive predictor for prognostication in patients \nwith active, radiographically viable HCC.\nMETHODS: Using Illumina HumanMethylation450 array data of 377 HCC tumors and 50 \nadjacent normal tissues obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we \nidentified 158 HCC-related DNA methylation markers associated with overall \nsurvival (OS). This signature was further validated in 29 HCC tumor tissue \nsamples. Subsequently, we applied the signature to an independent cohort of 52 \npatients with plasma cfDNA samples by calculating the cfDNA methylation-based \nrisk score (methRisk) via random survival forest models with 10-fold \ncross-validation for the prognostication of OS.\nRESULTS: The cfDNA-based methRisk showed strong discriminatory power when \nevaluated as a single predictor for OS (3-year AUC = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.68-0.94). \nIntegrating the methRisk with existing risk indices like Barcelona clinic liver \ncancer (BCLC) staging significantly improved the noninvasive prognostic \nassessments for OS (3-year AUC = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.80-1), and methRisk remained an \nindependent predictor of survival in the multivariate Cox model (P = 0.007).\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study serves as a pilot study demonstrating that cfDNA \nmethylation biomarkers assessed from a peripheral blood draw can stratify HCC \npatients into clinically meaningful risk groups. These findings indicate that \ncfDNA methylation is a promising noninvasive prognostic biomarker for HCC, \nproviding a proof-of-concept for its potential clinical utility and laying the \ngroundwork for broader applications.\n\nCopyright: © 2025 Hu et al.

This study constructed a risk scoring model around histone methylation \nmodification regulators and conducted a multidimensional comprehensive analysis \nto reveal its potential role in breast cancer prognosis and drug sensitivity. \nFirst, 144 histone methylation modification regulators (HMMRs) were subjected to \ndifferential analysis and univariate Cox regression analysis, and nine \ndifferentially expressed HMMRs associated with survival were screened out. Next, \na risk scoring model consisting of eight HMMRs was constructed using the LASSO \nregression algorithm, exhibiting independent predictive values in training and \nvalidation cohorts. Then, immune analysis shows that patients in the high-risk \ngroup divided by the risk scoring model has weakened the immune response. In \naddition, through functional analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) \nbetween high-risk and low-risk groups, we confirmed that the DEGs mainly \naffected the nucleoplasm and tumour microenvironment. Finally, drug sensitivity \nanalysis demonstrated that our model could be useful for drug screening and \nidentify potential drugs for treating BRCA patients. In conclusion, these eight \nHMMRs may be key factors in the prognosis and drug sensitivity of BRCA patients.\n\n© 2025 The Author(s).

Faster \naging scores were also associated with increases in predicted healthcare costs \nover the next 5 years (β = 0.08; 95% CI, 0.03-0.13), 10 years (β = 0.23, 95% CI, \n0.15-0.31), and 15 years (β = 0.21; 95% CI, 0.11-0.30). Faster DunedinPACE aging \nscores were associated with greater risk for incident myocardial infarction \n(84%), stroke (38%), diabetes (56%), cancer (25%), liver disease (44%), and \nrenal disease (34%), as well as greater risk of mortality due to all-causes \n(38%) and chronic disease (74%).

HRR defects (HRD) identified by tests of \ngenomic instability confer PARP inhibitor sensitivity in ovarian cancers. \nCommercial tests that combine tumor BRCA testing with a genomic instability \nscore (HRD test) are available in clinical practice. We seek to determine the \nperformance of three different HRD tests to improve therapy management and \nprevention of ovarian cancer. Tumor samples from 50 patients with high-grade \novarian cancers were investigated for tumoral BRCA status, genomic instability, \nand BRCA1 promoter methylation for treatment purposes. Patients with ovarian \ncancer that tested positive for BRCA variants and/or genomic instability defect \nwere referred to the Cancer Genetics Service for germline testing. A positive \nHRD status was observed in 54% of cases, and pathogenic variants in BRCA genes \nwere identified in 41% of cases presenting genomic instability. BRCA1 \nmethylation assay revealed promoter hypermethylation in 20% of ovarian cancers \nthat tested positive for HRD and negative for BRCA1/2 variants. Among 26 women \nreferred to cancer genetic counseling, 10 carried germline variants in HRR \ngenes. HRD status determined eligibility for PARP inhibitor treatment in all but \ntwo ovarian cancers. This study outlines that determining genomic instability \nhelps identify inherited ovarian cancers. HRD testing, crucial for making \nhigh-grade ovarian cancer treatment choices, must be linked to an established \npath of cancer genetic counseling and management of individuals at high cancer \nrisk.\nPREVENTION RELEVANCE: Genomic instability status (HRD testing), which is \nessential for making therapy choices, is useful to identify inherited ovarian \ncancers.

This study aimed to assess the association of GAS5 rs145204276 \nins/del and CASC8 rs10505477 A>G polymorphisms with CRC risk in a Romanian \npopulation. A case-control study was conducted, including 156 CRC patients and \n195 healthy controls.

Specifically, in early-stage cases, recurrence after surgery \ncontinues to be the principal cause of death for these patients.

Some piRNAs, including hsa_piR_022710, \nhsa_piR_019822, and hsa_piR_020840, have been described as deregulated in \nvarious cancers.

Elevated expression of hsa_piR_019822 and \nhsa_piR_022710 was correlated with an increased risk of recurrence and poorer \nDFS and OS in LUSC patients. Patients with high hsa_piR_022710 expression more \ngreatly benefited from adjuvant treatment. In summary, higher piRNA levels were \nassociated with an increased risk of recurrence and poorer survival outcomes, \nespecially in LUSC patients, where they may help guide personalized treatment \nstrategies.\n\nDOI: 10.3390/ijms26072870\nPMCID: PMC11989015\nPMID: 40243460 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: All authors declare that they have no conflicts \nof interest to report regarding the present study."

Current post-surgery recurrence prediction methods are \nlimited, emphasizing the need for reliable biomarkers to assess recurrence risk. \nWe aimed to develop methylation-based markers for classifying HCC patients and \npredicting their risk of de novo recurrence post-surgery.\nMETHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we analyzed data from HCC patients \nwho underwent surgical resection in Korea, excluding those with recurrence \nwithin one year post-surgery. Using the Infinium Methylation EPIC array on 140 \nsamples in the discovery cohort, we classified patients into low- and high-risk \ngroups based on methylation profiles. Distinctive markers were identified \nthrough random forest analysis. These markers were validated in the cancer \ngenome atlas (n=217), Validation cohort 1 (n=63) and experimental Validation \nusing a methylation-sensitive high-resolution melting (MS-HRM) assay in \nValidation cohort 1 and Validation cohort 2 (n=63).\nRESULTS: The low-risk recurrence group (methylation group 1; MG1) showed a \nmethylation average of 0.73 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.69-0.77) with a \n23.5% recurrence rate, while the high-risk group (MG2) had an average of 0.17 \n(95% CI 0.14-0.20) with a 44.1% recurrence rate (P<0.03). Validation confirmed \nthe applicability of methylation markers across diverse populations, showing \nhigh accuracy in predicting the probability of HCC recurrence risk (area under \nthe curve 96.8%). The MS-HRM assay confirmed its effectiveness in predicting de \nnovo recurrence with 95.5% sensitivity, 89.7% specificity, and 92.2% accuracy.\nCONCLUSION: Methylation markers effectively classified HCC patients by de novo \nrecurrence risk, enhancing prediction accuracy and potentially offering \npersonalized management strategies.\n\nDOI: 10.3350/cmh.2024.0899\nPMCID: PMC12016632\nPMID: 40241383 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: Conflicts of Interest The authors have no \nconflicts to disclose."

DNA hypomethylation continues upon liver \nmetastasis. Here we examine 5hmC changes upon progression to liver metastasis.\nRESULTS: 5hmC is increased in metastatic liver tissue relative to the primary \ncolon tumour and expression of TET2 and TET3 is negatively correlated with risk \nfor metastasis in patients with CRC. Genes associated with increased \n5-hydroxymethylcytosine show KEGG enrichment for adherens junctions, \ncytoskeleton and cell migration around a core cadherin (CDH2) network. Overall, \nthe 5-hydroxymethylcyosine profile in the liver metastasis is similar to normal \ncolon appearing to recover at many loci where it was originally present in \nnormal colon and then spreading to adjacent sites. The underlying sequences at \nthe recover and spread regions are enriched for SALL4, ZNF770, ZNF121 and PAX5 \ntranscription factor binding sites. Finally, we show in a zebrafish migration \nassay using SW480 CRISPR-engineered TET knockout and rescue cells that reduced \nTET expression leads to a reduced migration frequency.\nCONCLUSIONS: Together these results suggest a biphasic trajectory for \n5-hydroxymethyation dynamics that has bearing on potential therapeutic \ninterventions aimed at manipulating 5-hydroxymethylcytosine levels.\n\n© 2025.

The epimutation burden in non-malignant tissues has been associated \nwith cancer risk in multiple cross-sectional studies.\nOBJECTIVE: To confirm the clinical usefulness of a DNA methylation marker for \nepimutation burden, and to identify a cut-off methylation level for a \nsuper-high-risk population.\nDESIGN: Healthy people after H. pylori eradication with open-type atrophy were \nprospectively recruited. DNA methylation levels of a marker gene, RIMS1, were \nmeasured in biopsy specimens from gastric antrum and body. The primary endpoint \nwas the incidence rate of gastric cancer in quartiles of the methylation levels.\nRESULTS: 1624 participants had at least one endoscopic follow-up with a median \nfollow-up of 4.05 years, and a primary gastric cancer developed in 27 \nparticipants. The highest quartile of RIMS1 methylation levels had a higher \nincidence rate (972.8 per 100 000 person-years) than the lowest quartile \n(127.1). Cox regression analysis revealed a univariate HR of 7.7 (95% CI \n1.8-33.7) and an age- and sex-adjusted HR of 5.7 (95% CI 1.3-25.5). As a \nsecondary objective, a cut-off methylation level of 25.7% (95% CI 1.7-7.7) was \nobtained to identify a population with a super-high risk based on the number \nneeded to screen of 1000.\nCONCLUSION: A DNA methylation marker can risk-stratify healthy people after H. \npylori eradication even though all of them have clinically high risk. \nIndividuals with super-high risk will need more frequent gastric cancer \nscreening than currently recommended.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: UMIN-CTR000016894.\n\n© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.

Increased exposure to toxicants on the fire ground, \nsuch as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, benzene, and per- and poly-fluoroalkyl \nsubstances (PFAS), has been linked to certain cancers, cardiovascular disease, \naccelerated epigenetic aging, and other adverse health effects. PFAS are a major \nconcern because they are persistent, can bioaccumulate, and are present in \nseveral firefighting tools. Compared to the general population, firefighters \nhave elevated serum levels of some types of PFAS. A randomized clinical trial in \nAustralian firefighters found that routine blood and plasma donation for 1 year \nled to decreased serum PFAS levels, although health outcomes were not directly \nmeasured in that study.\nOBJECTIVE: In collaboration with fire service leadership in Arizona, the \nFirefighter Collaborative Research Project (FCRP) was established to evaluate \nthe effectiveness of 3 interventions in a randomized controlled trial design to \nreduce serum PFAS levels, reduce cancer and cardiovascular risk, and improve \noverall health and wellness in US firefighters.\nMETHODS: This study aimed to recruit and enroll up to 1500 active firefighters \nbetween August 2023 and October 2024. Between August 2023 and October 2024, \nactive firefighters were recruited and randomized into a study arm based on \ntheir eligibility, including serum PFOS levels, for the specific arms. The trial \narms include (1) blood and plasma donation, (2) zone 2 physical activity, and \n(3) intermittent fasting. FCRP outcomes include serum PFAS reduction (arm 1), \nepigenetic age acceleration (all arms), cardiovascular conditioning (arm 2) and \ncognitive outcomes (all arms), mental health (all arms), and overall disease \nrisk (all arms). Each study arm includes an intervention and a control group. At \nenrollment and end of the study, participants provide blood and urine samples \nand complete a comprehensive questionnaire on their occupational and health \nhistory, exposures, and lifestyle behaviors. At the end of the study, \nparticipants also participated in a cognitive evaluation. Depending on the study \narm, participants may additionally complete a cardiopulmonary exercise test at \nbaseline and follow-up, a mid-study survey, and a mid-study blood and urine \ncollection.\nRESULTS: Participant activities and data collection will conclude by December \n2025.\nCONCLUSIONS: The FCRP is a randomized controlled trial that aims to test the \neffectiveness of fire service-selected interventions in reducing serum PFAS \nlevels. Study results will contribute to potential interventions that could be \nused to reduce serum PFAS levels in firefighters.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05869747; \nhttps://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05869747.\nINTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID): DERR1-10.2196/67120.\n\n©Reagan Conner, Cynthia Porter, Karen Lutrick, Shawn C Beitel, James Hollister, \nOlivia Healy, Krystal J Kern, Floris Wardenaar, John J Gulotta, Kepra Jack, \nMatthew Huentelman, Jefferey L Burgess, Melissa Furlong.

Non-coding RNAs such as HOX transcript antisense RNA \n(HOTAIR) and miR-3117 have been associated with cell proliferation, progression, \ninvasion, and metastasis, as well as poor survival in several cancer types. This \nstudy examines the potential association between the HOTAIR (rs920778 T>C) and \nmiR-3117 (rs7512692 C>T and rs4655646 G>A) variants and the clinicopathological \nfeatures of CRC in Mexican patients. The study included genomic DNA of \nperipheral blood samples from 557 individuals (296 CRC patients and 261 \ncontrols). The variants were identified by polymerase chain reaction-restriction \nfragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). The association was calculated using \nthe odds ratio (OR) test. P-values were adjusted using the Bonferroni test \n(0.016). Individuals carrying the T/C and C/C genotypes for the HOTAIR rs920778 \nvariant exhibited a higher susceptibility to CRC (OR=1.73, 95% CI: 1.15-2.58, \nP=0.009 and OR=2.78, 95% CI: 1.74-4.45, P=0.001, respectively). Male patients \nolder than 50 years and carrying the C/C genotype demonstrated an increased \nsusceptibility to developing CRC (OR=2.77, 95% CI: 1.63-4.70, P=0.001). \nAdditionally, C/C genotype carriers exhibited an association with the advanced \nTNM stage. Furthermore, for the rs7512692 variant of the miR-3117 gene, patients \ncarrying the C/T genotype exhibited increased susceptibility to developing CRC \n(OR=1.92, 95% CI: 1.35-2.74, P=0.001). Male patients over 50 years of age and \ncarrying the C/T genotype demonstrated increased susceptibility for early TNM \nstages and tumor location in the colon. The results obtained suggest that the \nHOTAIR rs920778 and miR-3117 rs7512692 variants play a significant role in \ncolorectal cancer risk.\n\nDOI: 10.14715/cmb/2025.71.3.4\nPMID: 40235333 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Accordingly, \nfurther research on related molecular mechanisms and pathology of LC is \nnecessary. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis and correlation analysis \nwere used to identify differentially expressed m6A-related ferroptosis genes in \nLC. The TCGA-HNSC and GSE65858 datasets were obtained from public databases. The \nTCGA-HNSC dataset consisted of 110 primary tumor oropharynx samples and 12 \ncontrol oropharynx samples, while the GSE65858 dataset contained forty-eight \nprimary tumor oropharynx samples. Univariate Cox and least absolute shrinkage \nand selection operator (LASSO) regression were utilized for feature selection \nand risk model construction in the TCGA-HNSC dataset. The risk model was \nvalidated in the GSE65858 dataset. Then, a nomogram was built based on the \nindependent prognostic factor identified using univariate and multivariate Cox \nregression in the TCGA-HNSC dataset. Mutation analysis, immune-related analysis, \nand drug sensitivity prediction were applied to analyze the utility of the risk \nmodel in the TCGA-HNSC dataset. Additionally, qRT-PCR and western blot were \nperformed to detect the TFRC, RGS4, and FTH1 expression. Three biomarkers were \nidentified to build a risk model using the univariate Cox and LASSO regression \nalgorithms. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis verified the \naccuracy of the risk model. Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) and \nEstimation of STromal and Immune cells in MAlignant Tumors using the Expression \ndata (ESTIMATE) algorithm showed a positive relationship between risk score and \nTIDE or ESTIMATE score. Furthermore, drug sensitivity prediction found that 19 \nchemotherapy drugs were strongly correlated with a risk score. TFRC, RGS4, and \nFTH1 exhibited high expression levels in 30 laryngeal carcinoma tissues and cell \nlines. Notably, TFRC and FTH1 expression levels were significantly associated \nwith patient prognosis.

Additionally, univariate and multivariate Cox analysis and ROC curve \nanalysis showed that low GZMM expression was related with poor overall survival \nand might be employed as a prognostic and diagnostic factor. We used functional \ntests to examine how GZMM affected angiogenesis, invasion, and migration in \nvitro. TIMER showed a link between GZMM expression, immune cell infiltration, \nand tumor purity. Overexpression of GZMM also greatly boosted CD8 + T \ncell-attracting chemokines. TCGA data analysis yielded a GZMM and epigenetic \nmodification-related gene risk prediction model. Overall, GZMM inhibits tumor \ninvasion, migration, and angiogenesis, and is closely related to the immune \nmicroenvironment, significantly associated with poor prognosis in THCA patients.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

To identify alcohol-responsive genes involved in \nesophageal carcinogenesis, we employed mouse models to systematically \ninvestigate alterations in cis-regulatory elements in the esophageal epithelium \nacross different ethanol exposure durations. A key exposure duration, 16 weeks \nof exposure to 20% ethanol, corresponded with increased expression of 222 genes \nthat correlated with ESCC progression and were enriched in pathways related to \nepithelial proliferation and oncogenesis. The construction of a comprehensive \ncis-regulatory element-gene map in human ESCC enables further evaluation of the \nrole of the alcohol-responsive genes in ESCC susceptibility, identifying \npromoter and enhancer variants. A three-stage case-control study involving 9,033 \nESCC cases and 10,801 controls revealed an enhancer variant, rs10223516, in \nFOXP4 that was associated with ESCC susceptibility through gene-alcohol \ninteraction. The rs10223516 variant modulated FOXP4 expression through a \nlong-range interaction, with the T allele exhibiting higher enhancer activity. \nAlcohol drinkers with the TT genotype exhibited a 76% higher risk of developing \nESCC than nondrinkers with the CC or TC genotype. Functional assays confirmed \nthat the variant enhanced FOXP4 transcriptional activity, and upregulated FOXP4 \npromoted ESCC development in vivo. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and \nRNA sequencing analyses further demonstrated that FOXP4 enhanced ESCC \nsusceptibility and tumor growth by transcriptionally activating CYP26B1 and MYC. \nThese findings highlight the complex gene-environment interactions between \nalcohol consumption and epigenetic alterations in esophageal tumorigenesis, \noffering potential targets for ESCC detection and prevention.\nSIGNIFICANCE: An enhancer variant in FOXP4 mediates the interplay between \nalcohol consumption, epigenetic alterations, and esophageal carcinogenesis, \nwhich could inform development of early detection and prevention strategies.\n\n©2025 American Association for Cancer Research.\n\nDOI: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-24-3839\nPMID: 40228145 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

However, the mechanisms by which miRNAs influence T cell \nfunction in tumor environments remain unclear. This study focuses on miR-379-5p, \nwhich counteracts T cell exhaustion and enhances antitumor responses.\nMETHODS: Native CD8+ T cells were isolated from the blood of healthy donors and \nsubjected to chronic stimulation to induce exhaustion. RNA sequencing and miRNA \nsequencing were performed to identify differentially expressed miRNAs. These \nmiRNAs underwent bioinformatics analyses, including DESeq enrichment, immune \ncell infiltration assessment, and patient prognostic outcomes in The Cancer \nGenome Atlas data sets to assess their potential involvement in T cell \nexhaustion and antitumor immunity. The biological functions of miRNA on T cell \ndifferentiation, cytotoxic killing, and immune checkpoint regulation were \ninvestigated using in vitro assays, OT-I B16F10-OVA models, and patient-derived \ntumor organoids.\nRESULTS: MiR-379-5p is downregulated in exhausted T cells and negatively \nassociated with exhausted tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in advanced tumors. It \ncorrelates positively with better survival outcomes in breast cancer, cervical \ncancer and melanoma. In CD8+ T cells, miR-379-5p reduces the expression of \nimmune checkpoint proteins T cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3 \n(TIM3) and T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT) by targeting \ntheir 3' untranslated region. Overexpression of miR-379-5p in CD8+ T cell \npromotes differentiation into memory-like T effector cells and enhances \ncytotoxic killing of cancer cells. The transcription factor nuclear receptor \nsubfamily 4 group A member 1 (NR4A1) with increased expression in exhausted T \ncells and negatively regulates miR-379, restoring immune checkpoint expression \nand suppressing cancer-killing ability. In contrast, OT-I T cells expressing \nectopic miR-379-5p show increased cytotoxicity against B16F10-OVA tumors in \nmice. Autologous T cells isolated from patients with breast cancer transduced \nwith miR-379-5p significantly improve killing of tumor organoids derived from \nthe same patients.\nCONCLUSIONS: MiR-379-5p acts as an epigenetic tumor suppressor by enhancing CD8+ \nT cell effector functions and suppressing T cell exhaustion. MiR-379-5p could \nrepresent a novel marker and strategy for cancer immunotherapy, offering \npromising avenues for enhancing antitumor immune responses.\n\n© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.

This investigation \naims to comprehensively assess the prognosis of PCa based on ERGs and explore \nits underlying biological mechanisms. Univariate, multivariate, and Least \nAbsolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression analyses were \nconducted to identify prognostic signature genes and build a prognostic model. \nThe model's predictive performance was assessed using Receiver Operating \nCharacteristic (ROC) curve analysis.

Additionally, miRNAs targeting the \nidentified signature genes were predicted using the miRNet database. This study \nidentified six ERGs as prognostic biomarkers for PCa: POU4F1, BMP2, PGF, GAS1, \nGNAZ, and FGF11. The findings indicated that individuals in the low-risk \ncategory exhibited improved prognostic results. Notably, PCa progression may be \nclosely linked to the cell adhesion molecule pathway and epigenetic regulation. \nAdditionally, hsa-let-7a-5p and hsa-miR-34a-5p were identified as potential \ntherapeutic regulators for PCa treatment.

The amplification of specific \nchromosomal regions is a hallmark of cancer progression; for instance, the 3q \nregion of chromosome 3 is notably amplified in lung cancer, contributing to \nearly tumor development. TP63, a member of the p53 family, is located in the 3q \nregion. The presence of two distinct sets of TP63 isoforms (ΔNp63 and TAp63) \ncomplicates its functional role. Furthermore, miR-205-5p, a crucial player in \ncancer progression, has a predicted target site in the 5'-untranslated region \n(5'-UTR) of TAp63 transcripts. To investigate a potential correlation between \nmiR-205-5p and the ΔNp63 and TAp63 isoforms, we conducted an in silico study \nfollowed by experimental validations on clinical tissue samples. We found a \nsignificant positive correlation between the expression of miR-205-5p and both \nisoforms of TP63 in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) datasets. The correlation between \nΔNp63 and miR-205-5p was further confirmed in tissue samples from LUAD patients. \nSubsequently, we overexpressed ΔNp63α in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines and \nobserved an upregulation of miR-205-5p, TAp63α, and DICER in the A549 cell line. \nOverexpression of ΔNp63α also inhibited the migration of A549 cells by reducing \nepithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers and increasing \nmesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) markers. We conducted a luciferase assay \nto investigate the direct interaction between miR-205-5p and the 5'-UTR of TAp63 \nand observed a positive association. Overexpression of miR-205-5p in the A549 \ncell line led to the upregulation of TAp63α and DICER. Additionally, we found a \nreduction in migration following miR-205-5p transfection. Based on these \nresults, it appears that there is a ΔNp63α/miR-205-5p/TAp63α/DICER axis involved \nin the regulation of migration in lung adenocarcinoma, which is cell-specific.\n\n© 2025.

This in silico study examines \nthe relationship between IBD and CAC, with particular regard to \ndifferentially-expressed genes (DEGs).\nMETHODS: Integrated bioinformatics tools and public databases were employed. \nData from GEO (GSE102133, GSE48958, GSE9348, GSE83687, GSE138202) were processed \nusing GEOexplorer. DEGs were then functionally annotated with DAVID, SRplot, and \nintegrated analysis via Metascape. Validation used Oncopression and Human \nProtein Atlas. Survival analysis employed GEPIA2. miRNA interactions were \nstudied via miRTargetLink 2.0. Immune infiltration was analyzed with TIMER 2.0. \nCOL1A1 expression and mutations were examined using cBioPortal, Kaplan-Meier \nplotter, and DNA methylation was analyzed using MethSurv. Correlation of COL1A1 \ngene promoter methylation with tissue type and clinical data was performed using \nthe UALCAN database. The ROC analysis of COL1A1 was conducted in the R \nenvironment.\nRESULTS: Our analysis identified three potential hub genes (ICAM1, LAMC1, and \nCOL1A1), which are overexpressed in IBD and cancer tissues compared to normal \ntissue, and hence may play a role in CAC. Furthermore, patients with lower \nCOL1A1 expression had longer disease-free survival (p = 0.01) than those with \nhigher expression. Therefore, this gene was chosen for further analysis and \nidentified as the most crucial.\nCONCLUSION: COL1A1 reveals significant immunohistochemistry, mutations, and \nmethylation data. Further studies involving machine learning and clinical data \nare required to validate the results.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Elsevier Ltd.

As a key component of tobacco \nsmoke, nicotine is believed to play a significant role in promoting NSCLC growth \nand progression. EZH2 is an epigenetic regulator highly expressed in the tumor \ntissues of smokers. However, whether and how nicotine regulates the expression \nof EZH2 and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Bioinformatics analysis \nand immunohistochemistry were used to compare the expression of EZH2 in NSCLC \nsamples between smokers and nonsmokers. Western blotting, real-time quantitative \nPCR, and immunofluorescence were employed to confirm the effects of nicotine on \nEZH2 expression. Cell Counting Kit-8 assays, colony formation assays, \n5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine staining, and Transwell assays were conducted to \nanalyze the proliferation and metastasis of A549 and H1650 cells treated with \nsiRNA or EZH2 inhibitors. Real-time quantitative PCR and chromatin \nimmunoprecipitation assays were performed to assess the regulatory effect of \nnicotine on EZH2 transcript levels via c-Myc. Coimmunoprecipitation and \nubiquitination assays were used to assess the deubiquitination of c-Myc by \nOTUB1. Finally, a nude mouse model was used to evaluate the impact of combined \nc-Myc and EZH2 inhibitors on tumor proliferation and metastasis in vivo. EZH2 is \nexpressed at relatively high levels in NSCLC patients, as determined by both \nbioinformatic and IHC analyses. Nicotine upregulates EZH2 expression and \npromotes the proliferation and metastatic ability of lung cancer cells. \nInhibition of EZH2 with either DZNep or EPZ6438, EZH2 inhibitors, or siRNA \nsignificantly decreased the proliferative and metastatic capacity of NSCLC cells \ninduced by nicotine treatment. Moreover, the study revealed that nicotine \ninduces OTUB1 expression, stabilizes the c-Myc protein via deubiquitination, and \nenables c-Myc-mediated transcriptional activation of EZH2. Furthermore, the \nc-Myc inhibitor 10058-F4 exhibited synergistic effects with the EZH2 inhibitor \nDZNep in suppressing NSCLC cell proliferation and metastasis both in vitro and \nin vivo.Nicotine regulates the c-Myc/EZH2 signaling pathway via OTUB1-mediated \ndeubiquitination, thereby promoting the proliferation and metastasis of NSCLC \ncells. This research reveals novel molecular mechanisms of nicotine in the \ndevelopment of NSCLC, providing a theoretical foundation for future therapeutic \nstrategies.\n\n© 2025.

However, \nthe interaction between genetic mutations and epigenetic regulation in cancer \ndevelopment has not been sufficiently examined. Here, we investigated the roles \nof gene mutations and altered circRNA expression in the malignant transformation \nof human bronchial epithelial cells after continuous exposure to CdCl2 (10 µM). \nThe circular RNA circ_0007095 was down-regulated, and the SETBP1-R54P single \nnucleotide variant (SNV) accumulated during Cd carcinogenesis. The decreased \ncirc_0007095 expression enhanced CdCl2-induced cancer cell proliferation, \nmigration and tumor formation, and the accumulation of SETBP1-R54P also promoted \nCdCl2-induced carcinogenesis. Mechanistic studies showed that SETBP1-R54P \nmutation promoted circ_0007095 degradation by activating the KLF4-PFKP axis in \nthe RNA degradation pathway.

A persistent \nlimitation of current risk stratification systems is that a subset of GISTs is \ngraded as low-risk but nevertheless metastasizes. Therefore, new predictive \nfactors that improve risk stratification are needed. In this exploratory study, \nwe investigated the potential of genome-wide DNA methylation profiling and copy \nnumber variation (CNV) analysis as additional prognostic tools for GISTs. We \ncollected a cohort of 28 patients with GIST diagnosed between 2001 and 2022, \nwith available follow-up and molecular data. This included 15 patients without \nprogressive disease (seven low-risk and eight moderate- to high-risk GISTs) and \n13 with progressive disease. Among those with progression, eight experienced \nrecurrence or metastasis post-surgery (one low-risk, seven high-risk GISTs), \nwhile five had metastatic disease at initial diagnosis. Risk stratification was \ndetermined according to Miettinen's criteria. Genome-wide DNA methylation data \nand CNV plots were generated from imatinib-naïve primary GISTs using the \nIllumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip array. Unsupervised cluster analysis \nrevealed distinct DNA methylation patterns predominantly associated with \nanatomical location and genotype. Differential DNA methylation analysis \ncomparing primary gastric GISTs associated with and without progressive disease \nshowed 8 differentially methylated regions spanning the coding and promoter \nareas of 6 genes. CNV analysis demonstrated that GISTs associated with \nprogressive disease had the most CNVs, whereas low-risk, non-progressive GISTs \nhad the fewest. Despite the limited sample size, this exploratory study \nindicates that genome-wide DNA methylation profiling and CNV analysis could \nenhance GIST risk stratification.\n\n© 2025 The Author(s).

Blood DNAm profiles have recently been used to predict \nplasma protein concentrations (\"Protein EpiScores\"), but their associations with \nbreast cancer risk have not been examined in detail.\nMETHODS: Whole blood DNAm profiles were obtained for a case-cohort sample of \nparticipants in the Sister Study and used to calculate 109 Protein EpiScores. Of \nthe 4,479 women included, 2,151 (48%) were diagnosed with breast cancer within \n15 years of their baseline blood draw (median time to diagnosis: 8.6 years; \n1,673 invasive cancer and 478 ductal carcinomas in situ). Protein EpiScores \nassociations with breast cancer incidence were estimated using weighted Cox \nregression models, overall and stratified by time and participant \ncharacteristics.\nRESULTS: Protein EpiScores for RARRES2, IGFBP4, and CCL21 were positively \nassociated with invasive breast cancer risk (hazard ratios from 1.17 to 1.24), \nwhile those for F7, SELL, CXCL9, CD48, and IL19 were inversely associated \n(hazard ratios from 0.82 to 0.86) (all FDR < 0.10). Eight immune \nresponse-related Protein EpiScores (CXCL9, CD48, FCGR3B, CXCL11, CCL21, CRTAM, \nVCAM1, GZMA) were associated with invasive cancers diagnosed within five years \nof enrollment. Protein EpiScore associations were consistently stronger for \nestrogen receptor-negative tumors.\nCONCLUSIONS: Several Protein EpiScores, including many related to immune \nresponse, were associated with breast cancer risk, highlighting novel changes to \nthe peripheral immune system that occur during breast cancer development.\n\n© 2025.

This \neffect is in part promoted by nutritional ketosis and could be involved in \ncounteracting obesity-related cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the \neffect of nutritional ketosis on the methylation of genes related to tumor \nprocesses in patients with obesity and in breast cancer cells. Based on \nmethylome data (Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip, Illumina) from patients with \nobesity treated with a VLCKD for weight loss (n = 10; n = 5 women, \nage = 48.8 ± 9.20 years, BMI = 32.9 ± 1.4 kg/m2), genes belonging to \ncancer-related pathways were specifically evaluated and further validated in \nvitro in MDA-MB-231 (triple negative) and MCF7 (RE positive) breast tumor cells \npretreated for 72 h with βOHB, the main ketone body, secretome from visceral \n(VATs) or subcutaneous (SATs) adipose tissue of patients with obesity. The cell \ntumoral phenotype was evaluated by proliferation assay and expression of \ncancer-related genes. VLCKD-induced nutritional ketosis promoted changes in the \nmethylation of 18 genes (20 CpGs; 17 hypomethylated, 3 hypermethylated) belonged \nto cancer-related pathways with MAPK10, CCN1, CTNNA2, LAMC3 and GLI2 being the \nmost representative genes. A similar pattern was observed in the MDA-MB-231 \ncells treated with β-OHB, without changes in MCF7. These epigenetic changes \nparalleled the tumoral phenotype modulated by the treatments. Taking together \nthese results highlight the potential role of VLCKD as an adjuvant to anticancer \ntreatment in groups more susceptible to the development of cancer such as \npatients with obesity, exerting epigenetic regulation through nutritional \nketosis and weight loss.\n\n© 2025.

Patients with BWS may \nexhibit hepatomegaly, as well as an increased risk of hepatoblastoma. To \nunderstand the impact of these 11p15 changes in the liver, we performed a \nmultiomic study [single nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) + single nucleus \nassay for transposable-accessible chromatin-sequencing (snATAC-seq)] of both \nBWS-liver and nonBWS-liver tumor-adjacent tissue. Our approach uncovers \nhepatocyte-specific enrichment of processes related to peroxisome \nproliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARA). To confirm our findings, we \ndifferentiated a BWS induced pluripotent stem cell model into hepatocytes. Our \ndata demonstrate the dysregulation of lipid metabolism in BWS-liver, which \ncoincides with observed upregulation of PPARA during hepatocyte differentiation. \nBWS hepatocytes also exhibit decreased neutral lipids and increased fatty acid \nβ-oxidation. We also observe increased reactive oxygen species byproducts in BWS \nhepatocytes, coinciding with increased oxidative DNA damage. This study proposes \na putative mechanism for overgrowth and cancer predisposition in BWS liver due \nto perturbed metabolism.\n\n© 2025.

Glyphosate, the \nactive ingredient in widely used agricultural herbicides, is recognized as a \npotential carcinogen and endocrine disruptor, making it a candidate for inducing \nepigenetic modifications linked to breast cancer. This study investigates the \neffects of the glyphosate-based herbicide Roundup® on non-tumorigenic (MCF10A) \nand tumorigenic (MCF7 and MDA-MB-231) breast cell lines, focusing on the \nexpression of key breast cancer-related genes. Additionally, the study examines \nthe association with epigenetic modifications and the use of epidrugs to reverse \npotential alterations, aiming to understand the risks and mechanisms of \nherbicide action. Results indicate that Roundup® affects cells through a \nnon-estrogenic mechanism, impacting both hormone-dependent and -independent \ncells with varying toxic and proliferative effects depending on dose and \nexposure time. Moreover, it altered the expression of breast cancer-related \ngenes such as BRCA1 and BRCA2 at low doses. The use of epigenetic modulators was \nable to reverse some Roundup®-induced changes, suggesting the herbicide's role \nin epigenetic modifications. Overall, these findings highlight the importance of \nunderstanding glyphosate-based herbicide mechanisms in humans, which could \nenable personalized prevention strategies to mitigate breast cancer risks.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Elsevier Ltd.

Conventional \nmethods, which depend on the subjective evaluation of histopathological \nfeatures, exhibit significant inter-observer variability and limited predictive \npower. To overcome these limitations, we developed cross-attention \ntransformer-based multimodal fusion network (CATfusion), a deep learning \nframework that integrates multimodal histology-genomic data for comprehensive \ncancer survival prediction. By employing self-supervised learning strategy with \nTabAE for feature extraction and utilizing cross-attention mechanisms to fuse \ndiverse data types, including mRNA-seq, miRNA-seq, copy number variation, DNA \nmethylation variation, mutation data, and histopathological images. By \nsuccessfully integrating this multi-tiered patient information, CATfusion has \nbecome an advanced survival prediction model to utilize the most diverse data \ntypes across various cancer types. CATfusion's architecture, which includes a \nbidirectional multimodal attention mechanism and self-attention block, is adept \nat synchronizing the learning and integration of representations from various \nmodalities. CATfusion achieves superior predictive performance over traditional \nand unimodal models, as demonstrated by enhanced C-index and survival area under \nthe curve scores. The model's high accuracy in stratifying patients into \ndistinct risk groups is a boon for personalized medicine, enabling tailored \ntreatment plans. Moreover, CATfusion's interpretability, enabled by \nattention-based visualization, offers insights into the biological underpinnings \nof cancer prognosis, underscoring its potential as a transformative tool in \noncology.\n\n© The Author(s) 2025.

Eleven patients expressing \nlatent/lytic EBV genes were considered positive. 5-mC% was determined using \nELISA technique and TSGs (PDLIM4, WIF1, DAPK1) promoters' methylation \npercentages were quantified by qMS-PCR. DNMTs (DNMT1 and DNMT3B) expression \nlevels were quantified in qRT-PCR.\nRESULTS: Overall, in laryngeal neoplastic samples vs peri-neoplastic ones, lower \n5mC% (p=0.004) and higher TSGs promoters hypermethylation were found (p<0.0001). \nSignificant correlation between PDLIM4 and DAPK1 promoter methylation and 5-mC% \n(PDLIM4 p=0.0186; DAPK1 p=0.0259) was noted. Higher 5-mC% (p=0.0041), lower \nPDLIM4 gene promoter methylation (p=0.0017) and overexpression of DNMTs (DNMT1: \np=0.0018, respectively DNMT3B: p=0.0017) were associated with EBV infection. \nAlso, significant differences between EBV-positive and EBV-negative cases based \non tumor stage (T) were noted for 5mC% in both T1/T2 (p=0.0364) and T3/T4 stages \n(p=0.0275), and for PDLIM4 promoter methylation in T1/T2 stages (p=0.0121).\nCONCLUSION: Future studies are needed to more effectively illustrate the \ninterplay between EBV infection and these epigenetic mechanisms. Notably, our \nstudy highlighted a correlation between EBV and epigenetic changes in laryngeal \ncarcinoma.\n\nPublisher: INTRODUCERE: Infecția cu EBV este un cunoscut factor de risc pentru \ncarcinogeneza laringiană și poate influența metilarea ADN, fiind un driver \nepigenetic în acest tip de malignitate.\nMETODE: Au fost incluse în studiu țesuturi laringiene pereche (neoplazice și \nperi-neoplazice) recoltate de la 24 pacienți. 11 pacienți la care s-a notat \nexpresia genelor EBV litice/latente au fost considerați pozitivi. 5-mC% a fost \ndeterminat prin tehnica ELISA, iar procentele de metilare a promotorilor genelor \ntumoral-supresoare (PDLIM4, WIF1, DAPK1) au fost cuantificate prin qMS-PCR. \nNivelurile de expresie ale DNMT1 și -3B au fost cuantificate prin qPCR.\nREZULTATE: Per total, în probele laringiene neoplazice vs. peri-neoplazice s-a \ncuantificat un procent mai scăzut de 5-mC (p=0,004) și o hipermetilare a \npromotorilor genelor investigate (p<0,0001) Au fost obținute corelații \nsemnificative între metilarea promotorilor genelor PDLIM4 și DAPK1 și 5-mC% \n(PDLIM4; p=0,0186; DAPK1; p=0,0259). Infecția cu EBV a fost asociată cu un \nprocent ridicat de 5-mC (p=0,0026), o hipometilare a promotorului PDLIM4 \n(p=0,0017) și hiperexpresia ADN metil-transferazelor (DNMT1; p=0,0018, respectiv \nDNMT3B; p=0,0017). Pe baza stadiului tumoral (T) au fost observate diferențe \nsemnificative între cazurile EBV-pozitive și EBV-negative atât pentru 5-mC% în \nstadiile T1/T2 (p=0,0364) și stadiile T3/T4 (p=0,0275), cât și pentru metilarea \npromotorului PDLIM4 în stadiile T1/T2 (p=0,0121).\nCONCLUZIE: Studii ulterioare vor ilustra mai bine interacțiunea dintre infecția \ncu EBV și acest mecanism epigenetic. Notabil, studiul nostru a evidențiat o \ncorelație între infecția cu acest virus și modificările epigenetice în \ncarcinomul laringian.\n\n© 2025 Irina Elisaveta Hotoboc et al., published by Sciendo.\n\nDOI: 10.2478/rjim-2025-0005\nPMID: 40116629 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Preclinical assays suggest that BETi \npotentially attenuates the PD1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint axis, supporting its \ncombination with immunomodulatory agents.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: A Phase 1b clinical trial was conducted to elucidate the \npharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of the BET inhibitor RO6870810 as \nmonotherapy and in combination with the PD-L1 antagonist atezolizumab in \npatients with advanced ovarian carcinomas and triple-negative breast cancer \n(TNBC). Endpoints included maximum tolerated dosages, adverse event profiling, \npharmacokinetic evaluations, and antitumor activity. Pharmacodynamic and \nimmunomodulatory effects were assessed in tumor tissue (by immunohistochemistry \nand RNA-seq) and in peripheral blood (by flow cytometry and cytokine analysis).\nRESULTS: The study was terminated prematurely due to a pronounced incidence of \nimmune-related adverse effects in patients receiving combination of RO6870810 \nand atezolizumab. Antitumor activity was limited to 2 patients (5.6%) showing \npartial response. Although target engagement was confirmed by established BETi \npharmacodynamic markers in both blood and tumor samples, BETi failed to markedly \ndecrease tumor PD-L1 expression and had a suppressive effect on antitumor \nimmunity. Immune effector activation in tumor tissue was solely observed with \nthe atezolizumab combination, aligning with this checkpoint inhibitor's \nrecognized biological effects.\nCONCLUSIONS: The combination of BET inhibitor RO6870810 with the checkpoint \ninhibitor atezolizumab presents an unfavorable risk-benefit profile for ovarian \ncancer and TNBC (triple-negative breast cancer) patients due to the increased \nrisk of augmented or exaggerated immune reactions, without evidence for \nsynergistic antitumor effects.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT03292172; Registration Date: \n2017-09-25.\n\n© 2025.

T-cell leukemia \ntranslocation-associated gene (TCTA) has emerged as a potential player in \nhematological malignancies, yet its role in AML remains unexplored.ObjectiveTo \ninvestigate the prognostic significance of TCTA in AML and elucidate its \nfunctional mechanisms.MethodsRNA sequencing data from 173 AML patients (TCGA) \nand 70 normal controls (GTEx) were analyzed. Patients were categorized into high \nand low TCTA expression groups. Bioinformatics tools assessed Gene Ontology, \nKEGG pathways, and immune infiltration and constructed a nomogram predicting \n1-5-year overall survival (OS).ResultsHigh TCTA expression correlated with \nsignificantly reduced OS (P < 0.001), with multivariate analysis identifying \nTCTA expression alongside age and cytogenetic risk as independent OS predictors. \nReceiver operating characteristic analysis validated TCTA's diagnostic \npotential. Enrichment analyses implicated TCTA in pathways critical to AML, such \nas hematopoiesis, p53 signaling, and DNA methylation, with a notable association \nwith natural killer (NK) cell activity.ConclusionsElevated TCTA expression \nsignifies poor prognosis in AML, positioning it as a promising prognostic \nbiomarker.

We examined all-cause, cardiovascular, and \ncancer mortality prediction by epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) estimated using \ndifferent epigenetic clocks. Among 2105 participants to the 1999-2002 National \nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey aged ≥ 50 years old and followed for \nmortality through 2019, we calculated EAAs from the residuals of nine epigenetic \nclocks regressed on chronological age. We assessed the association of EAAs and \npace of aging with mortality adjusting for covariates. During 17.5 years of \nmedian follow-up, 998 deaths occurred, including 272 from cardiovascular disease \nand 209 from cancer. Overall mortality was most significantly predicted by Grim \nEAA (P < 0.0001) followed by Hannum (P = 0.005), Pheno (P = 0.004), Horvath \n(P = 0.03), and Vidal-Bralo (P = 0.04) EAAs. Grim EAA predicted cardiovascular \nmortality (P < 0.0001), whereas Hannum (P = 0.006), Horvath (P = 0.009), and \nGrim (P = 0.01) EAAs predicted cancer mortality. Overall mortality prediction \ndiffered by race/ethnicity between non-Hispanic White and White participants for \nHorvath (Pinteraction = 0.048), Hannum (Pinteraction = 0.01), and Grim \n(Pinteraction = 0.04) EAAs. Hannum prediction of cancer mortality also differed \nbetween the two races/ethnicities (Pinteraction = 0.007). Despite being \npredictive in non-Hispanic White participants, Horvath (P = 0.75), Hannum \n(P = 0.84), and Grim (P = 0.10) EAAs failed to predict overall mortality in \nHispanic participants, and Hannum EAA was not associated with cancer mortality \nin Hispanic participants (P = 0.18). In a US representative sample, Horvath, \nHannum, SkinBlood, Pheno, Vidal-Bralo, and Grim EAAs as well as pace of aging \npredict mortality.

Ascertainment, assessment and testing of LS individuals is complex. \nA Canadian national guideline is needed to ensure equitable access to patient \ncare across the country.\nMETHODS: The Canadian Lynch Syndrome (CDN-LS) working group was formed in 2021, \nconsisting of 37 multidisciplinary LS experts and patient partners. To formulate \nconsensus statements, a national environmental scan, Canadian clinical survey \nand literature review were undertaken. The e-Delphi method was used to reach \nconsensus statements among the CDN-LS group.\nRESULTS: The CDN-LS group voted on 21 statements, and 18 statements were adopted \nwith over 80% agreement, including 16 statements that had over 90% agreement. \nThese statements provide comprehensive guidelines on universal MMR reflex \ntesting, cascade tumour testing (MLH1 promoter methylation, BRAF, somatic MMR), \ngermline testing, therapeutics and patient advocacy.\nCONCLUSION: This is the first comprehensive Canadian guideline for LS providing \nguidance to genetic specialists, laboratories, primary care providers and \nhealthcare providers caring for patients with LS. It is endorsed by the Canadian \nCollege of Medical Genetics and the Canadian Association of Genetic Counsellors. \nThe consensus statements are presented as a model for standard of care that \nimproves equitable access to health services for LS across the country.

Chronic microbial infection, particularly \nSalmonella, has been implicated in GB carcinogenesis, but its causative role and \nthe underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. We studied gut and gallbladder \ntissue microbiome through targeted metagenomics to identify pathogenic bacteria \nin GBC. Virulence and pathogenicity of identified Salmonella Typhimurium from \nGBC tissue were studied after culture by whole genome sequencing, phylogenetic \nanalysis, mutational profiling, and pangenome analysis. Mechanistic studies for \nGBC carcinogenesis were carried out in a mouse model of gallstones and chronic \nSalmonella infection, a cellular model using GBC (NOZ) cell lines, and a \nxenograft tumor model. We found an increased abundance of Salmonella in the gut \nmicrobiome of patients with GBC and culturable S. Typhimurium from the \ngallbladder cancer tissue. Comparative genomics of S. Typhimurium isolated from \nthe GBC tissue showed a high invasive index. S. Typhimurium isolates harbored \nhorizontally acquired virulence functions in their accessory genome. Chronic S. \nTyphimurium infection caused chronic inflammation, pre-malignant changes, and \ntumor-promoting mechanisms in the mouse model with gallbladder stones with \nactivation of the epigenetic modulator KDM6B both in the mouse model and human \nGBC. Inhibition of KDM6B reduced engrafted tumor size in SCID mice. Of the \ndifferentially regulated genes in human GBC tissue, ADAMTSL5, CX3CR1, and SPSB4 \nwere also significantly dysregulated in NOZ cells infected with Salmonella. \nChronic Salmonella infection contributes to gallbladder carcinogenesis through a \nhost epigenetic mechanism involving KDM6B.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

Germline biallelic inactivation of the ATM \ngene causes ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), and heterozygous pathogenic variant \n(PV) carriers are at increased risk of cancer, notably breast cancer. This study \naimed to investigate whether DNA methylation profiling can be useful as a \nbiomarker to identify tumors arising in ATM PV carriers, which may help for the \nmanagement and optimal tailoring of therapies of these patients.\nMETHODS: Breast tumor enriched DNA was prepared from 2 A-T patients, 27 patients \ncarrying an ATM PV, 6 patients carrying a variant of uncertain clinical \nsignificance and 484 noncarriers enrolled in epidemiological studies conducted \nin France and Australia to investigate genetic and nongenetic factors involved \nin breast cancer susceptibility. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis was \nperformed using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation EPIC and 450K BeadChips. \nCorrelation between promoter methylation and gene expression was assessed for 10 \ntumors for which transcriptomic data were available.\nRESULTS: We found that the ATM promoter was hypermethylated in 62% of tumors of \nheterozygous PV carriers compared to the mean methylation level of ATM promoter \nin tumors of noncarriers. Gene set enrichment analyses identified 47 biological \npathways enriched in hypermethylated genes involved in neoplastic, \nneurodegenerative and metabolic-related pathways in tumor of PV carriers. Among \nthe 327 differentially methylated promoters, promoters of ARHGAP40, SCGB3A1 \n(HIN-1), and CYBRD1 (DCYTB) were hypermethylated and associated with a lower \ngene expression in these tumors. Moreover, using three different deep learning \nalgorithms (logistic regression, random forest and XGBoost), we identified a set \nof 27 additional biomarkers predictive of ATM status, which could be used in the \nfuture to provide evidence for or against pathogenicity in ATM variant \nclassification strategies.\nCONCLUSIONS: We showed that breast tumors that arise in women who carry an ATM \nPV display a specific genome-wide DNA methylation profile. Specifically, the \nmethylation pattern of 27 key gene promoters was predictive of ATM PV status of \nthe women. These genes may also represent new medical prevention and therapeutic \ntargets for these women.\n\n© 2025.

Smokeless tobacco (SLT) \nproducts are commonly consumed in South Asian countries, where their use \nfrequently co-occurs with exposure to arsenic from contaminated groundwater. To \ndecipher the in vitro molecular and cellular responses to arsenic and/or \nsmokeless tobacco, we performed temporal multi-omics analysis of the \ntranscriptome and DNA methylome remodeling in exposed hTERT-immortalized human \nnormal oral keratinocytes (NOK), as well as arsenic and/or smokeless tobacco \ngenotoxicity and mutagenicity investigations in NOK cells and in human p53 \nknock-in murine embryonic fibroblasts (Hupki MEF). RNAseq results from acute \nexposures of NOK cell to arsenic alone and in combination with smokeless tobacco \nextract revealed upregulation of genes with roles in cell cycle changes, \napoptosis and inflammatory responses. This was in keeping with global DNA \nhypomethylation affecting genes involved in the same processes after chronic \ntreatment. At the phenotypic level, we observed a dose-dependent decrease in NOK \ncell viability, induction of DNA damage, cell cycle changes and increased \napoptosis, with the most pronounced effects observed under arsenic and SLT \nco-exposure conditions. Live-cell imaging experiments indicated that the DNA \ndamage likely resulted from induction of apoptosis, an observation validated by \na lack of exome-wide mutagenesis in response to chronic exposure to arsenic \nand/or smokeless tobacco. In sum, our integrative omics study provides novel \ninsights into the acute and chronic responses to arsenic and smokeless tobacco \n(co-)exposure, with both types of responses converging on several key mechanisms \nassociated with cancer hallmark processes. The resulting rich catalogue of \nmolecular programs in oral cells regulated by arsenic and smokeless tobacco \n(co-)exposure may provide bases for future development of biomarkers for use in \nmolecular cancer epidemiology studies of exposed populations at risk.\n\n© 2025 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.\n\nDOI: 10.1002/biof.70011\nPMCID: PMC11962598\nPMID: 40056068 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: DECLARATION OF COMPETING INTEREST The authors \ndeclare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal \nrelationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this \npaper."

Colorectal carcinogenesis is \ncomplicated, and the processes are triggered by the complex interaction of some \ngenetic and environmental factors, including DNA methylation. Previous studies \nshowed that RALYL is hypermethylated in CRC. We aimed to explore the role of \nRALYL in CRC involved in MNK2 alternative splicing in the present study.\nMETHODS: Bioinformatics analysis, detection in CRC samples, and experiments \nin vitro and in vivo combined with gene knockdown and overexpression were \nconducted. Cell proliferation and tumor growth assays were performed.\nRESULTS: Results showed that hypermethylated RALYL is lowly expressed in CRC. \nOverexpression of RALYL suppresses cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth \nin vivo in CRC. MNK2 alternative splicing is essential for the tumor suppressive \nrole of RALYL, along with RALYL regulating MNK2 alternative splicing via HNRNPC \nin CRC.\nCONCLUSIONS: RALYL potentially exerts an inhibitory effect on CRC by engaging \nwith HNRNPC to orchestrate the alternative splicing of MNK2. RALYL binds to \nHNRNPC to promote MNK2 splicing into MNK2a instead of MNK2b, consequently \nactivating the p38 MAPK signaling pathway and inhibiting tumor proliferation in \nCRC. Our findings suggest that RALYL might suppress CRC through binding to \nHNRNPC to promote MNK2 splicing toward MNK2a, thereby activating the p38 MAPK \nsignaling cascade.\n\n© 2025 The Author(s).

Given high survival rates, addressing long-term side \neffects of RT is crucial for preserving quality-of-life. Radiogenomics, the \nstudy of genetic variations affecting response to radiation, has primarily \nfocussed on genomic biomarkers, while DNA methylation studies offer insights \ninto RT responses. Although most research has centred on tumours, no \nepigenome-wide association studies have explored peripheral blood biomarkers of \nRT-induced toxicities in prostate cancer patients. Identifying such biomarkers \ncould reveal molecular mechanisms underlying RT response and enable personalized \ntreatment.\nMETHODS: We analysed 105 prostate cancer patients (52 cases and 53 controls). \nCases developed grade ≥ 2 genitourinary and/or gastrointestinal late toxicity \nafter 12 months of starting RT, whereas controls did not. An epigenome-wide \nassociation study of post-RT toxicities was performed using the Illumina \nMethylationEPIC BeadChip, adjusting for age and cell type composition. We \nconstructed two methylation risk scores-one using differentially methylated \npositions (MRSsites) and another using differentially methylated regions \n(MRSregions)-as well as a Support Vector Machine-based methylation signature \n(SVMsites). We evaluated RT effects on biological age and stochastic epigenetic \nmutations within established radiation response pathways. Gene Ontology and \npathway enrichment analyses were also performed.\nRESULTS: Pre-RT methylation analysis identified 56 differentially methylated \npositions (adjusted p-value ≤ 0.05), and 6 differentially methylated regions \n(p-value ≤ 0.05) associated with the genes NTM, ACAP1, IL1RL2, VOOP1, AKR1E2, \nand an intergenic region on chromosome 13 related to Short/Long Interspersed \nNuclear Elements. Both Methylation Risk Scores (MRSsites AUC = 0.87; MRSregions \nAUC = 0.89) and the 8-CpG Support Vector Machine signature (SVMsites AUC = 0.98) \nexhibited strong discriminatory accuracy in classifying patients in the \ndiscovery cohort. Gene ontology analysis revealed significant enrichment \n(adjusted p-value ≤ 0.05) of genes involved in DNA repair, inflammatory \nresponse, tissue repair, and oxidative stress response pathways.\nCONCLUSIONS: Epigenetic biomarkers show potential for predicting severe \nlong-term adverse effects of RT in prostate cancer patients. The identified \nmethylation patterns provide valuable insights into toxicity mechanisms and may \naid personalized treatment strategies. However, validation in independent \ncohorts is essential to confirm their predictive value and clinical \napplicability.\n\n© 2025.

Thus, tobacco use is a major modifiable \nrisk factor for HNSCC, even in the era of human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated \ndisease. However, how smoking underlies chromosomal and epigenetic changes that \nare associated with HNSCC outcomes remains unclear.\nOBJECTIVE: To characterize genetic and molecular differences and associated \nbiological pathways in patients with HNSCC based on smoking history.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study included \npatients with a confirmed diagnosis of HNSCC from the Cancer Genome Atlas via \ncBioPortal data independent of HPV status. Data were analyzed between April 2023 \nand May 2024.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Smoking history was defined as individuals who \nsmoked (currently or previously) compared with nonsmokers (never smoked). \nGenetic and molecular differences of interest were single nucleotide variation, \ncopy number alteration, DNA methylation, and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression. \nAccounting for multiple testing, we reported the false discovery rate (FDR), \nwith a statistically significant FDR of 0.05 or less. Potential functions and \npathways were investigated using the Panther classification system, and the \nFisher exact test was used for overrepresentation, using the Reactome pathway \ndataset as a guide. Associations between smoking-related genetic alterations and \noverall survival were analyzed using log-rank tests.\nRESULTS: Of 511 participants, 135 (26.4%) were female, and the mean (SD) age was \n60.8 (11.9) years. People who smoked (389 [76.1%]) demonstrated significantly \nenriched copy number alterations on 9 genes located on chromosome 11q13 compared \nwith nonsmokers (122 [23.9%]; FDR, 0.044-0.046). Two genes, FADD and CTTN, were \nsignificantly highly methylated in nonsmokers. Also, PPFIA1, FGF19, CCND1 and \nLTO1 were highly expressed in mRNA in those who smoked, while FADD mRNA \nexpression was negatively correlated with FADD DNA methylation in nonsmokers \n(Pearson r = -0.53; 95% CI, -0.59 to -0.49) and those who smoked (Pearson \nr = -0.57; 95% CI, -0.63 to -0.51). People who smoked with altered FADD had \nhigher risk of dying than those with FADD unaltered (hazard ratio, 1.40; 95% CI, \n1.004-1.96). Pathway analysis showed the significant genes were collectively \nassociated with cellular processes and biological regulations, including \nolfactory signaling and the PI3K/AKT network.\nCONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: The results of this cohort study suggest that there \nmay be patterned genetic and molecular differences in patients with HNSCC based \non smoking history, especially genes located on chromosome 11q13. These genomic \ndifferences due to smoking make smoking a modifiable risk factor for HNSCC \noutcomes.\n\nDOI: 10.1001/jamaoto.2024.5409\nPMCID: PMC11886874\nPMID: 40048195 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: Conflict of Interest Disclosures: Dr Jiang \nreported grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) during the conduct \nof the study.

Our \nprimary objective was to investigate DNA methylation dynamics during DTC \nprogression, with a secondary goal of assessing potential clinical implications. \nMaterials and Methods: We conducted a multicenter retrospective study in \npatients with DTC who underwent surgery at five university hospitals. We \nprofiled DNA methylation in a discovery series of 97 samples (15 normal tissues, \n30 non-metastatic [non-mDTC], and 35 metastatic [mDTC] primary DTC, and 17 \npaired metastases [lymph nodes and DM]). Results were validated in an \nindependent series of 17 non-mDTC and 13 mDTC. We used receiver operating \ncharacteristic curve analysis to evaluate the identified prognostic \nCpG-signature. Results: DNA methylation alterations, mostly hypomethylation, \nincreased progressively from primary tumors to DM, both in papillary (PTC) and \nfollicular (FTC) thyroid carcinomas. Compared with normal tissue, non-metastatic \nprimary PTC (non-mPTC) exhibited more hypomethylated than hypermethylated CpGs \nin contrast to non-metastatic primary FTC (non-mFTC). However, metastatic \ntumors, both mPTC and mFTC, predominantly exhibited hypomethylated CpGs. The \noverlap of differentially methylated CpGs (DMe-CpGs) was low between non-mPTC \nand non-mFTC (14% non-mPTC DMe-CpGs present in non-mFTC) but significantly \nhigher between mPTC and mFTC (60% mPTC DMe-CpGs present in mFTC), underscoring \nthe convergence of epigenetic changes during metastatic progression. The \npresence of many de novo DMe-CpGs from metastatic primary tumors (83% from mPTC \nand 40% from mFTC) in DM, including metachronous DM, supports the hypothesis \nthat DM originates from a major subclone of the primary tumor. We identified and \nvalidated a 156-CpG signature in primary tumors capable of distinguishing \nbetween non-mDTC and mDTC, offering potential prognostic value for DM \ndevelopment regardless of histology. Conclusions: These results show a \nprogressive increase in DNA methylation alterations, mainly hypomethylation, \nduring PTC and FTC metastatic progression, suggesting a linear model, though the \nDNA methylation dynamics differs between the two histological types. The \nanalysis of the 156-CpG signature in primary tumors may help identify patients \nwith DTC at high risk for DM, enhancing a more personalized treatment.\n\nDOI: 10.1089/thy.2024.0303\nPMID: 40045915 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

In \nthis study, we investigate genomic, transcriptomic, and clinical features of \nERpHER2n-HER2E breast tumors using two primary ERpHER2n cohorts comprising a \ntotal of 5640 patients. We show that ERpHER2n-HER2E tumors exhibit aggressive \nclinical features and poorer clinical outcomes compared to Luminal A and Luminal \nB tumors. Furthermore, ERpHER2n-HER2E breast cancer does not consist of \nmisclassified or HER2-low cases, has little impact of ERBB2, is highly \nproliferative and less ER dependent than other luminal subtypes. It is not an \nobvious biological entity but is nevertheless associated with potentially \ntargetable molecular features, notably a high immune response and high FGFR4 \nexpression. Strikingly, molecular features that define the HER2E subtype in \nluminal disease are also consistent in HER2-positive disease, including an \nepigenetic mechanism for high FGFR4 expression in breast cancer.\n\n© 2025.

This study aimed to assay the expression and methylation profile of \nGCNT2 in AML, and further elucidate the clinical significance.\nMETHODS: Multiple datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer \nGenome Atlas projects (TCGA) were used to explore the expression and methylation \nprofile of GCNT2 in normal hematopoiesis and AML. A pan-cancer analysis was \nperformed to define the survival implications of GCNT2 across multiple cancers \nincluding AML. The relationships between GCNT2 expression/methylation and \nclinicopathologic features were investigated using a TCGA-AML dataset. \nCorrelation analysis was performed to explore the relationship between \ntranscriptional expression and DNA methylation. Differentially expressed genes \n(DEGs) on the KEGG pathway and GO terms were visualized using DAVID. Gene Set \nEnrichment Analysis (GESA) was carried out to assess the underlying mechanism. \nThe relationship between methylation and immune cell infiltration was also \nexamined.\nRESULTS: GCNT2 expression was highest in hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) but \ngradually decreased during the hematopoiesis differentiation, the monocytes, \nhowever, remained a high level of GCNT2 as an exception. In AML, GCNT2 was \ndown-regulated as compared to normal hematopoiesis but was much higher in \ncontrast to normal peripheral blood samples. Data from a pan-cancer analysis \nrevealed that high-expressed GCNT2 contributed to a worse OS for AML. DNA \nmethylation of GCNT2 showed a distinctive co-methylation pattern in AML and \nsignificantly negatively correlated with transcriptional expression. Methylation \nin the transcriptional start site of isoform A plays a critical role in the \nepigenetic regulation of GCNT2 expression. The silence of GCNT2 in AML was \nattributed to DNA methylation. Hypomethylation of isoform A significantly \npredicted poor survival in AML, linking to several cytogenetic and molecular \nabnormalities, such as t (8:21), inv (16), t (15;17), and genes mutations of \nDNMT3A, CEBPA, RUNX1, and WT1. Enrichment analysis disclosed that \nhypomethylation of isoform A was involved in the immune system, and it was \nfurther revealed that hypomethylation of isoform A was tightly associated with \nimmune cell infiltration and could be served as a promising indicator for \nimmunotherapy.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our comprehensive research demonstrated that GCNT2 acted as an \noncogene in AML, and was epigenetically regulated by DNA methylation in isoform \nA. Hypomethylation of isoform A could be served as a promising indicator to \nidentify the high-risk AML patients who might be responsive to immunotherapy.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Wu, Qiu, Xu, Lin and Qian.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2025.1490330\nPMCID: PMC11873079\nPMID: 40034691 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest."

However, effective common drugs for treating PC and/or \nKC patients who are also suffering from T2D are currently lacking, despite the \nprobability of their co-occurrence. Taking disease-specific multiple drugs \nduring the co-existence of multiple diseases may lead to adverse side effects or \ntoxicity to the patients due to drug-drug interactions. This study aimed to \nidentify T2D-, PC and KC-causing common genomic biomarkers (cGBs) highlighting \ntheir pathogenetic mechanisms to explore effective drugs as their common \ntreatment. We analyzed transcriptomic profile datasets, applying weighted gene \nco-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and protein-protein interaction (PPI) \nnetwork analysis approaches to identify T2D-, PC-, and KC-causing cGBs. We then \ndisclosed common pathogenetic mechanisms through gene ontology (GO) terms, KEGG \npathways, regulatory networks, and DNA methylation of these cGBs. Initially, we \nidentified 78 common differentially expressed genes (cDEGs) that could \ndistinguish T2D, PC, and KC samples from controls based on their transcriptomic \nprofiles. From these, six top-ranked cDEGs (TOP2A, BIRC5, RRM2, ALB, MUC1, and \nE2F7) were selected as cGBs and considered targets for exploring common drug \nmolecules for each of three diseases. Functional enrichment analyses, including \nGO terms, KEGG pathways, and regulatory network analyses involving transcription \nfactors (TFs) and microRNAs, along with DNA methylation and immune infiltration \nstudies, revealed critical common molecular mechanisms linked to PC, KC, and \nT2D. Finally, we identified six top-ranked drug molecules (NVP.BHG712, \nIrinotecan, Olaparib, Imatinib, RG-4733, and Linsitinib) as potential common \ntreatments for PC, KC and T2D during their co-existence, supported by the \nliterature reviews. Thus, this bioinformatics study provides valuable insights \nand resources for developing a genome-guided common treatment strategy for PC \nand/or KC patients who are also suffering from T2D.\n\n© 2025.

Increasing evidence suggests that environmental and \nlifestyle factors can influence epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, \nhistone acetylation, and microRNA expression.

Gene annotation was conducted using \ng-Profiler by screening for single nucleotide polymorphisms significantly \nassociated with outcome, followed by analysis of the gene interaction network \nusing GeneMANIA, and visualization using igraph. In conclusion, this study \ndemonstrates that air pollution has a significant impact on cancer incidence, \nprovides strong evidence for an epigenetic causal link between the two, and \nprovides new insights into the molecular mechanisms by which air pollution \naffects cancer development.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

GynTect® is a six-methylation-marker assay that has \ndemonstrated its potential as a triage tool for cervical lesion detection and \nprediction. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of GynTect® \nin predicting the histology outcomes of post-LEEP specimens.\nMETHOD: A retrospective analysis was conducted to evaluate the clinical \nprofiles, GynTect® results, and histology outcomes of postoperative specimens \nfrom 78 patients diagnosed with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion \n(HSIL) who underwent LEEP. The GynTect® assay is a six-marker (ASTN1, DLX1, \nITGA4, RXFP3, SOX17, and ZNF671) methylation detection assay for cervical prep \ncell samples. Preoperative cervical cytology, high-risk human papillomavirus \n(hrHPV) detection, and methylation analysis were obtained from each participant. \nPreoperative colposcopic impression and biopsy results were recorded. \nStatistical analysis and multivariate logistic regression were performed using \nIBM SPSS Statistics 25.\nRESULTS: Among the negative-GynTect® patients, 19 cases (57.6%) showed histology \ndowngrading post-LEEP, while 14 cases (42.4%) showed sustained or upgrading \nhistology results. In the positive-GynTect® patients, 8 cases (17.8%) showed \ndowngrading histology results post-LEEP and 37 cases (82.2%) showed sustained or \nupgrading histology. The difference was statistically significant (p = 0.001). \nMultivariate regression analysis identified positive GynTect® outcomes and \ncolposcopic impressions indicating HSIL on the day of surgery as independent \npredictors of pathological sustained or upgrading after LEEP.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study underscores the potential of GynTect® in predicting \nhistology outcomes of post-LEEP specimens, thereby showcasing its promising \nability to assist clinicians in selecting appropriate therapeutic regimens for \npatients with HSIL.\n\n© 2025.

However, the mechanisms by which these \ngermline variants influence cancer progression, particularly through gene \nexpression and proteostasis control, remain unclear. By analyzing genomic data \nfrom a gastric cancer (GC) case-control study (2,117 individuals), focusing on \nthe ubiquitin-specific protease (USP) family, we identify the SNP rs72856331 \n(G>A) in the promoter region of the proto-oncogene USP47 as a putative \nsusceptibility allele for GC. Mechanistically, the risk allele G is associated \nwith enhanced USP47 expression, mediated by altered recruitment of the \ntranscription factor GLI3 and changes in the epigenetic status at promoter. \nCRISPR/Cas9-mediated single-nucleotide conversion into risk allele G results in \nincreased GLI3 binding and subsequent USP47 upregulation. The depletion of GLI3 \nresults in a reduction of cancer-related phenotypes, similar to those observed \nfollowing USP47 knockdown. Furthermore, we identify Snai1 as a deubiquitination \ntarget of USP47, explaining USP47-dependent activation of the \nepithelial-mesenchymal transition pathway and tumor progression. Our findings \nidentify an important genetic predisposition that implicates the perturbation of \ntranscription and proteostasis programs in GC, offering insights into prevention \nand therapeutic strategies for genetically stratified patients.\n\nDOI: 10.1172/JCI179617\nPMCID: PMC11996917\nPMID: 39998882 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

In addition, methylation levels of HIN-1 and RASSF1A promoters were \nelevated in ER-positive compared to ER-negative BCa (p-value<0.04). ANOVA Mixed \nModel revealed significantly higher methylation levels in the promoter of \nRASSF1A for fibroadenoma and ER-positive BCa (p=0.004) compared to ER-negative \nBCa. Tumors with unclassified molecular subtypes (ER-positive, PR-negative, \nHER2-negative) had elevated levels of methylation (p=0.046) in the P0 promoter \ncompared with luminal B (ER-positive, PR-positive, HER2-positive) tumors. Grade \n3 tumors showed a borderline association with ESRα P1 promoter methylation when \ncompared with grade 2 tumors (p=0.056).\nCONCLUSION: ESRα P0 promoter hypermethylation may occur in the early stages of \nbreast carcinogenesis, while P1 promoter methylation appears in later stages \nwith a poor prognosis. Therefore, methylation of the ESRα promoter and other \ntumor-related genes could serve as a potential biomarker for predicting \nfibroadenoma progression risk to BCa.\n\nCopyright © 2025, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J. \nDelinasios), All rights reserved.\n\nDOI: 10.21873/cgp.20497\nPMCID: PMC11880923\nPMID: 39993808 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The Authors declare that they have no known \ncompeting financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared \nto influence the work reported in this paper."

Our objective was to predict the susceptibility \nto prostate neoplasia, focused on benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and \nprostate cancer (PCa), based on the pharmacoepigenetic and the metabolic profile \nof Caucasians.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Two independent cohorts of 47,389 individuals in total \nwere assessed to find risk associations of CYP450 genes with prostatic \nneoplasia. The metabolic profile of the first cohort was statistically evaluated \nand frequencies of absorption-distribution-metabolism-excretion-toxicity (ADMET) \nproperties were calculated. Prediction of miRNA pharmacoepigenetic targeting was \nperformed.\nRESULTS: We found that prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia patients \nof the first cohort shared common cardiometabolic trends. Drug classes C08CA, \nC09AA, C09CA, C10AA, C10AX of the cardiovascular, and G04CA, G04CB of the \ngenitourinary systems, were associated with increased prostate cancer risk, \nwhile C03CA and N06AB of the cardiovascular and nervous systems were associated \nwith low-risk for PCa. CYP3A4*1B was the most related pharmacogenetic \npolymorphism associated with prostate cancer susceptibility. miRNA-200c-3p and \nmiRNA-27b-3p seem to be associated with CYP3A4 targeting and prostate cancer \npredisposition. Metabolomic analysis indicated that 11β-OHT, 2β-OHT, 15β-OHT, \n2α-OHT and 6β-OHT had a high risk, and 16α-OHT, and 16β-OHT had an intermediate \ndisease-risk.\nCONCLUSION: These findings constitute a novel integrated signature for prostate \ncancer susceptibility.

Noncancerous breast tissue was collected from women who underwent \nreduction mammoplasty or breast cancer surgery. Statistical analyses were \nconducted between May and August 2024.\nEXPOSURES: Two socioenvironmental exposures were examined: air pollution \n(specifically, fine particulate matter less than 2.5 μm in diameter [PM2.5]) and \nneighborhood deprivation (measured with Neighborhood Deprivation Index [NDI]). \nParticipant geocodes were linked to 2000 US Census data to calculate PM2.5 \nconcentrations (total mass [μg/m3]) and NDI.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Breast tissues underwent immunohistochemical \nstaining for pan-macrophage marker CD68 to detect 2 outcomes: CLS-B and \nadipose-associated macrophages. CLS-B and adipose-related macrophages were \nassessed by pathologists using artificial intelligence-assisted and manual \napproaches. Covariate-adjusted logistic regression models were used to ascertain \nassociations between PM2.5 and NDI (exposures) and presence or absence of CLS-B \n(outcome); CD68-positive adipose macrophages were modeled as a dichotomous high \nor low variable. Covariate-adjusted linear regression was used to identify \nassociations between CLS-B (exposure) and DNA methylation (outcome).\nRESULTS: The cohort included 205 participants (127 Black [62.0%], 78 White \n[38.0%] women; mean [SD] age, 48.7 [13.3] years). Women with vs without CLS-B \nhad higher median (IQR) body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms \ndivided by height in meters squared; 35.5 [30.5-40.9] vs 31.8 [26.6-36.4]; \nP = .02). Higher levels of PM2.5 (odds ratio [OR], 2.32; 95% CI, 1.12-4.78; \nP = .02) and NDI (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.02-1.43; P = .03) were associated with \npresence of CLS-B overall; findings were still significant among Black women \n(PM2.5: OR, 2.64 [95% CI, 1.10-6.33], P = .03; NDI: OR, 1.22 [95% CI, \n1.01-1.48], P = .04) but were not statistically significant among White women \n(PM2.5: OR, 1.65 [95% CI, 0.45-5.99], P = .45; NDI: OR, 1.19 [95% CI, \n0.83-1.70], P = .35). Higher PM2.5 concentration was associated with increased \nmacrophage infiltration (OR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.24-3.60; P = .006), with similar \noutcomes by race. The top 2 significant differentially methylated CpG sites by \nCLS-B status were SAR1B (β = 0.01; 95% CI, 0.01-0.02; P < .001) and IL2RB \n(β = -0.04; 95% CI, -0.05 to -0.02; P < .001). Significant interaction was \nobserved between CLS-B status and race for IL2RB methylation levels (β = -0.03; \n95% CI, -0.04 to -0.01; P for interaction <.001).\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cross-sectional study uncovered an association \nbetween neighborhood-level social and environmental risk factors and breast \ntissue inflammation. The findings help inform efforts to reduce racial and \nsocioeconomic disparities in breast cancer and improve health equity for \nsocially vulnerable populations.\n\nDOI: 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.61334\nPMCID: PMC11851241\nPMID: 39992653 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: Conflict of Interest Disclosures: None reported."

The aims were to \nevaluate the expression of OPN after caloric restriction-induced weight loss in \nadipose tissue (AT) from an animal model of diet-induced obesity (DIO) and to \nreflect these results on circulating OPN levels in patients with obesity (PWO); \nand to explore the effect of a very low-calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) on the \ncirculating protein and DNA methylation levels of OPN, compared with a balanced \nhypocaloric diet (LCD) or bariatric surgery (BS) in PWO.\nMETHODS: OPN/SPP1 expression was evaluated in subcutaneous (SAT) and visceral \n(VAT) AT derived from diet-induced obesity (DIO) mice and after a 4-week \nweight-loss protocol of calorie restriction (CR). Plasmatic OPN was also \nevaluated in 32 normal-weight volunteers (20 women) and 79 PWO (59 women) and \nafter a 4-6 months follow up of a VLCKD (n = 20), BS (n = 39) or LCD (n = 20). \nDNA methylation levels of OPN were extracted from our Infinium \nHumanMethylation450 BeadChips data sets.\nRESULTS: OPN levels were higher in VAT of DIO mice and plasma of PWO than in \nnormal-weight individuals and changed after weight loss. Particularly, \ncirculating OPN increased 2 months after BS while it decreased at maximum \nketosis-induced by VLCKD. A statistically significant decrease was also observed \nin methylation levels at cg11226901 after VLCKD.\nCONCLUSIONS: OPN levels were reduced after VLCKD and severely increased after \nBS. Therefore, it could be a biomarker of the obesity-related metabolic stress \nand could be epigenetically regulated.\n\nCopyright © 2025 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

We tested whether accumulated epigenetic change in smokers \nis apparent in bronchial basal cells as cells of origin of squamous cell \ncarcinoma. Using an EM-seq platform covering 53.8 million CpGs (96% of the \nentire genome) at an average of 7.5 sequencing reads per CpG site at a single \nbase resolution, we evaluated cytology-normal basal cells bronchoscopically \nbrushed from the in situ tobacco smoke-exposed 'bronchial epithelial field' and \nisolated by short-term primary culture from 54 human subjects. We found that \nmean methylation was globally lower in ever (former and current) smokers versus \nnever smokers (p = 0.0013) across promoters, CpG shores, exons, introns, \n3'-UTRs, and intergenic regions, but not in CpG islands. Among 6mers with \ndinucleotides flanking CpG, those containing CGCG showed no effect from smoking, \nwhile those flanked with TT and AA displayed the strongest effects. At the gene \nlevel, smoking-related differences in methylation level were observed in CDKL1, \nARTN, EDC3, CYP1B1, FAM131A, and MAGI2. Among candidate cancer genes, smoking \nreduced the methylation level in KRAS, ROS1, CDKN1A, CHRNB4, and CADM1. We \nconclude that smoking reduces long-term epigenome-wide methylation in bronchial \nstem cells, is impacted by the flanking sequence, and persists indefinitely \nbeyond smoking cessation.\n\nPlain Language Summary: In an epigenome-wide survey of normal bronchial cells \nbrushed and primary-cultured from 54 donors, average cytosine methylation was \nglobally lower and, equally so, in both former and current smokers versus never \nsmokers across almost all genome compartments.At the gene level, smoking-related \ngenome-wide significant differences in methylation level were observed in six \nagnostically uncovered, previously suspected carcinogenesis genes and another \nfive genes among 40 a priori-selected candidate cancer genes.It is concluded \nthat smoking reduces long-term epigenome-wide methylation in bronchial stem \ncells in cancer-related genes and persists indefinitely beyond smoking \ncessation, suggesting a possible decades-long epigenetic trace of risk for lung \ncancer and other lung disorders.\n\nDOI: 10.1080/15592294.2025.2466382\nPMCID: PMC11849931\nPMID: 39980243 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: No potential conflict of interest was reported \nby the author(s)."

This study aims to elucidate the molecular mechanisms and potential \nbiomarkers associated with this exposure in lung cancer patients. We integrated \ngene expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas lung cancer cohort and the \nComparative Toxicogenomics Database to identify differentially expressed genes \n(DEGs) associated with BaP and nicotine exposure. Enrichment analyses, survival \nanalyses, and immune cell infiltration analyses were conducted to interpret the \nbiological significance of these DEGs. A risk score model and a nomogram were \nconstructed for a prognostic evaluation. We identified 163 DEGs related to BaP \nand nicotine exposure in lung cancer. Enrichment analysis revealed significant \nbiological processes and pathways, including \"IL-17 signaling\", \"cellular \nsenescence\", and \"p53 signaling\". From the DEGs, 34 prognostic genes were \nidentified, with CLDN5, DNASE1L3, and GPR37 being independent prognostic \nfactors. A risk score model based on these genes showed significant prognostic \nvalue, with high-risk patients exhibiting poorer survival outcomes. \nAdditionally, a nomogram based on these risk scores demonstrated good predictive \naccuracy and clinical utility. Kaplan-Meier analyses confirmed that high \nexpression of CLDN5 and GPR37 correlated with poor survival, while high DNASE1L3 \nexpression indicated better survival. Single-gene enrichment analyses linked \nthese genes to immune responses, cell adhesion, and DNA methylation. Immune cell \ninfiltration analysis revealed significant correlations between the expression \nof these genes and the infiltration of various immune cell types. Our findings \nhighlight the significant role of CLDN5, DNASE1L3, and GPR37 in lung cancer \nassociated with BaP and nicotine exposure. The constructed risk score model and \nnomogram provide valuable tools for prognostication, and the identified genes \noffer potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Understanding the \ninfluence of toxic exposure on the tumor-immune microenvironment can guide \nfuture research and treatment strategies.\n\nDOI: 10.1021/acs.chemrestox.4c00469\nPMID: 39980136 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

These complexes play a crucial \nrole in the regulation of gene transcription and the modification of chromatin \nstructures. The aberrant expression of BRD1 is frequently observed across a \nrange of cancer types, including hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). However, the \nprecise mechanisms through which BRD1 contributes to tumorigenesis, especially \nin HCC, remain unclear. In our investigation, we have uncovered a novel role for \nBRD1 as an oncogene implicated the regulation of lipid metabolism in HCC \nprogression. Specifically, the deficiency of BRD1 impedes the proliferation and \nmetastasis of HCC cells reducing the accumulation of lipid droplets and \ncholesterol levels. This effect is mediated through the SREBF1-induced \ndownregulation of SCD1 expression in HCC cells. Mechanistically, the ablation of \nBRD1 disrupts acetylation level of H3K9, culminating in the subsequent \ntrimethylation of H3K9 (H3K9me3). Notably, the H3K14ac partially colocalizes \nwith H3K9me3 and its methyltransferase SETDB1 to from a double labeling of both \nH3K14ac and H3K9me3 at the SREBF1 promoter. This double labeling contributes to \nthe creation of a repressive environment, ultimately leading to the \ndownregulation of SREBF1 gene expression in HCC. Furthermore, the combinatorial \nuse of a BRD1 inhibitor and simvastatin augments antitumor efficacy in vivo. \nCollectively, our findings underscore BRD1 as a critical regulator of \nSREBF1-associated lipid metabolism and a participant in HCC progression through \na distinct epigenetic regulatory mechanism. These discoveries further suggest a \npromising epigenetic therapeutic approach for the treatment of HCC.\n\n© 2025.

Unlike sporadic \nCRC, local persistent inflammation in IBD induces genetic and epigenetic \nalterations, leading to tumor development. Moreover, cumulative data indicate \nthat colorectal polyps display a significant malignant potential. In this \ncontext, our study aimed to investigate the clinicopathological features of CRC \nassociated with IBD and/or colorectal neoplastic polyps in a retrospective group \nof CRC cases. The clinical data and histopathological features of CRC cases have \nbeen collected from our files. Immunohistochemical examination of mismatch \nrepair (MMR) proteins has been performed in a selected case. The study group \ncomprised 40 patients, 72.5% men and 27.5% women, with a median age of \n64.73±9.09 years. Out of the cases with double association, 62.5% of CRC cases \ndisplayed colorectal polyps, while 32.5% of patients were diagnosed with both \nCRC and IBD, which encompassed both ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease \n(CD). Two patients included in our study group exhibited a triple association of \nIBD, colorectal polyps, and CRC, one of them showing defective MMR (dMMR) \nphenotype. Although our results provide significant data on the relationship \nbetween IBD, colorectal polyps, and colorectal carcinogenesis, future cohort \nstudies are needed to improve our understanding on the complex mechanism of \ncolorectal carcinogenesis, ultimately guiding improved prevention, diagnosis, \nand treatment strategies for these patients.\n\nDOI: 10.47162/RJME.65.4.21\nPMCID: PMC11924904\nPMID: 39957036 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that they have no conflict \nof interests."

However, the impact of \nBRD4 and its associated genes on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. \nHCC is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths globally, often \ndiagnosed at an advanced stage, limiting treatment options. In this study, we \ncurated BRD4-interacting genes and, through analysis of the TCGA-LIHC dataset, \ndeveloped a four-gene prognostic model for HCC comprising EZH2, KIF20A, G6PD, \nand KIF2C. This model demonstrated strong predictive power in both training and \nvalidation cohorts, with high gene expression levels significantly correlating \nwith poor prognosis. Furthermore, our analysis revealed significant \nimmunological differences between risk groups and identified increased drug \nsensitivity in high-risk patients to certain medications, while decreased \nsensitivity to others. Experimental validation further indicated that the \ncombination of BRD4 inhibitor ZBC260 and EZH2 inhibitor CPI-169 synergistically \nenhanced apoptosis in HCC. Collectively, this study provides a scientific \nrationale for early HCC diagnosis and personalized therapy, offering new \ninsights into drug resistance in treatment.\n\n© 2025.

MicroRNAs \n(miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that influence several regulatory pathways. \nPreviously, we monitored the expressions of hsa-miR-223-5p, 16-5p, 20a-5p, \n-17-5p, 34a-5p, and 106a-5p in AMs derived from the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) \nof subjects with NSCLC, COPD, and smoker and non-smoker control groups. Here, we \ninvestigated the capability of CS conditionate media to modulate the \nabovementioned miRNAs in primary AMs obtained in the same 43 sex-matched \nsubjects. The expressions of has-miR-34a-5p, 17-5p, 16-5p, 106a-5p, 223-5p, and \n20a-5p were assessed before and after in vitro CS exposure by RT-PCR. In \naddition, a comprehensive bioinformatic analysis of miRNAs KEGGS and PPI linked \nto inflammation was performed. Distinct and common miRNA expression profiles \nwere identified in response to CS, suggesting their possible role in \nsmoking-related diseases. It is worth noting that, following exposure to CS, the \nexpression levels of hsa-miR-34a-5p and 17-5p in both smokers and non-smokers, \n106a-5p in non-smokers, and 20a-5p in smokers, shifted towards those found in \nindividuals with COPD, suggesting them as a risk factor in developing this lung \ncondition.

These issues, in combination with side effects and obstacles \nassociated with the current standard of care, generate considerable interest in \nnew potential targets for treatment as well as means for BC prevention. One \npotential preventive compound is Withaferin A (WFA), a traditional medicinal \ncompound found in winter cherries. WFA has shown promise as an anticancer agent \nand is thought to act primarily through its effects on the epigenome, including, \nin particular, the methylome. However, the relative importance of specific \ngenes' methylation states to WFA function remains unclear. To address this, we \nutilized human BC cell lines in combination with CRISPR-dCas9 fused to DNA \nmethylation modifiers (i.e., epigenetic editors) to elucidate the importance of \nspecific genes' promoter methylation states to WFA function and cancer cell \nviability. We found that targeted demethylation of promoters of the tumor \nsuppressors p21 and p53 within MDA-MB-231/MCF7 cells resulted in around \n1.7×/1.5× and 1.2×/1.3× increases in expression, respectively. Targeted \nmethylation of the promoter of the oncogene CCND1 within MDA-MB-231/MCF7 cells \nresulted in 0.5×/0.8× decreases in gene expression. These changes to p21, p53, \nand CCND1 were also associated with decreases in cell viability of around \n25%/50%, 5%/35%, and 12%/16%, respectively, for MDA-MB-231/MCF7 cells. When \ngiven in combination with WFA in both p53 mutant and wild type cells, we \ndiscovered that targeted methylation of the p21 promoter was able to modulate \nthe anticancer effects of WFA, while targeted methylation or demethylation of \nthe promoters of p53 and CCND1 had no significant effect on viability decreases \nfrom WFA treatment. Taken together, these results indicate that p21, p53, and \nCCND1 may be important targets for future in vivo studies that may lead to \nepigenetic editing therapies and that WFA may have utility in the prevention of \nBC through its effect on p21 promoter methylation independent of p53 function.\n\nDOI: 10.3390/ijms26031210\nPMCID: PMC11818515\nPMID: 39940977 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare no conflicts of interest."

Benzene's \ncarcinogenicity stems from its metabolic activation, leading to increased \noxidative stress, DNA damage, and cancer transformation. While its toxicity is \nwell-documented, the link between genetic and epigenetic alterations and cancer \nsusceptibility in exposed workers remains underexplored. This study aims to \nidentify early biomarkers of benzene exposure and AML risk by analyzing gene \nexpression and DNA methylation datasets from GEO DataSets, integrated with \nmolecular pathway analyses, as well as miRNA-target and protein-protein network \nevaluations. This multi-approach led to the identification of nine deregulated \ngenes (CRK, CXCR6, GSPT1, KPNA1, MECP2, MELTF, NFKB1, TBC1D7, ZNF331) in workers \nexposed to benzene, with NFKB1 showing strong discriminatory potential. Also, \ndose-dependent DNA methylation changes were observed in CXCR6 and MELTF, while \nselected miRNAs such as let-7d-5p, miR-126-3p, and miR-361-5p emerged as key \npost-transcriptional regulators. Furthermore, functional enrichment linked these \ngenes to immune response, inflammation, cell proliferation, and apoptosis \npathways. While network analyses highlighted NFKB1, CRK, and CXCR6 as central to \nbenzene-associated leukemogenesis. Altogether, these findings provide novel \ninsights into an early biomarker fingerprint for benzene exposure and AML \nsusceptibility, supporting the future development of biomolecular-based targeted \noccupational health monitoring and personalized preventive strategies for \nat-risk workers.\n\nDOI: 10.3390/ijms26031138\nPMCID: PMC11818736\nPMID: 39940906 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare no conflicts of interest."

Because of the \n8% cancer risk, many vulvar HSIL patients undergo aggressive and mutilating \ntreatments. Characterizing HSIL by their progression risk can help individualize \ntreatment strategies. Accordingly, copy number alterations (CNAs) and DNA \nmethylation have been identified as biomarkers for cancer risk stratification of \nHSIL. Here, we assessed their potential correlation, and relation to HPV16 \n(sub)lineages and progression to vulvar cancer. Eighty-two vulvar formalin-fixed \nparaffin-embedded (FFPE) samples, including controls, HSIL, HSIL adjacent to \nVSCC and VSCC, with previously determined DNA methylation profiles, were \nanalysed for CNAs using mFAST-SeqS. Genome-wide z-scores were calculated to \ndetermine overall aneuploidy (aneuploidy scores), and compared to the \nmethylation levels and status of marker panel ZNF582/SST/miR124-2. For 52 \nHPV16-positive cases, HPV (sub)lineages were determined by Sanger sequencing. \nHPV16 lineage A was predominant (86.4%), followed equally by lineages B, C, and \nD. Frequent chromosomal alterations included chr1pq, chr3q, chr9q gains, and \nchr2q, chr4q losses. Median aneuploidy scores increased across disease \ncategories, from 0 in controls, to 3 in HSIL, 16 in HSIL adjacent to VSCC and 29 \nin VSCC. A positive relationship between aneuploidy scores and DNA methylation \nlevels was found (ρ = 0.61, Spearman's rank correlation test). Aneuploidy scores \nwere significantly higher in methylation-positive samples (p < .001). In \nconclusion, we showed that DNA methylation and CNAs both rise with increasing \nseverity of disease, indicating their prognostic value for cancer risk \nstratification of HSIL, while no relation to HPV16 (sub)lineages was found.\n\n© 2025 The Author(s).

Esopredict is a novel validated methylation-based biomarker assay \nthat provides precise quantification of neoplastic progression risk in BE \npatients. Inherit challenges, including tissue heterogeneity, sampling error, \ninterobserver variability, and inconsistent adherence to surveillance biopsy \nguidelines, may affect the predictive value results of Esopredict obtained at \ndifferent anatomic locations or different sampling time points.\nMETHODS: To investigate the spatiotemporal performance of Esopredict across \nmultiple spatiotemporal sampling points, we profiled 220 biopsies obtained from \n58 BE patients, including 11 patients with overlapping spatial and temporal \nbiopsies. We focused on spatial profiling (i.e., multiple biopsies obtained at \nseveral anatomic locations during a single endoscopy) and temporal profiling \n(i.e., biopsies obtained from multiple endoscopies performed at different time \npoints). Each patient had an initial histologic diagnosis of nondysplastic \nBarrett esophagus, indefinite for dysplasia, or low-grade dysplasia. Final \nfollow-up (endpoint) biopsies showed either high-grade dysplasia or EAC \n(progressors), or nondysplastic Barrett esophagus, indefinite for dysplasia, or \nlow-grade dysplasia (nonprogressors). Biopsies were analyzed with Esopredict to \ncompute a progression risk score, which quantified the likelihood of future \nprogression to high-grade dysplasia or EAC within 5 years.\nRESULTS: In 52 spatially profiled patients, Esopredict demonstrated a \nsensitivity of 81% (17/21 progressor patients), based on the highest-scoring \nbiopsy from each patient; sensitivity increased to 100% (12/12) when end point \nbiopsies occurred within 5 years of the index (initial) biopsy. In 28 temporally \nprofiled patients, sensitivity was 100% (8/8 patients), based on the biopsy \nperformed at the time point closest to the end point biopsy.\nDISCUSSION: Esopredict showed high predictive performance in multiple \nspatiotemporal samples in BE patients. These data further support the use of \nEsopredict as a robust test to distinguish high-risk BE patients, who may \nbenefit from endoscopic eradication therapy or increased surveillance frequency, \nfrom low-risk patients, who may be candidates for less frequent surveillance and \nnoninterventional observation.\n\nCopyright © 2025 The Author(s).

Among recent innovations, \nproteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) represent a burgeoning chemical \nknockdown technology capable of degrading oncogenic protein homeostasis and \ninducing dynamic alternations within carcinoma settings, offering potential for \nantitumor manipulation. However, achieving selectivity in PROTACs that respond \nto disease environmental stimulation and precisely perturb on-target proteins \nremains challenging. The multi-step synthesis and limited permeability, \nattributed to high-molecular-weight and heterobifunctional structures, further \nhinder their in vivo efficacy. Herein, we present a unique TME-responsive \nenzyme-activated clickable PROTACs, which features a short peptide-tagged \npomalidomide derivative to undergo tumor-specific cleavage by cathepsin protease \nto induce orthogonal crosslinking of the exposed cysteine with \n2-cyanobenzothiazole-labeled epigenetic protein-ligand JQ1, facilitating in situ \ndegrader formation within tumor regions only. Systematic protein profiling and \nproteomic analysis revealed that such TME-specific clickable-PROTACs not only \nselectively eliminate epigenetic proteins without tedious pre-synthesis to \nbridge disparate small-molecule bi-warhead fragments, but also demonstrated \nsuperior tumor penetration compared to conventional high-molecular-weight \nPROTACs. Importantly, these clickable-PROTACs efficiently downregulated immune \ncheckpoint programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) both in vitro and in vivo, \nremodeling TME for enhanced therapeutics, especially in anti-tumoral \nimmunomodulation.\n\n© 2025 Wiley-VCH GmbH.\n\nDOI: 10.1002/anie.202423057\nPMID: 39932237 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Chromatin remodeling accomplishes \nspecific chromatin condensation at distinct genomic loci and plays an essential \nrole in epigenetic regulation associated with various processes related to \ncancer development.\nMETHODS: Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between OC and control samples \nwere screened from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Genotype-Tissue Expression \n(GTEx) databases, combined with chromatin remodeling-related genes (CRRGs) \nobtained from the GeneCards database to identify differentially expressed CRRGs \n(DECRRGs). Enrichment analysis and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network \nwere performed on the DECRRGs. Prognostic genes of OC were screened using \nunivariate Cox and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) \nanalyses. A risk model based on prognostic genes was developed, and the survival \nprobability of OC patients in different risk groups was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier \n(KM) curve. Finally, the expression levels of prognostic genes were validated by \nquantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blotting.\nRESULTS: In total, 7 potential prognostic genes associated with the progression \nof OC patients were obtained, including ARID1B, ATRX, CHRAC1, HDAC1, INO80, \nMBD2, and SS18. Based on the expression level of prognostic genes, OC patients \nwere divided into high-risk group and low-risk group. Survival analysis \nindicated that patients classified into the high-risk group had higher mortality \nrates, which enables this prediction model to be utilized as an independent \npredictor of OC. Immunocorrelation analysis showed that low-risk patients were \nmore likely to benefit from immunotherapy.\nCONCLUSION: In this study, we have identified 7 prognostic genes, including \nARID1B, ATRX, CHRAC1, HDAC1, INO80, MBD2, and SS18. Overall, our findings \nprovided a foundation for further comprehension of the potential molecular \nmechanisms underlying OC pathogenesis and progression.\n\n© 2025 The Author(s).

One of the most researched epimutations is \npromoter methylation of breast cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1. This \nepimutation may arise de novo in somatic tissues, such as breast or ovarian \ncancer tissue, but has also been shown to be widely distributed throughout \ntissues. BRCA1 methylation detectable in peripheral blood has been associated \nwith the risk of both breast and ovarian cancer in patients without a germline \npathogenic variant status of this gene. The strength of this association \nsuggests that diagnostic screening for the BRCA1 epimutation should be \nconsidered with potential implications in cancer risk assessment. However, the \ndetection of BRCA1 epimutation may be challenging, as it is generally detectable \nat a very low level in blood.

Several predictive and prognostic models are used but \nhave considerable inaccuracy at individual level. We tried to increase \nprediction accuracy using a multi-omics strategy. We interrogated data from 1391 \nconsecutive, newly diagnosed subjects with AML, integrating information on \nmutation topography, DNA methylation, and transcriptomics. We developed an \nunsupervised multi-omics classification system (UAMOCS) with these data. UAMOCS \nprovides a multidimensional understanding of AML heterogeneity and stratifies \nsubjects into three cohorts: (a) UAMOCS1 [high lymphocyte activating 3 (LAG3) \nexpression, chromosome instability, myelodysplasia-related mutations]; (b) \nUAMOCS2 (monocytic-like profile, immune suppression and activated angiogenesis \nand hypoxia pathways); and (c) UAMOCS3 [CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha \n(CEBPA) mutations and MYC pathway activation]. UAMOCS distinguishes overall \nsurvival rates across the cohorts (TCGA P = 0.042; GSE71014 P = 0.043; \nihCAMs-AML, GSE102691 and GSE37642 all P < 0.001). The model's C-statistic is \ncomparable to the 2022 ELN risk classification (0.87 vs 0.82; P = 0.162), but \noffers a more nuanced distinction between intermediate- and high-risk groups. \nWhen combined with high-throughput drug sensitivity testing, UAMOCS can \naccurately predict sensitivity to azacitidine (AZA) and venetoclax. The UAMOCS \nsystem is available as an R package. The UAMOCS system has the potential to \nredefine AML subtypes, enhance prognostic predictions, and guide treatment \nstrategies based on patients' immune status and expected responses to therapies.\n\n© 2025 The Author(s).

Weighted gene \nco-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and correlation analysis were applied to \nidentify gene modules underlying the classification of immune \"hot\" and \"cold\" \ntumors. Subsequently, 101 machine learning algorithm combinations were employed \nto construct a prognostic model based on the identified gene modules. \nSingle-cell analysis was conducted to investigate cellular interactions \nassociated with the immune-determinant gene module. Finally, immunofluorescence \nstaining for CD8, CD45, and CXCR4 was performed on human GC tissue samples.\nRESULTS: A total of 1,298 GC patients were included in this comprehensive \nanalysis. For the first time, we identified and characterized immune \"hot\" and \n\"cold\" tumors in GC patients, revealing distinct molecular features associated \nwith these tumor types. Immune \"hot\" tumor-related genes were identified, and \ntheir functional roles were validated through biological behavior analysis. A \nprognostic signature, termed the hot tumor top regulators (HTTR), was developed \nusing 101 machine learning algorithm combinations. The HTTR signature emerged as \nan independent prognostic factor, effectively stratifying patients into low- and \nhigh-risk groups with significant differences in overall survival. High-risk \ngroups demonstrated strong associations with immune checkpoint regulation, \nantigen presentation, and inhibitory pathways. Notably, single-cell analysis \nrevealed that HTTR genes were highly active in CD8 + T cells, with the \nCXCL12-CXCR4 axis playing a critical role in mediating interactions between \nCD8 + T cells and endothelial cells.\nCONCLUSION: In conclusion, the HTTR signature served as a robust prognostic \nbiomarker for GC patients and effectively identified those with immune \"hot\" \ntumors.

Mendelian randomization (MR) is a robust method \nfor establishing causality, as it reduces biases from confounding factors and \nreverse causation. This study uses MR to investigate the effects of three types \nof EDCs, including bisphenols, parabens, and phthalates, on the risk of overall \nbreast cancer and its subtypes-Luminal A, Luminal B, triple negative, human \nepidermal growth factor receptor 2-enriched, and estrogen \nreceptor-positive/negative. The study also examines the 1400 blood metabolome as \npotential mediators and explores EDCs-associated DNA methylation changes as \npotential factors, with a focus on European populations. Our results shows that \nn-butyl paraben (n-BuP) is positively associated with Luminal A, mono-methyl \nphthalate is negatively associated with Luminal B, and mono-iso-butyl phthalate \n(MiBP) is positively associated with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). \nMediation analysis reveals that blood metabolites, such as caffeic acid sulfate \nand the caffeine-to-paraxanthine ratio, mediate the effect of n-BuP on Luminal \nA, while methylsuccinate mediate the effect of MiBP on TNBC. Epigenetic analysis \nshows associations between EDCs exposure-related DNA methylation changes at \nspecific CpG sites (cg26325335, cg08537847, cg27454300) and different breast \ncancer risks. These findings not only suggest potential biomarkers for early \ndetection and intervention but also underscore the imperative for further \nresearch to rigorously validate these associations.\n\nCopyright © 2025 The Authors.

One way the immune system \nfights back is by inducing ferroptosis, a type of cell death, in tumor cells \nthrough CD8 + T cells. This involves lipid peroxidation and enzymes like \nlysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3 (Lpcat3), which makes cells more prone \nto ferroptosis. However, the mechanisms by which cancer cells avoid \nimmunotherapy-mediated ferroptosis are unclear. Our study reveals how cancer \ncells evade ferroptosis and anti-tumor immunity through the upregulation of \nfatty acid-binding protein 7 (Fabp7).\nMETHODS: To explore how cancer cells resist immune cell-mediated ferroptosis, we \nused a comprehensive range of techniques. We worked with cell lines including \nPD1-sensitive, PD1-resistant, B16F10, and QPP7 glioblastoma cells, and conducted \nin vivo studies in syngeneic 129 Sv/Ev, C57BL/6, and conditional knockout mice \nwith Rora deletion specifically in CD8+ T cells, Cd8 cre;Rorafl mice. Methods \nincluded mass spectrometry-based lipidomics, targeted lipidomics, Oil Red O \nstaining, Seahorse analysis, quantitative PCR, immunohistochemistry, PPARγ \ntranscription factor assays, ChIP-seq, untargeted lipidomic analysis, ROS assay, \nex vivo co-culture of CD8+ T cells with cancer cells, ATAC-seq, RNA-seq, Western \nblotting, co-immunoprecipitation assay, flow cytometry and Imaging Mass \nCytometry.\nRESULTS: PD1-resistant tumors upregulate Fabp7, driving protective metabolic \nchanges that shield cells from ferroptosis and evade anti-tumor immunity. Fabp7 \ndecreases the transcription of ferroptosis-inducing genes like Lpcat3 and \nincreases the transcription of ferroptosis-protective genes such as Bmal1 \nthrough epigenetic reprogramming. Lipidomic profiling revealed that Fabp7 \nincreases triglycerides and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), which impede \nlipid peroxidation and ROS generation. Fabp7 also improves mitochondrial \nfunction and fatty acid oxidation (FAO), enhancing cancer cell survival. \nFurthermore, cancer cells increase Fabp7 expression in CD8+ T cells, disrupting \ncircadian clock gene expression and triggering apoptosis through p53 \nstabilization. Clinical trial data revealed that higher FABP7 expression \ncorrelates with poorer overall survival and progression-free survival in \npatients undergoing immunotherapy.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study uncovers a novel mechanism by which cancer cells evade \nimmune-mediated ferroptosis through Fabp7 upregulation. This protein reprograms \nlipid metabolism and disrupts circadian regulation in immune cells, promoting \ntumor survival and resistance to immunotherapy. Targeting Fabp7 could enhance \nimmunotherapy effectiveness by re-sensitizing resistant tumors to ferroptosis.\n\n© 2025.

The association of diet with cancer etiology and prevention has \nbeen well established and nutrition has been shown to regulate cancer through \nmodulation of epigenetic markers. Dietary fatty acids, especially omega-3, \nreduce the risk of cancer by preventing or reversing the progression through a \nvariety of cellular targets, including epigenetic regulation. In this work, we \nhave evaluated the potential of ALA (α linolenic acid), an ω-3 fatty acid, to \nregulate cervical cancer through epigenetic mechanisms. The effect of ALA was \nevaluated on the regulation of histone deacetylases1, DNA methyltransferases 1, \nand 3b, and global DNA methylation by ELISA. RT-PCR was utilized to assess the \nexpression of tumor regulatory genes (hTERT, DAPK, RARβ, and CDH1) and their \npromoter methylation in HeLa (HPV18-positive), SiHa (HPV16-positive) and C33a \n(HPV-negative) cervical cancer cell lines. ALA increased DNA demethylase, HMTs, \nand HATs while decreasing global DNA methylation, DNMT, HDMs, and HDACs mRNA \nexpression/activity in all cervical cancer cell lines. ALA downregulated hTERT \noncogene while upregulating the mRNA expression of TSGs (Tumor Suppressor Genes) \nCDH1, RARβ, and DAPK in all the cell lines. ALA reduced methylation in the 5' \nCpG island of CDH1, RARβ, and DAPK1 promoters and reduced global DNA methylation \nin cervical cancer cell lines. These results suggest that ALA regulates the \ngrowth of cervical cancer cells by targeting epigenetic markers, shedding light \non its potential therapeutic role in cervical cancer management.\n\nDOI: 10.1080/15592294.2025.2451551\nPMCID: PMC11792827\nPMID: 39895102 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: No potential conflict of interest was reported \nby the author(s)."

This specialized group of proteins is responsible for controlling the \norganization of genomic DNA in a cell-type specific fashion, controlling normal \ndevelopment in a spatial and temporal fashion. Moreover, mutations in epigenes \nhave been implicated as causal in germline pediatric disorders and as driver \nmutations in cancer. Despite their importance to human disease, to date, there \nhas not been a systematic analysis of the sources of functional diversity for \nepigenes at large. Epigenes' unique functions that require the assembly of pools \nwithin the nucleus suggest that their structure and amino acid composition would \nhave been enriched for features that enable efficient assembly of chromatin and \nDNA for transcription, splicing, and post-translational modifications.\nRESULTS: In this study, we assess the functional diversity stemming from gene \nstructure, isoforms, protein domains, and multiprotein complex formation that \ndrive the functions of established epigenes. We found that there are specific \nstructural features that enable epigenes to perform their variable roles \ndepending on the cellular and environmental context. First, epigenes are \nsignificantly larger and have more exons compared with non-epigenes which \ncontributes to increased isoform diversity. Second epigenes participate in more \nmultimeric complexes than non-epigenes. Thirdly, given their proposed importance \nin membraneless organelles, we show epigenes are enriched for substantially \nlarger intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). Additionally, we assessed the \nspecificity of their expression profiles and showed epigenes are more \nubiquitously expressed consistent with their enrichment in pediatric syndromes \nwith intellectual disability, multiorgan dysfunction, and developmental delay. \nFinally, in the L1000 dataset, we identify drugs that can potentially be used to \nmodulate expression of these genes.\nCONCLUSIONS: Here we identify significant differences in isoform usage, \ndisordered domain content, and variable binding partners between human epigenes \nand non-epigenes using various functional genomics datasets from Ensembl, \nENCODE, GTEx, HPO, LINCS L1000, and BrainSpan. Our results contribute new \nknowledge to the growing field focused on developing targeted therapies for \ndiseases caused by epigene mutations, such as chromatinopathies and cancers.\n\n© 2025.

One of its hallmarks is hypermethylation, \nparticularly in genes responsible for DNA repair. This study aimed to evaluate \nthe methylation and mutation status of DNA repair genes (single-strand - XPA, \nXPC, XPG, CSA, CSB and double-strand - ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, LIG4, RAD51) in MDS \nacross three patient cohorts (Cohort A-56, Cohort B-100, Cohort C-76), using \nmethods like pyrosequencing, real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry, and mutation \nscreening. Results showed that XPA had higher methylation in low-risk MDS \ncompared to high-risk MDS. For double-strand repair genes, ATM displayed higher \nmethylation in patients who transformed to AML (p = 0.016). ATM gene expression \nwas downregulated in MDS compared to controls (p = 0.042). When patients were \nclassified according to the WHO 2022 guidelines, ATM expression progressively \ndecreased from low-risk subtypes (e.g., Hypoplastic MDS) to high-risk MDS and \nAML. Patients who transformed to AML had a higher 5mC/5hmC ratio compared to \nthose who didn't (p = 0.045). Additionally, poor cytogenetic risk patients had \nhigher tissue methylation scores than those with good risk (p = 0.035). Analysis \nusing the cBioPortal platform identified ATM as the most frequently mutated DNA \nrepair gene, with various mutations, such as frameshift and missense, most of \nwhich were classified as oncogenic. The findings suggest that ATM is frequently \nsilenced or downregulated in MDS due to methylation or mutations, contributing \nto the progression to AML. This highlights ATM's potential role in the disease's \nadvancement and as a target for future therapeutic strategies.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

GBM is the most common, aggressive central nervous \nsystem tumor (CNS). It commonly originates in glial cells such as microglia, \noligodendroglia, astrocytes, or subpopulations of cancer stem cells (CSCs). \nGlucose plays an important role in the, which energy metabolism of normal and \ncancer cells, but cancer cells exhibit an increased demand for glucose is \nrequired for their differentiation and proliferation. The main aim of this study \nis to explore the anti-cancer efficacy of the ketogenic diet against GBM. Also, \nthis research focuses on the identification of the catalytic action of zinc in \nepigenetic modulators such as oxyresveratrol and ensures the combinatorial \neffect in the treatment of GBM.\nMETHOD: In this study, we have evaluated various parameters to understand the \ntherapeutic efficacy of the treatment groups through in vivo experiments against \naggressive brain tumors. Intracerebroventricular experiments were performed to \ninduce the tumor in the animals and estimate the tumor burden and proliferative \nindex. Followed by the Morris water maze, an open field test, and rota rod was \nperformed to evaluate the memory and motor coordination. To understand the \nglucose, and ketone level modification before and after treatment, the level of \nglucose and ketone was analyzed. Moreover, the zinc level is assessed using \nflame atomic absorption spectroscopy.\nRESULTS: The results suggested that the ketogenic diet has an anti-cancer \nefficacy against C6-induced GBM cell lines. Also, it exerts a synergistic effect \nwith the epigenetic modulator, oxyresveratrol, and zinc against GBM cell lines. \nMoreover, the treatment groups improved memory and motor coordination and \nmodified the glucose and ketone levels to reduce the tumor burden and Ki-67 \nproliferative index.\nCONCLUSION: This study revealed the therapeutic effect of the ketogenic diet \nalong with its combination such as oxyresveratrol and zinc against the \nC6-induced GBM in the Wistar rats.

Indeed, while DNA mutations are necessary drivers of cancer, \nonly a small subset of mutated cells go on to cause the disease. To date, the \nmechanisms underlying individual cancer susceptibility remain unclear. Here, we \ntook advantage of a unique mouse model of intrinsic developmental heterogeneity \n(Trim28+/D9) to investigate whether early-life epigenetic variation influences \ncancer susceptibility later in life. We found that heterozygosity of Trim28 is \nsufficient to generate two distinct early-life epigenetic states associated with \ndiffering cancer susceptibility. These developmentally primed states exhibit \ndifferential methylation patterns at typically silenced heterochromatin, \ndetectable as early as 10 days of age. The differentially methylated loci are \nenriched for genes with known oncogenic potential, frequently mutated in human \ncancers and correlated with poor prognosis. This study provides genetic evidence \nthat intrinsic developmental heterogeneity can prime individual, lifelong cancer \nsusceptibility.\n\n© 2025.

While the dysregulation \nof ERV transcription has been linked to immune cell infiltration in various \ncancers, its relationship with immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) response in \nsolid tumors, particularly metastatic clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), \nremains inadequately explored.\nMETHODS: This study analyzed patients with metastatic ccRCC from two prospective \nclinical trials, encompassing 181 patients receiving nivolumab in the CheckMate \ntrials (-009 to -010 and -025) and 48 patients treated with the \nipilimumab-nivolumab combination in the BIONIKK trial. ERV expression was \nquantified using the ERVmap algorithm from RNA sequencing data. Our primary \nobjective was to correlate ERV expression with progression-free survival, with \noverall survival and time-to-second-treatment survival as secondary endpoints. \nWe used bootstrap methods with univariate Cox regression on 666 substantially \nexpressed ERVs to evaluate their prognostic significance and stability.\nRESULTS: Our analysis centered on two ERVs, E4421_chr17 and E1659_chr4, which \nconsistently exhibited opposing prognostic impacts across both cohorts. We \ndeveloped a stratification system based on their median expression levels, \ncategorizing patients into four ERV subgroups. These subgroups were further \nconsolidated into a three-tier risk model that significantly correlated with ICI \ntreatment outcomes. The most responsive ERV risk category showed enhanced \nendothelial cell infiltration, whereas the resistant category was characterized \nby higher levels of myeloid dendritic cells, regulatory T cells, myeloid-derived \nsuppressor cells, and markers of T-cell exhaustion. Notably, this ERV-based \nclassification outperformed traditional transcriptomic signatures in predicting \nICI efficacy and showed further improvement when combined with epigenetic DNA \nmethylation markers.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings introduce a dual ERV-based stratification system that \neffectively categorizes patient risk and predicts clinical outcomes for ccRCC \npatients undergoing ICI therapy. Beyond enhancing the predictive precision of \nexisting transcriptomic models, this system paves the way for more targeted and \nindividualized approaches in the realm of precision oncology.\n\n© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.

These metabolites can modulate cellular \nmetabolism and induce epigenetic changes, inhibiting tumor growth. Nonetheless, \ncertain cancer cells may utilize ketone bodies, like BHB as nutrient sources \nunder hypoxic conditions, potentially reducing treatment efficacy. Understanding \nthese mechanisms is crucial for optimizing cancer therapies. This study \nevaluated the effects of BHB and α-KG on HCT-116 colorectal cancer cell \nviability under normoxic and low-glucose hypoxic conditions. HCT-116 cell lines \nwere treated with different doses of BHB and α-KG in normoxic and low-glucose \nhypoxic conditions, and then cell viability was assessed by the MTT assay. \nMoreover, the mRNA expression levels of SRC, hypoxia-inducible factor \n1α (HIF-1α), acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase 1 (ACAT1), and sirtuin 2 (SIRT2) genes \nwere determined using quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain \nreaction (q RT-PCR). BHB significantly increased the proliferation of HCT-116 \ncolon cancer cells under low-glucose hypoxic conditions, while α-KG maintained \ncell viability in normoxic conditions but not in hypoxia. BHB treatment reduced \nSIRT2 mRNA levels and increased ACAT1, SRC, and HIF-1α expression. Conversely, \nα-KG decreased ACAT1, SRC, and HIF-1α expression and increased SIRT2 levels in \nnormoxia but could not reverse gene expression during hypoxia. Our study \ndemonstrated that BHB and α-KG exhibited complex interactions with colon cancer \ncell viability under varying oxygen and glucose conditions. While BHB promoted \ncell proliferation in hypoxic environments, α-KG showed protective effects in \nnormoxic conditions. This research contributed to the growing body of evidence \nsupporting the role of metabolic modulators in cancer therapy and emphasized the \nimportance of understanding tumor microenvironments to optimize treatment \noutcomes. However, the need for further research into the metabolic pathways is \nunderscored to enhance therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment.\n\n© 2024.

Herein, we compared \nthe chemical composition and receptor-mediated activity of cannabis smoke \nextract (CaSE) to cannabis vaping extract (CaVE) along with the biological \nresponse in human bronchial epithelial cells. Chemical analysis using HPLC and \nGC/MS revealed that cannabis vaping aerosol contained fewer toxicants than \nsmoke; CaSE and CaVE contained teratogens, carcinogens, and respiratory \ntoxicants. A bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET)-based biosensor \ndetected the receptor-mediated activity of the extracts, primarily driven by \nΔ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) concentration. RNA-sequencing showed both CaSE \nand CaVE induced similar transcriptional responses, significantly upregulating \ngenes within pathways related to inflammation, cancer, and cellular stress. This \nwas paralleled by downregulation of pathways related to lipid synthesis and \nmetabolism from both CaSE and CaVE. Targeted metabolomics revealed significant \nchanges in metabolites involved in lipid and membrane metabolism, energy \nproduction, nucleotide/DNA/RNA pathways, and oxidative stress response, \nsuggesting potential impairment of lung epithelial cell repair and function. In \naddition, the upregulation of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) indicates \nepigenetic changes potentially contributing to inflammation, oxidative stress, \nand an increased risk of cancer. These findings challenge the notion that \ncannabis vaping is risk-free, highlighting an urgent need for comprehensive \nresearch into its respiratory health effects. This comparison of cannabis \nconsumption methods offers insights that could inform public health policies and \nraise consumer awareness regarding the potential risks of inhaling cannabis \naerosol.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Cannabis use is increasing worldwide amid broad \nacceptance and legalization. The prevalence of traditional smoking is \ndiminishing in favor of vaping dry flower. This is the first study to provide \ninitial evidence that cannabis aerosol contains carcinogenic, teratogenic, and \nrespiratory toxicants that induce transcriptional responses in epithelial cells \nanalogous to those from cannabis smoke, suggesting potential adverse pulmonary \neffects.\n\nDOI: 10.1152/ajplung.00131.2024\nPMID: 39823205 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Electronic address: \njavier.redondo@cib.csic.es.\n\nEpigenetic alterations are hallmarks of cancer, with histone modifiers playing \ncritical roles in gene transcription, DNA homeostasis, and other nuclear \nfunctions. Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1), a key regulator of H3K4 \nmethylation, has emerged as a promising pharmacological target in cancer \ntreatment, including leukemia. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the most \ncommon pediatric cancer, remains a significant therapeutic challenge due to \nlimited understanding of how epigenetic therapy impacts leukemia dissemination. \nIn this study, we demonstrate that targeting LSD1 enhances the invasive capacity \nof ALL cells, inducing an elongated, invasive phenotype and increasing nuclear \ndeformability. Using a 3D matrix model, LSD1 inhibition promoted ALL cell \ninvasion without significantly affecting the cell cycle progression or apoptosis \nunder the tested conditions. Interestingly, LSD1 targeting reduced ALL cell \nspreading and tissue colonization in vivo, suggesting differential effects \ndepending on the cellular context. Our findings indicate that LSD1 inhibition \nimpairs chemotactic responses and transendothelial migration, key processes for \nextravasation and in vivo invasiveness. These results reveal a dual role for \nLSD1 in leukemia cell migration: promoting invasiveness in 3D environments while \nreducing extravasation and chemotaxis in vivo. This dual effect underscores the \nimportance of cellular context in determining therapeutic outcomes and the \ndevelopment of strategies targeting specific stages of leukemia dissemination.\n\nCopyright © 2025 The Authors.

DNA \nmethylation patterns change markedly with one's age, serving as a biomarker of \nbiological age and closely linked to the occurrence and progression of \nage-related diseases. Currently, diagnostic methods for individual degenerative \ndiseases are relatively mature. However, aging often accompanies the onset of \nmultiple degenerative diseases, presenting certain limitations in existing \ndiagnostic models. Additionally, some identified DNA methylation biomarkers are \ntypically applicable to only one or a few types of cancer or diseases, further \nrestricting their utility. We endeavor to screen for biomarkers associated with \nmultiple degenerative diseases from the perspective of aging-related co-morbid \nmechanisms and to perform multiple degenerative disease diagnoses. In this \nstudy, we explored research based on methylation correlations and patterns to \ninvestigate shared mechanisms across multiple degenerative diseases, identifying \na set of biomarkers associated with them. We validated these biomarkers with \nbiological omics analysis and the prediction of multiple classes of degenerative \ndiseases, screened the biomarkers from 600 to 110 by biological omics analysis, \nand demonstrated the validity and predictive ability of the screened 110 \nbiomarkers. We propose a disease diagnostic model based on a multi-scale \none-dimensional convolutional neural network (MSDCNN) and a multi-class \ndegenerative disease prediction model (ResDegNet). The two models are well \ntrained and tested to accurately diagnose diseases and categorize four types of \ndegenerative diseases. The research identified 110 biomarkers associated with \ndegenerative diseases, providing a foundation for further exploration of \nage-related degenerative conditions. This work aims to facilitate early \ndiagnosis, the identification of biomarkers, and the development of therapeutic \ntargets for drug interventions.\n\nDOI: 10.3390/ijms26010313\nPMCID: PMC11719970\nPMID: 39796173 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare no conflicts of interest."

Our model predicts DNA \nmethylation-state correlation distributions arising from the transport and \nkinetic properties that are crucial for the establishment of unique methylation \nprofiles. We model the methylation correlation distributions of nine cancerous \nhuman cell types to determine how these properties affect the epigenetic \nprofile.

Risk \nfactors include environmental and genetic factors. Asbestos exposure is \nconsidered the principal environmental risk factor, but other carcinogenic \nmineral fibers, such as erionite, also have a causal role. Pathogenic germline \n(heritable) mutations of specific genes, especially BAP1, are thought to \npredispose the individual to mesothelioma in about 10% of cases. Somatic \nmutations and deletions of specific tumor suppressor genes, particularly BAP1, \nCDKN2A/B, and NF2, occur frequently in human mesothelioma, and asbestos-exposed \nmice with heterozygous deletions of any one of these genes have been shown to \ndevelop mesothelioma more often and at an accelerated rate than in control \nanimals. Autochthonous mesothelioma mouse models, which are genetically \nengineered to carry multiple genetic lesions matching those observed in the \nhuman disease counterpart, closely resemble the disease phenotype and the \nextensive inflammatory responses that characterize human mesothelioma. Because \nautochthonous mice do not require asbestos exposure and form tumors rapidly, \nthese models are invaluable for assessing novel therapeutic strategies in an \nimmunocompetent setting. The overlapping genetic, epigenetic, and immune \nenvironments of the tumors observed in these genetically engineered mouse models \n(GEMMs) and human primary mesothelioma specimens support the clinical relevance \nof these preclinical models.

To better understand the \nfunction of these modifications, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation followed \nby sequencing to map the genome-wide location of four short-chain acyl histone \nmarks, H3K18pr, H3K18bu, H4K12pr and H4K12bu, in treated and untreated \ncolorectal cancer (CRC) and normal cells as well as in mouse intestines in vivo. \nWe correlate these marks with open chromatin regions and gene expression to \naccess the function of the target regions. Our data demonstrate that propionate \nand butyrate bind and act as promoters of genes involved in growth, \ndifferentiation and ion transport.

African-American (AA) adults consume greater quantities \nof fructose and are more likely to develop right-side colon cancer than European \nAmerican (EA) adults.\nOBJECTIVES: We examined the hypothesis that fructose consumption leads to \nepigenomic and transcriptomic differences associated with CRC tumor biology.\nMETHODS: Deoxyribonucleic acid methylation data from this cross-sectional study \nwas obtained using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC kit (GSE151732). Right \nand left colon differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified using \nDMRcate through analysis of Food Frequency Questionnaire data on fructose \nconsumption in normal colon biopsies (n = 79) of AA adults undergoing screening \ncolonoscopy. Secondary analysis of CRC tumors was carried out using data derived \nfrom The Cancer Genome Atlas Colon Adenocarcinoma, GSE101764, and GSE193535. \nRight colon organoids derived from AA (n = 5) and EA (n = 5) adults were exposed \nto 4.4 mM of fructose for 72 h. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were \nidentified using DESeq2.\nRESULTS: We identified 4263 right colon fructose-associated DMRs \n[false-discovery rates (FDR) < 0.05]. In contrast, only 24 DMRs survived \nmultiple testing corrections (FDR < 0.05) in matched, left colon. Almost 50% of \nright colon fructose-associated DMRs overlapped regions implicated in CRC in ≥1 \nof 3 data sets. Highly significant enrichment was also observed between genes \ncorresponding to right colon fructose-associated DMRs and DEGs associated with \nfructose exposure in right colon organoids of AA individuals (P = 3.28E-30). \nOverlapping and significant enrichments for fatty acid metabolism, glycolysis, \nand cell proliferation pathways were also found. Cross-referencing genes within \nthese pathways to DEGs in CRC tumors reveal potential roles for ankyrin repeat \ndomain containing protein 23 and phosphofructokinase, platelet in \nfructose-mediated CRC risk for AA individuals.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our data support that dietary fructose exerts a greater CRC \nrisk-related effect in the right than left colon among AA adults, alluding to \nits potential role in contributing to racial disparities in CRC.\n\nCopyright © 2025 American Society for Nutrition.

Surfactant-associated 3 (SFTA3), a long non-coding RNA predominantly \nexpressed in normal lung epithelial cells, plays a crucial role in lung \ndevelopment. Nevertheless, its function in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remains \ninadequately understood.\nMETHODS: Single-cell RNA sequencing data were utilized to identify novel cancer \ncell-intrinsic gene signatures associated with the progression of LUAD, and \ntheir roles in LUAD were comprehensively analyzed. Serum samples were collected \nto quantify the expression levels of SFTA3 in LUAD patients. Furthermore, a \nseries of biological experiments, including cell viability assays, scratch wound \nhealing assays, and colony formation assays, were conducted to demonstrate the \ntumor-suppressive effects of SFTA3. RNA sequencing was performed to elucidate \nthe molecular mechanisms underlying the role of SFTA3 in lung cancer cells.\nRESULTS: We constructed a prognostic model comprising eight genes: ALDOA, \nATP5MD, SERPINH1, SFTA3, SLK, U2SURP, SCGB1A1, and SCGB1A3. The model \neffectively stratified patients into high- and low-risk categories, revealing \nthat low-risk patients experienced superior clinical outcomes, exhibited an \nimmunologically hot tumor microenvironment (TME), and had a greater probability \nof responding to immunotherapy. In contrast, the high-risk group exhibited a \ncold TME and may benefit more from chemotherapy. Furthermore, our study revealed \nthat a progressive decrease in SFTA3 expression in cancer cells was correlated \nwith tumor advancement. Notably, the serum levels of SFTA3 significantly \ndecreased in patients with LUAD, suggesting its potential utility in liquid \nbiopsy for LUAD diagnosis. Additionally, the knockdown of SFTA3 enhances the \nproliferation and migration of lung cancer cells, whereas its overexpression \ninhibits these phenotypes. The epithelial-mesenchymal transition pathway was \nsignificantly enriched following SFTA3 silencing, suggesting that SFTA3 may \nimpact tumor progression by modulating this process. We also identified key \ntranscription factors and epigenetic mechanisms implicated in the downregulation \nof SFTA3 in LUAD.\nCONCLUSION: We developed a robust prognostic model and identified SFTA3 as a \nnovel biomarker with potential applications in the diagnosis, prognosis, and \npersonalized treatment of LUAD. Additionally, our findings offer new insights \ninto the mechanisms underlying LUAD tumorigenesis and immune evasion.\n\n© 2025.

The mRNA expression \nlevels of NALCN were quantified in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and \nadjacent non-cancerous tissues, and it was found to be underexpressed in 54.5% \nof tumor tissues, with significantly higher expression in recurrence-free \npatients (p = 0.009) than in patients who relapsed. The NALCN methylation level \nwas not statisticallysignificantlycorrelated with the corresponding expression \n(p = 0.439), while Kaplan-Meier analysis showed an association between NALCN \npromoter hypermethylation and worse disease-free intervals (DFIs) (p = 0.017). \nEvaluation of NALCN methylation in ctDNA revealed that it was detected in 5.1% \nof early and 10.2% of advanced cases. Our results strongly suggest that \nepigenetic inactivation of NALCN may be a predictor of metastasis in NSCLC. Our \nresults should be validated in further studies based on a larger patient cohort \nto further investigate whether DNA methylation of the NALCN promoter could serve \nas a potential prognostic DNA methylation biomarker and predictor of metastasis \nin NSCLC.\n\nDOI: 10.3390/biom14121514\nPMCID: PMC11673096\nPMID: 39766220 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare no conflicts of interest."

Among the OPPs, Chlorpyrifos (CPF) is predominantly used \nand has been linked to various adverse health effects from acute to chronic \nexposure. Exposure to pesticides both occupationally and environmentally causes \nfrequent human health problems including neurological disorders, liver, kidney \ndysfunctions and cancer. The acute and chronic effects of these environmental \ntoxicants have been linked to epigenetic changes that appear shortly after \nexposure, but can last for a lifetime and possibly be passed down through \ngenerations. The present study investigates the effects of acute and chronic \nexposure to CPF, the predominantly used OPP globally on human liver cells, \nfocusing on the induction of DNA damage and epigenetic alterations. Human normal \nliver cells (WRL-68) were acutely and chronically exposed to varying \nconcentrations of CPF. The results revealed significant DNA damage, epigenetic \nchanges and the onset of neoplastic transformation as evidenced by alterations \nin the DNA repair genes, DNA methyltransferases markers, cell cycle markers, \nepithelial to mesenchymal transition markers (EMT) and loss of apoptosis. \nAdditionally, chronic CPF exposure led to increased colony formation, \nproliferation and migratory properties of normal liver cells indicating the \nneoplastic transformation of these cells. These findings highlight the potential \nof CPF to disrupt the cellular integrity and promote carcinogenesis in the liver \ncells. The present study underscores the impact of chronic CPF exposure in the \ninitiation of cancer and also highlights the importance of continued research to \nfully understand the chronic health implications of CPF, for developing targeted \ninterventions to mitigate its carcinogenic risks.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

It is \none of the most common forms of cancer, and its development is influenced by a \ncombination of hereditary, epigenetic, environmental, age, and lifestyle \nfactors. Given that it is the second most common cause of cancer-related deaths \nin men, it is crucial to comprehend its complex facets. Present research \nespecially targets the 3-kinase/protein kinase B, Epidermal Growth Factor \nReceptor, and extracellular signal-related kinase pathways, which are known to \nbe significantly involved in prostate cancer progression. Here, Rutin \nderivatives were screened against selected prostate cancer targets. Molecular \ndocking was performed to identify favorable interactions and the most promising \ncompound. Further, Density functional theory, pharmacokinetics, Molecular \ndynamics simulation, principal component analysis, free energy landscape \nanalysis, and Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area provided \nadditional insights into selecting the best drug candidate. Among all the \nselected rutin derivatives, RU4b1 has potent inhibitory action. We also \nperformed predictive analysis to identify the distinct metabolic sites within \nthe structure of RU4b1. RU4b1 also exhibits drug-like properties and potent \nantioxidant activity. The findings were also compared with standard drugs and \nreference molecules of the respective proteins, and it is noteworthy that RU4b1 \nexhibited superior action compared to the standard drugs and reference \nmolecules. This study aims to contribute valuable insights into developing \ntargeted therapies for prostate cancer, emphasizing the potential of rutin \nderivatives as effective anti-cancer agents.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

Current follow-up methods (serum carcinoembryonic \nantigen detection and PET-CT) lack sensitivity and reliability, necessitating a \nnovel approach. Analyzing cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from blood plasma emerges as a \npromising avenue. This study aims to evaluate the cost-effective and genome-wide \ncell-free reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (cfRRBS) method combined \nwith computational deconvolution for effective disease monitoring in EAC \npatients. cfDNA methylation profiling with cfRRBS was performed on 162 blood \nplasma samples from 33 EAC cancer patients and 28 blood plasma samples from 20 \nhealthy donors. The estimated tumor fraction for EAC patients at the time of \ndiagnosis was significantly different from the healthy donor plasma samples \n(one-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test: p-value = 0.032). Tumor fractions above 15% \nand focal gains/amplifications in MYC (chr8), KRAS (chr12), EGFR (chr7) and \nNOTCH2 (chr1) were observed in four samples of distinct patients at the time \nmetastatic disease was detected. This study showed feasibility to estimate tumor \nfractions in blood plasma of EAC patients based on cfDNA methylation using \ncfRRBS and computational deconvolution. Nevertheless, in this study only cancer \npatients with evidence of metastatic disease show high tumor fractions and copy \nnumber alterations.\n\n© 2024.

While endoscopy is \nrecommended for the detection of ECa in high-risk individuals, it is not \nsuitable for large-scale screening due to its invasiveness and inconvenience.\nMETHODS: In this study, a novel gene methylation panel was developed for a \nblood-based test, and its diagnostic efficacy was evaluated using a cohort of \n304 participants (203 cases, 101 controls). The assessment focused on the DNA \nmethylation levels of SEPTIN9, tissue factor pathway inhibitor 2 (TFPI2), and \nthe fragile histidine triad gene (FHIT) in patients with ECa, benign esophageal \ndisease, and healthy controls. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve \nwas generated for the panel to calculate the area under the curve (AUC), \nsensitivity, specificity, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), along with a \ncomparison to the gold standard of pathological examination. The consistency \nbetween biomarker and pathological diagnosis was evaluated with kappa analysis \nconducted with IBM SPSS Statistics. The Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test \nwas utilized to assess the association of test positivity with demographic \ncharacteristics.\nRESULTS: In patients with ECa, SEPTIN9, TFPI2, and FHIT DNA methylation levels \nwere significantly higher compared to those with benign esophageal disease or \nhealthy controls. The panel demonstrated promising potential as a noninvasive \ntool for distinguishing malignant tumors from both healthy controls and benign \nesophageal diseases, achieving an area under the ROC curve of 0.925 (95% CI: \n0.889-0.952), with a sensitivity of 79.8% [95% CI 73.6-85.1%] and specificity of \n95.0% [95% CI 88.8-98.4%]. In particular, the panel showed exceptional \ndiagnostic efficiency for stage 0, I, and II cancer patients with sensitivity at \n69.0, 75.5%, and 78.9%, respectively. The comparison revealed a Kappa value of \n0.725 between RT-PCR testing and the established gold standard of pathological \nexamination, indicating a high level of consistency. Additionally, there was no \nbias in diagnostic efficiency based on age, gender, or the presence of other \nmalignancies (non-esophageal cancers).\nCONCLUSIONS: The study's findings suggested that the DNA methylation biomarkers \npanel holds promise as a non-invasive and convenient diagnostic test for ECa. \nThe panel's ability to distinguish malignant tumors from benign esophageal \ndiseases, coupled with its high sensitivity and specificity, presented \nopportunities to enhance the over-all diagnosis of high-risk population when in \nconjunction with existing detection methods.\n\n© 2024.

However, the underlying epigenetic mechanism during \nPAHs-induced lung carcinogenesis has remained largely unknown. Previously, we \nscreened some novel epigenetic regulatory genes during 3-methylcholanthrene \n(3-MCA)-induced lung carcinogenesis, including the potassium inwardly rectifying \nchannel subfamily J member 15 (KCNJ15) gene. This study aimed to investigate the \nexpression regulation, function, and mechanism of KCNJ15 through database \nanalysis, malignant transformed cell model, and xenograft tumor models. We found \nthat KCNJ15 was remarkably under-expressed during lung carcinogenesis and \nprogression. High levels of DNA methylation led to low KCNJ15 expression in \n3-MCA-induced malignantly transformed HBE cells. High expression of KCNJ15 was \npositively correlated with good survival prognosis in lung cancer patients. \nKCNJ15 overexpression significantly inhibited the growth, invasion, and \nmigration of lung cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. Knockdown of KCNJ15 \nresulted in an opposite phenotype. KCNJ15 regulated the Hippo pathway by \nactivating YAP phosphorylation and inhibiting YAP expression. There was a \nsignificant protein-protein interaction between KCNJ15 and the G protein subunit \nbeta 1 (GNB1). GNB1 overexpression effectively reduced the effect of KCNJ15 on \nHippo pathway. Our data demonstrated that KCNJ15, as a novel epigenetic \nsilencing tumor suppressor, regulates cell growth, invasion, and migration by \ninteraction with GNB1 protein mediating the Hippo-YAP signaling pathway during \nchemical-induced lung carcinogenesis and progression. It provides novel insights \ninto epigenetic regulation mechanism during carcinogenesis induced by \nenvironmental pollutants.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

Parent-of-origin effects can lead to \ndifferential disease, and the inability to assign parent of origin in de novo \ncases limits prognostication in the majority of affected individuals with \nretinoblastoma, a hereditary cancer with suspected parent-of-origin \neffects.METHODSTo directly assign parent of origin in patients with \nretinoblastoma, we extracted genomic DNA from blood samples for sequencing using \na programmable, targeted, single-molecule, long-read DNA genomic and epigenomic \napproach. This allowed germline variant calling and simultaneous \nhaplotype-resolved CpG methylation in participants with familial (n = 7) and de \nnovo (n = 9) retinoblastoma.RESULTSTargeted long-read sequencing allowed phasing \ngenomic variation with a differentially methylated region in intron 2 of the \nretinoblastoma gene to confirm parent of origin in known familial samples. This \napproach allowed us to directly assign parent of origin in simple and complex de \nnovo cases from the proband alone. The ability to assign parent of origin in all \nretinoblastoma cases showed that harboring disease-causing variants on the \npaternally inherited allele, whether arising familially or de novo, was \nassociated with more advanced cancer staging at presentation and significantly \ngreater risk of chemotherapy failure (P = 0.002).CONCLUSIONThis study \ndemonstrates the diagnostic potential of multiomic long-read profiling to unveil \nthe parent-of-origin effect in hereditary cancer. The approach in this work will \nbe instrumental in assigning parent of origin to other genetic diseases using \nlocal and distant imprinting signals in the genome.FUNDINGNational Eye \nInstitute, NIH; Gerber Foundation; Research to Prevent Blindness; Angie Karalis \nJohnson Fund; Dawn's Light Foundation; and Mark J.

This highlights the urgent need for a deeper understanding of the molecular \nmechanisms driving NB progression to support the development of new therapeutic \nstrategies. In this study, we demonstrated that the reduced levels of DNAJC12, a \nprotein involved in metabolic regulation, are associated with poor prognosis in \nNB patients. Our data indicate that low DNAJC12 expression activates glycolysis \nin NB cells, leading to increased lactic acid production and histone H4 lysine 5 \nlactylation (H4K5la). Elevated H4K5la upregulates the transcription of COL1A1, a \ngene implicated in cell metastasis. Immunohistochemistry staining of NB patient \nsamples confirmed that high H4K5la levels correlate with poor clinical outcomes. \nFurthermore, we showed that inhibiting glycolysis, reducing H4K5la, or targeting \nCOL1A1 can mitigate the invasive behavior of NB cells. These findings reveal a \ncritical link between metabolic reprogramming and epigenetic modifications in \nthe context of NB progression, suggesting that H4K5la could serve as a novel \ndiagnostic and prognostic marker, and shed light on identifying new therapeutic \ntargets within metabolic pathways for the treatment of this aggressive pediatric \ncancer.\n\n© The Author(s) (2024).

First, we assessed the extent of sex \ndifferential DNAm between cancers and NATs to explore how sex-related DNAm \ndifferences change in cancerous tissues. Next, we employed a multivariate \nadaptive shrinkage approach to model the covariance of cancer-related DNAm \neffects between sexes, aiming to elucidate how sex impacts aberrant DNAm \npatterns in cancers. Finally, we investigated correlations between the methylome \nand transcriptome to identify key signals driving sex-biased DNAm regulation in \ncancers.\nRESULTS: Our analysis revealed a significant attenuation of sex differences in \nDNAm within cancerous tissues compared to baseline differences in normal \ntissues. We identified 3,452 CpGs (Pbonf < 0.05) associated with this reduction, \nwith 72% of the linked genes involved in X chromosome inactivation. Through \ncovariance analysis, we demonstrated that sex differences in cancer are \npredominantly driven by variations in the magnitude of shared DNAm signals, \nreferred to as \"amplification.\" Based on these patterns, we classified cancers \ninto female- and male-biased groups and identified key CpGs exhibiting \nsex-specific amplification. These CpGs were enriched in binding sites of \ncritical transcription factors, including P53, SOX2, and CTCF. Integrative \nmulti-omics analyses uncovered 48 CpG-gene-cancer trios for females and 380 for \nmales, showing similar magnitude differences in DNAm and gene expression, \npointing to a sex-specific regulatory role of DNAm in cancer risk. Notably, \nseveral genes regulated by these trios were previously identified as drug \ntargets for cancers, highlighting their potential as sex-specific therapeutic \ntargets.\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings advance our understanding of how sex, DNAm, and gene \nexpression interact in cancer, offering insights into the development of \nsex-specific biomarkers and precision medicine.\n\nPlain Language Summary: Sex disparities in non-reproductive cancers are \nwell-documented across various aspects, including incidence, survival, \nmortality, and treatment outcomes. A deeper understanding of these differences \ncould support the development of personalized therapeutic strategies. In this \nstudy, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of sex-related DNA methylation \n(DNAm) effects in nine non-reproductive cancers, comparing cancer tissues with \npaired normal adjacent tissues (NATs). Our findings revealed that DNAm \ndifferences between males and females were significantly reduced in cancerous \ntissues. The CpGs associated with this reduction were linked to pathways \ninvolving the tumor microenvironment. Additionally, we found that these sex \ndifferences in cancer were primarily driven by variations in the effect sizes of \nshared DNAm signals, allowing us to classify cancers into male-biased (BLCA, \nTHCA, KIRP, LUAD, and HNSC) and female-biased (LUSC, LIHC, COAD, and KIRC) \ngroups. Notably, we found that differential expression in cancers was correlated \nwith differential methylation in a sex-specific manner, through concordant \nmagnitude differences within each sex. Several of these genes, regulated by DNAm \nchanges, were already targets of cancer drugs (e.g., ECSCR, GATA2, and ERBB3), \nhighlighting the potential for developing sex-specific treatments. Overall, this \nresearch enhances our understanding of the role of DNAm in cancer and could \ncontribute to more personalized therapies for both males and females.\n\n© 2024.

Identifying key methylation-driven genes that affect the \nprognosis of lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) can provide direction for \ntargeted therapy research.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Methylation and RNA-seq data were downloaded from The \nCancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The MethylMix package was used to integrate and \nanalyze the methylation and gene expression data from TCGA, and the LUSC dataset \n(GSE37745) was downloaded from GEO for validation. Forty-five \nDNA-methylation-driven genes (MDGs) were obtained, and 3 genes (TRIM61, SMIM22, \nand ALDH7A1) were significantly associated with survival by using univariate and \nmultivariate Cox regression. A risk model was constructed. KM analysis showed \nthat patients with high-risk scores had poor survival. A nomination plot for \nprognosis prediction of LUSC patients was constructed, which showed a good \npredictive efficiency for tumor prognosis. The high expression of ALDH7A1 was an \nindependent risk factor for poor prognosis in LUSC. The expression of ALDH7A1 in \nLUSC was negatively correlated with its methylation status (COR = -0.655). GSEA \nanalysis showed that high expression of ALDH7A1 could activate multiple \nsignaling pathways (JAK-STAT signaling pathway and mTOR signaling pathway). In \nvitro cell experiments confirmed that in LUSC, silencing ALDH7A1 could inhibit \ntumor progression, while overexpression of ALDH7A1 could promote tumor \nprogression.\nCONCLUSION: Our results indicated that ALDH7A1, a newly discovered MDG in LUSC, \ncould act as an independent prognostic factor for OS in LUSC, with the potential \nto become a potential target for LUSC diagnosis and treatment. High expression \nof ALDH7A1 in LUSC could promote the occurrence and development of tumors. \nSignaling pathways, such as JAK-STAT and mTOR signaling pathways, might regulate \nthe high expression of ALDH7A1.\n\nDOI: 10.1080/07853890.2024.2442529\nPMCID: PMC11703541\nPMID: 39711312 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: No potential conflict of interest was reported \nby the author(s)."

Therefore, this study was aimed to develop a \nmodel that leverages plasma methylation biomarkers and clinical characteristics \nto distinguish between malignant and benign PNs.\nMETHODS: In a training cohort of 210 patients with PNs, we evaluated plasma \ncirculating tumor DNA (ctDNA) for the presence of three lung cancer-specific \nmethylation markers: SHOX2, SCT, and HOXA7. Subsequently, we constructed a \ncombined model utilizing methylated SHOX2/SCT/HOXA7 (mSHOX2/SCT/HOXA7) ctDNA \nlevels, the largest nodule size measured by LDCT, and age, employing the binary \nlogistic regression algorithm. Furthermore, we compared the diagnostic \nperformances of the combined model with the Mayo Clinic model and the single \nmSHOX2/SCT/HOXA7 model by analyzing the area under the receiver operating \ncharacteristic curve (AUC) for each.\nRESULTS: The combined model demonstrated an impressive AUC of 0.87 and an \naccuracy of 0.75 in the training cohort, using pathologic diagnoses as the gold \nstandard. This performance was significantly superior to that of the single \nmSHOX2/SCT/HOXA7 panel (AUC = 0.81, P < 0.0001) and the Mayo model (AUC = 0.65, \nP = 0.0005). Further validation in a cohort of 82 patients with PNs confirmed \nthe diagnostic value of the combined model. Additionally, we observed that as \nthe size of the nodule increased, the diagnostic accuracy of the combined model \nalso improved.\nCONCLUSIONS: A combined model incorporating the ctDNA-based methylation status \nof SHOX2/SCT/HOXA7 genes, the largest nodule size measured by LDCT, and age can \nserve as a supplementary approach to LDCT for lung cancer. This model enhances \nthe precision in identifying high-risk individuals and optimizes the clinical \nmanagement strategies for PNs detected by CT.\n\nCopyright © 2024.

Electronic address: \nLissek@nbio.uni-heidelberg.de.\n\nCancers during oncogenic progression hold information in epigenetic memory which \nallows flexible encoding of malignant phenotypes and more rapid reaction to the \nenvironment when compared to purely mutation-based clonal evolution mechanisms. \nCancer memory describes a proposed mechanism by which complex information such \nas metastasis phenotypes, therapy resistance and interaction patterns with the \ntumor environment might be encoded at multiple levels via mechanisms used in \nmemory formation in the brain and immune system (e.g. single-cell epigenetic \nchanges and distributed state modifications in cellular ensembles). \nCarcinogenesis might hence be the result of physiological multi-level learning \nmechanisms unleashed by defined heritable oncogenic changes which lead to \ntumor-specific loss of goal state integration into the whole organism. The \nformation of cancer memories would create and bind new levels of individuality \nwithin the host organism into the entity we call cancer. Translational \nimplications of cancer memory are that cancers could be engaged at higher \norganizational levels (e.g. be \"trained\" for memory extinction) and that \ncompounds that are known to interfere with memory processes could be \ninvestigated for their potential to block cancer memory formation or recall. It \nalso suggests that diagnostic measures should extend beyond sequencing \napproaches to functional diagnosis of cancer physiology.\n\nCopyright © 2024 The Author. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Electronic \naddress: ines.zidi@istmt.utm.tn.\n\nBACKGROUND: Gastric cancer (GC) remains a serious health concern and is \ncharacterized by a multifactorial etiology involving both genetic and epigenetic \nfactors. The aim of the current study was to examine the relationship between \nHuman leukocyte antigen (HLA)-G 3'UTR polymorphisms and the expression of HLA-G \nin both tumor tissues and plasma samples from patients with GC in the Tunisian \npopulation.\nMETHODS: HLA-G 3'UTR polymorphisms (14pb Insertion/deletion and + 3142C/G) were \nidentified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or Sanger sequencing. Plasma \nlevels of sHLA-G (total sHLA-G, shed HLA-G1 and HLA-G5) were determined. \nImmunohistochemistry was used to evaluate the expression of HLA-G in tumor \ntissues.\nRESULTS: The Del/Del genotype and Del allele frequencies were different between \nGC patients and healthy donors (HD) (OR [95 % CI] = 2.483 [1.070-5.410], \np = 0.025 vs. OR [95 % CI] = 1.537 [0.924-2.584], p = 0.099; respectively). The \nC/C genotype and C allele frequencies were significantly greater in GC patients \nthan in HD (OR [95 % CI] = 2.269[0.1.070-4.904], p = 0.033 vs. OR [95 % \nCI] = 1.746[1.045-2.878], p = 0.034; respectively). Interestingly, the Del/Del \ngenotype and Del allele were significantly associated with an increased risk of \nGC in patients aged ≥55 years at diagnosis. HLA-G was highly expressed in GC \ntissues, particularly in tissues with advanced tumor invasion (T3 + T4). \nCompared with HD, GC patients had higher soluble HLA-G, shed HLA-G1 and HLA-G5 \nlevels (Mann-Whitney: p = 0.001, p = 0.001 and p = 0.643, respectively). \nAssessment of patients' survival by Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that the Del \nallele was significantly associated with reduced overall survival (OS) in GC \npatients at advanced stages III + IV (p = 0.043).\nCONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that HLA-G 3'UTR polymorphisms are associated \nwith GC susceptibility in Tunisian population. The expression of HLA-G in both \nthe tissue and plasma may play an important role in the development and \nprogression of GC. Therefore, the current study supported the recommendation of \ninvestigating HLA-G 3'UTR polymorphisms in GC and indicated that HLA-G molecules \ncould serve as promising therapeutic targets in GC.\n\nCopyright © 2024 The Authors.

DNA methylation and genotyping tests on ASC-US/LSIL samples have \nthe potential to significantly improve the efficiency of screening. In this \nstudy, 12 triage strategies were constructed from FAM19A4/miR124-2 or ASCL1/LHX8 \nmethylation, HPV16/18 or HPV16/18/31/33/45 genotyping and 1-year repeat \ncytology. The performance was evaluated on 215 hrHPV-positive ASC-US/LSIL \nsamples from the IMPROVE trial (NTR5078). Performance was measured by colposcopy \nreferral rate, positive predictive value (PPV) for detecting precancer (CIN3), \nand negative predictive value (NPV). To evaluate efficiency, strategies were \nordered by the cumulative colposcopy referral rate after 1-year cytology and \ncompared by the marginal PPV to detect one additional CIN3 (mPPV). The most \nconservative strategy (referral when HPV16/18 and FAM19A4/miR124 methylation \nresults are positive) had a direct referral rate of 5.2%, a cumulative referral \nrate after 1-year cytology of 54.1%, and mPPV of 19.3%. Replacing HPV16/18 by \nHPV16/18/31/33/45 increased the cumulative 1-year referral rate to 54.6%, and \nyielded an mPPV of 10.0%. Similar results were obtained for strategies with \nASCL1/LHX8 methylation. Of all strategies, referral after an HPV16/18/31/33/45 \npositive, ASCL1/LHX8 methylation-positive, and/or 1-year cytology-positive \nresult yielded the highest direct and cumulative 1-year colposcopy referral \nrates of 64.4% and 79.1%, respectively. The NPVs after 1-year cytology varied \nbetween 98.1% and 99.4%, warranting a return to routine screening. Altogether, \nDNA methylation-based triage strategies are recommended as they are \ndiscriminative for CIN3 and control the number of immediate colposcopy \nreferrals.\n\n© 2024 The Author(s).

Developing a multi-omics-based \nclassification system for LUAD is urgently needed to advance biological \nunderstanding.\nMETHODS: Data on clinical and pathological characteristics, genetic alterations, \nDNA methylation patterns, and the expression of mRNA, lncRNA, and microRNA, \nalong with somatic mutations in LUAD patients, were gathered from the TCGA and \nGEO datasets. A computational workflow was utilized to merge multi-omics data \nfrom LUAD patients through 10 clustering techniques, which were paired with 10 \nmachine learning methods to pinpoint detailed molecular subgroups and refine a \nprognostic risk model. The disparities in somatic mutations, copy number \nalterations, and immune cell infiltration between high- and low-risk groups were \nassessed. The effectiveness of immunotherapy in patients was evaluated through \nthe TIDE and SubMap algorithms, supplemented by data from various immunotherapy \ngroups. Furthermore, the Cancer Therapeutics Response Portal (CTRP) and the \nPRISM Repurposing dataset (PRISM) were employed to investigate new drug \ntreatment approaches for LUAD. In the end, the role of SLC2A1 in tumor dynamics \nwas examined using RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, CCK-8, wound healing, and \ntranswell tests.\nRESULTS: By employing multi-omics clustering, we discovered two unique cancer \nsubtypes (CSs) linked to prognosis, with CS2 demonstrating a better outcome. A \nstrong model made up of 17 genes was created using a random survival forest \n(RSF) method, which turned out to be an independent predictor of overall \nsurvival and showed reliable and impressive performance. The low-risk group not \nonly had a better prognosis but also was more likely to display the \"cold tumor\" \nphenotype. On the other hand, individuals in the high-risk group showed a worse \noutlook and were more likely to respond positively to immunotherapy and six \nparticular chemotherapy medications. Laboratory cell tests demonstrated that \nSLC2A1 is abundantly present in LUAD tissues and cells, greatly enhancing the \nproliferation and movement of LUAD cells.\nCONCLUSIONS: Thorough examination of multi-omics data offers vital understanding \nand improves the molecular categorization of LUAD. Utilizing a powerful machine \nlearning system, we highlight the immense potential of the riskscore in \nproviding individualized risk evaluations and customized treatment suggestions \nfor LUAD patients.\n\nCopyright © 2024 Zhang, Wang and Qian.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2024.1497300\nPMCID: PMC11634853\nPMID: 39669580 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest."

A control group were also recruited (15 male; \n15 female) consisting of age and sex matched volunteered subjects at the \nThoracic Unit of Luigi Vanvitelli University of Naples. The control group and \nlung cancer patients were monitored for anthropometric and biochemical \nparameters before VATS lobectomy. Furthermore, the lung cancer patients were \nalso monitored after 6 months of surgery.\nRESULTS: Body composition is modified after surgery and also albumin and \nC-reactive protein (CRP) serum levels. In the overweight patients in our study, \nadiponectin levels were found to be reduced compared with the control group and \nincreased in the same patients after VATS lobectomy.\nCONCLUSIONS: Tumor removal as well as weight loss could affect adiponectin \nlevels, and thus also a reduction in inflammation. In addition, weight loss \ncould also be due to a psychological condition given by the intervention and not \nto malnutrition related to therapy.\n\n© 2024 The Authors.

Breast cancer \n(BC), an age-associated disease, is associated with older DNAm age and \nepigenetic age acceleration (age accel) at tissue levels. But this raises a \nquestion on the predictability of DNAm age/age accel in BC development, \nemphasizing the importance of studying DNAm age in pre-diagnostic peripheral \nblood (PB) in BC etiology and prevention.\nMETHODS: We included postmenopausal women from the largest study cohort and \nprospectively investigated BC development with their pre-diagnostic DNAm in PB \nleukocytes (PBLs). We estimated Horvath's pan-tissue DNAm age and investigated \nwhether DNAm age/age accel highly correlates with risk for developing \nsubtype-specific BC and to what degree the risk is modified by hormones and \nlifestyle factors.\nRESULTS: DNAm age in PBLs was tightly correlated with age in this age range, and \nolder DNAm age and epigenetic age accel were significantly associated with risk \nfor developing overall BC and luminal subtypes. Of note, in women with bilateral \noophorectomy before natural menopause experiencing shorter lifetime estrogen \nexposure than those with natural menopause, epigenetic age accel substantially \ninfluenced BC development, independent of obesity status and exogeneous estrogen \nuse.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings contribute to better understanding of biologic aging \nprocesses that mediate BC carcinogenesis, detecting a non-invasive epigenetic \naging marker that better reflects BC development, and ultimately identifying the \nelderly with high risk who can benefit from epigenetically targeted preventive \ninterventions.\n\nDOI: 10.18632/aging.206169\nPMCID: PMC11723651\nPMID: 39642870 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: CONFLICTS OF INTEREST: The authors declare that \nthe research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial \nrelationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."

Due to improved breast cancer screening, it now accounts \nfor ~ 25% of all breast cancers. While the treatment success rates are over 90%, \nthis comes at the cost of considerable morbidity, considering that the majority \nof DCIS never become invasive and our understanding of the molecular changes \noccurring in DCIS that predispose to invasive disease is limited. The aim of \nthis study is to characterize molecular changes that occur in DCIS, with the \ngoal of improving DCIS risk stratification.\nMETHODS: We identified and obtained a total of 197 breast tissue samples from 5 \ninstitutions (93 DCIS progressors, 93 DCIS non-progressors, and 11 adjacent \nnormal breast tissues) that had at least 10-year follow-up. We isolated DNA and \nRNA from archival tissue blocks and characterized genome-wide mRNA expression, \nDNA methylation, DNA copy number variation, and RNA splicing variation.\nRESULTS: We obtained all four genomic data sets in 122 of the 197 samples. Our \nintrinsic expression subtype-stratified analyses identified multiple molecular \ndifferences both between DCIS subtypes and between DCIS and IBC. While there was \nheterogeneity in molecular signatures and outcomes within intrinsic subtypes, \nseveral gene sets that differed significantly between progressing and \nnon-progressing DCIS were identified by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis.\nCONCLUSION: DCIS is a molecularly highly heterogenous disease with variable \noutcomes, and the molecular events determining DCIS disease progression remain \npoorly defined. Our genome-wide multi-omic survey documents DCIS-associated \nalterations and reveals molecular heterogeneity within the intrinsic DCIS \nsubtypes. Further studies investigating intrinsic subtype-stratified \ncharacteristics and molecular signatures are needed to determine if these may be \nexploitable for risk assessment and mitigation of DCIS progression. The highly \nsignificant associations of specific gene sets with IBC progression revealed by \nour Gene Set Enrichment Analysis may lend themselves to the development of a \nprognostic molecular score, to be validated on independent DCIS cohorts.\n\n© 2024.

Ageing-associated loss of stemness is posited to suppress \ntumorigenesis3,4, but this hypothesis has not been tested in vivo. Here we use \nphysiologically aged autochthonous genetically engineered5,6 mouse models and \nprimary cells5,6 to demonstrate that ageing suppresses lung cancer initiation \nand progression by degrading the stemness of the alveolar cell of origin. This \nphenotype is underpinned by the ageing-associated induction of the transcription \nfactor NUPR1 and its downstream target lipocalin-2 in the cell of origin in mice \nand humans, which leads to functional iron insufficiency in the aged cells. \nGenetic inactivation of the NUPR1-lipocalin-2 axis or iron supplementation \nrescues stemness and promotes the tumorigenic potential of aged alveolar cells. \nConversely, targeting the NUPR1-lipocalin-2 axis is detrimental to young \nalveolar cells through ferroptosis induction. Ageing-associated DNA \nhypomethylation at specific enhancer sites is associated with increased NUPR1 \nexpression, which is recapitulated in young alveolar cells through DNA \nmethylation inhibition. We uncover that ageing drives functional iron \ninsufficiency that leads to loss of stemness and tumorigenesis but promotes \nresistance to ferroptosis. These findings have implications for the therapeutic \nmodulation of cellular iron homeostasis in regenerative medicine and in cancer \nprevention. Furthermore, our findings are consistent with a model whereby most \nhuman cancers initiate at a young age, thereby highlighting the importance of \ndirecting cancer prevention efforts towards young individuals.\n\n© 2024.

Despite having opposed epigenetic functions, these \nmutations are associated with increased all-cause mortality and a low risk for \nprogression to hematologic neoplasms. Although individual impacts on the \nepigenome have been described using different model systems, the phenotypic \ncomplexity in humans remains to be elucidated. Here, we make use of a natural \ninflammatory response occurring during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), to \nunderstand the association of these mutations with inflammatory morbidity (acute \nrespiratory distress syndrome [ARDS]) and mortality. We demonstrate the \nage-independent, negative impact of DNMT3A mutant (DNMT3Amt) CH on \nCOVID-19-related ARDS and mortality. Using single-cell proteogenomics we show \nthat DNMT3A mutations involve myeloid and lymphoid lineage cells. Using \nsingle-cell multiomics sequencing, we identify cell-specific gene expression \nchanges associated with DNMT3A mutations, along with significant epigenomic \nderegulation affecting enhancer accessibility, resulting in overexpression of \ninterleukin-32 (IL-32), a proinflammatory cytokine that can result in \ninflammasome activation in monocytes and macrophages. Finally, we show with \nsingle-cell resolution that the loss of function of DNMT3A is directly \nassociated with increased chromatin accessibility in mutant cells. Hence, we \ndemonstrate the negative prognostic impact of DNMT3Amt CH on COVID-19-related \nARDS and mortality. DNMT3Amt CH in the context of COVID-19, was associated with \ninflammatory transcriptional priming, resulting in overexpression of IL32. This \noverexpression was secondary to increased chromatic accessibility, specific to \nDNMT3Amt CH cells. DNMT3Amt CH can thus serve as a potential biomarker for \nadverse outcomes in COVID-19.\n\n© 2025 American Society of Hematology. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The median follow-up time was 12.2 \nyears, and the overall GAC incidence rate was 0.82%. Genome-wide mapping of 5hmC \nin gastric premalignant lesions from a subset of individuals was performed using \nthe 5hmC-Seal assay, including 21 samples that progressed to GAC during \nfollow-up and 48 non-progressed age- and sex-matched controls.\nRESULTS: We identified 213 differentially modified gene bodies, primarily \nconcentrated in pathways related to cell division, cell cycle, energy \nmetabolism, inflammation and tumourigenesis. An exploratory study was conducted \nto summarize a 5hmC-based epigenetic model for predicting cancer progression \nusing multivariable logistic regression and machine learning. The nine-gene \nmodel showed an area under the curve of 87.5% (95% confidence interval: \n72%-100%) in the validation samples (one of three), which were set aside before \nmodel training.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to explore the 5hmC molecular landscape in \ngastric premalignant lesions, suggesting relevant pathways implicated in their \nevolution to GAC as well as the feasibility of exploiting genome-wide 5hmC \nmapping in assessing the risk of future cancer progression.\nKEY POINTS: A largest longitudinal follow-up study of gastric precursor lesions \nin Chinese patients.

This study aimed to validate 16 previously reported CpG sites \nthat are independent of smoking yet associated with LC risk within a \npopulation-based prospective cohort. Using the Infinium Methylation EPIC \nBeadChip kit or the Infinium HumanMethylation450K BeadChip Assay, DNA \nmethylation (DNAm) in whole blood was assessed in four subsets (n = 736, 1027, \n997, and 312) of a population-based cohort from Germany. The DNAm levels of the \n16 smoking-independent CpG sites were analyzed. Hazard ratios (HRs) and their \n95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated to assess associations of \nDNAm at the 16 CpG sites with LC risk, adjusting for multiple covariates, \nincluding smoking habits and a smoking-associated DNAm score. Over 17 years of \nfollow-up, a total of 199 LCs were observed. Among the 16 CpGs, cg02211449 \nshowed a negative association with LC risk (HR [95% CI] per SD increase, = 0.70 \n[0.63-0.78]), while cg11385536 (1.04 [1.01-1.07]), cg09736286 (1.64 \n[1.10-2.44]), cg19907023 (1.64 [1.01-2.66]), and cg22032485 (1.52 [1.04-2.21]) \ndisplayed positive associations with LC risk. Five of the 16 suggested \nsmoking-independent CpGs could be externally validated as predictors of LC risk. \nFurther research should address their potential contribution to enhanced LC risk \nstratification.\n\n© 2024 The Author(s).

Colon cancer patients have had surgery, radiation, hormone \ntherapy, and chemotherapy. This study investigates a new experimental method \nusing inexpensive and environmentally friendly Egyptian plant extracts. \nDMSO-dissolved ginger, garlic, cinnamon, and chamomile were employed in this \ninvestigation. HPLC and GC-MS were used to analyze plant extracts. These \nextracts were tested for colon cancer efficacy using various methods. These \nmethods included Caco-2 cells, MTT test, Annexin V-FITC flow cytometry, qRT-PCR, \nand ELISA. Garlic and ginger were found to be cytotoxic to Caco-2 cells. \nCompared to cinnamon and chamomile extracts, garlic and ginger have boosted LDH \nsynthesis significantly. Garlic and ginger also altered autophagy genes \n(Bectin1, Atg5, PTEN) and Caspase-3 expression pathways on proapoptotic \nsignaling. Garlic and ginger increased cleaved PTEN and caspase-3 and decreased \nAtg5 and Bectin1. Ginger and garlic caused extrinsic apoptosis and prevented \nAtg5 and Bectin1 phosphorylation. The average IL-8 and IL-6 levels increased \nsignificantly after 24 hours, according to ELISA. In conclusion, garlic and \nginger extracts modify pro-inflammatory cytokines. Alternative herbal remedies \nlike garlic and ginger may be effective and safe colon cancer treatments.\n\nDOI: 10.31557/APJCP.2024.25.11.3895\nPMCID: PMC11996100\nPMID: 39611913 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The study authors affirm that no conflicts of \ninterest could influence the findings."

The ColonAiQ-positive rate and colonoscopy participation rate \nof the population, detection rate of intestinal lesions, and positive predictive \nvalue (PPV) of CRC and advanced adenoma (AA) were calculated, and the associated \nfactors were explored.\nRESULTS: A total of 105,285 participants were enrolled from January 2021 to \nDecember 2022, all of whom completed the ColonAiQ assay, yielding a positive \nrate of 6.42% (6759/105,285). The colonoscopy compliance rate was 48.56% \n(3282/6759). Intestinal lesions were detected in 1773 individuals (54.02%), \nincluding 63 cases of CRCs (predominately early-stage), 1195 adenomas (441 cases \nof AAs), 327 polyps, and 188 other benign lesions. CRC patients exhibited higher \nColonAiQ scores and more positive loci compared to healthy individuals. The PPVs \nwere 1.92% for CRC and 13.44% for AA. Among participants, 66,121 (62.8%) \ncompleted questionnaires graded by the Asia-Pacific Colorectal Screening score, \nwith 12,139 (18.36%) classified in the high-risk tier. High-risk participants \nhad a higher ColonAiQ-positive rate (11.07%) and PPVs for CRC (3.46%) and AA \n(22.18%). Factors associated with increased detection rates for CRC and AA \nincluded male gender, older age, a history of alcohol consumption, and prior \npolyps.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that ColonAiQ assay effectively identifies \nhigh-risk population.

PAX1m/JAM3m(+) had the highest area under \nthe receiver operating characteristic curve (0.790, 95% CI, 0.747-0.832) in the \nwhole cohort and in women of various ages. PAX1m/JAM3m (+) was detected in all \npatients with cancer (n = 28).

Our \nrecently published study reported that the subset of genes upregulated in ccRCC \ndue to H3K4me1 and DNA demethylation potentially leads to an immunosuppressive \nenvironment. Thus, modulating H3K4me1 chromatin modifier SETD7 with a natural \ninhibitor in combination with immunotherapy might improve the immune landscape \nfor a better therapeutic outcome. The present study was conducted via virtual \nscreening and MD simulation using compounds from the literature, IMPPAT, and \nSuperNatural database. The phytochemical IMPHY002979 showed better binding \naffinity and lower energy than the reported R-PFI-2 and cyproheptadine \ninhibitors. The phytochemicals interact with the SET domain through H-bonding, \nas confirmed by MD simulation and molecular interaction analysis. Further, the \ncompound was assessed using ADME parameters and free energy estimation, showing \nbetter pharmacokinetic properties. Therefore, the non-accessibility of the \nhistone methyltransferase activity domain of SET7 with IMPHY002979 can \ndownregulate H3K4me1 and, thereby, the expression of genes potentially \nresponsible for immunosuppressive TME. Thus, patient stratification based on \nmolecular markers for immunotherapy and combining epigenetic modulators with \ntherapeutic drugs will improve the efficacy of immunotherapy in ccRCC.\n\n© 2024.

Recently, it was shown that physically active individuals exhibit \nslowed epigenetic aging and better age-related outcomes. Here, we investigate \nwhether the extreme intensity of physical activity of Olympic champions still \nhas a beneficial effect on epigenetic aging. To test this hypothesis, we \nexamined the epigenetic aging of 59 Hungarian Olympic champions and of the 332 \ncontrol subjects, 205 were master rowers. We observed that Olympic champions \nexhibit slower epigenetic aging, applying seven state-of-the-art epigenetic \naging clocks. Additionally, male champions who won any medal within the last \n10 years showed slower epigenetic aging compared to other male champions, while \nfemale champions exhibited the opposite trend. We also found that wrestlers had \nhigher age acceleration compared to gymnasts, fencers, and water polo players. \nWe identified the top 20 genes that showed the most remarkable difference in \npromoter methylation between Olympic champions and non-champions. The \nhypo-methylated genes are involved in synaptic health, glycosylation, metal ion \nmembrane transfer, and force generation. Most of the hyper-methylated genes were \nassociated with cancer promotion. The data suggest that rigorous and long-term \nexercise from adolescence to adulthood has beneficial effects on epigenetic \naging.\n\n© 2024.

When their epigenetic repression \nis removed, it can lead to disease, such as autoimmune diseases and cancer. \nCoeliac disease (CeD) is an immune-mediated disease triggered by an abnormal \nT-cell response to dietary gluten and a predisposing condition of small bowel \nadenocarcinoma (SBA), frequently characterized by epigenetic alterations. The \naim of this work was to assess LINE-1 methylation by bisulphite pyrosequencing \nand NanoString® gene transcription analysis in 38 CeD-SBAs compared with 25 SBAs \nassociated with Crohn's disease (CrD-SBAs) and 25 sporadic SBAs (S-SBA). Both \nanalyses were also performed in duodenal mucosae from 12 untreated CeD patients \n(UCD) and 19 treated CeD patients (TCD), and in 11 samples of normal intestinal \nmucosa to better investigate the role of LINE-1 deregulation in CeD and in \nCeD-SBA. A significant loss of LINE-1 methylation was observed in CeD-SBAs and \nin mucosae from UCD patients (with very similar methylation levels) compared \nwith controls. By contrast, a restoration of normal LINE-1 methylation levels \nwas found in TCD mucosae after a strict gluten-free diet. LINE-1 hypomethylation \ndoes not lead to expression of ORF1 and ORF2, with the only exception being for \none CeD-SBA. The expression analysis of enzymes modulating DNA methylation and \ninflammatory genes confirmed that CeD-SBA shared a very similar expression \nprofile of UCD mucosae showing a strong upregulation of genes involved in \ninflammation, immune response, and T-cell activity compared with TCD mucosae. \nFor the first time, this work demonstrates that loss of DNA methylation is an \nintrinsic epigenetic feature of CeD, accompanying the immune response as a \nreversible mechanism in patients following a strict gluten-free diet, and \nsuggests the possible role of LINE-1 hypomethylation in promoting cell \nadaptability during the gliadin-related inflammatory process. © 2024 The \nAuthor(s).

Risk factors include age, \nethnicity, smoking, hygiene, and human papillomavirus infection. Although \ncarcinoma of the penis can be cured in up to 80% of cases if detected early, \nlate diagnosis drastically reduces survival rates, especially in metastatic \ncases. More than 95% of cases are squamous cell carcinomas, and the degree of \ncell differentiation is a key histopathological factor, distinguishing between \npoorly (P), moderately (M), and well-differentiated (W) carcinomas, with \nverrucous carcinoma (V) having the best prognosis due to its low metastatic \ncapacity. This study analyses the differential expression of several biomarkers \nrelated to cell proliferation and cell cycle, inflammation, epigenetics, and \nautophagy (cell cycle (IRS-4, Ki-67, RB1, CDK4, cyclin D1, ERBB2, β-catenin, and \nMAGE-A), inflammation (COX2, NLRP3, and AIF-1), epigenetics (HAT-1) and \nautophagy (ULK-1 and ATG9A) in penile carcinoma according to the degree of \ndifferentiation. Immunohistochemical techniques were performed on 34 penile \nsquamous cell carcinoma (PSCC) samples classified into subtype V (N=6), and \ngroups P (N=9), M (N=9), and W (N=10). The findings suggest a differential \nexpression of molecules according to the degree of cell differentiation, with a \nhigher differential expression of molecules according to the degree of cell \ndifferentiation, suggesting that the proteins studied could have predictive \nvalue. The study highlights the complexity of PSCC and the need for future \nstudies to explore translational applications and search for new biomarkers to \nimprove clinical management and understanding of this disease.\n\n©The Author(s) 2024.

WDFY4 is closely related to asthma and systemic lupus \nerythematosus; however, its role in cancer remains unclear. The purpose of this \nstudy is to use bioinformatics to determine whether abnormal expression of WDFY4 \nis a risk factor for cancer and to preliminarily analyze the ways in which WDFY4 \naffects cancer through experiments. R language packages and bioinformatic \ndatabase were used to mine the potential carcinogenic effect of WDFY4 and \nanalyze the differential WDFY4 expression in cancer, gene mutations, different \ntumor prognoses, immune cell infiltration, tumor microenvironment, and DNA \nmethylation correlation. H1975 and A549 cell lines were infected with \nlentiviruses to overexpress WDFY4, and the effect of WDFY4 on the activity, \nproliferation, apoptosis, and cell cycle of lung cancer cells was analyzed. \nWDFY4 was differentially expressed in human tumors in unpaired and paired \nsamples. The differential expression of WDFY4 in unpaired and paired or protein \nsamples from the Clinical Proteome Tumor Analysis Consortium of eight cancers \nwas consistent. WDFY4 methylation was downregulated in 17 cancer types and \ncaused prognostic differences in different directions in some cancers. WDFY4 \noverexpression significantly inhibited the activity and proliferation of lung \ncancer cell lines, promoted apoptosis, and caused cell cycle arrest. \nDifferential WDFY4 expression in cancers leads to differences in the prognosis \nof various cancers. WDFY4 can be an independent prognostic factor for glioma, \nKIRC, and LUSC.\n\n© 2024 The Author(s).

Poor \noutcomes are primarily associated with patients who have distant metastases. \nUsing the Mammalian Metabolic Enzyme Database, we investigated the \noverexpression of metabolic enzymes in hepatoblastoma tumors compared to \nnoncancerous liver tissue in the GSE131329 transcriptome dataset. For the \noverexpressed enzymes, we applied ElasticNet machine learning to assess their \npredictive value for metastasis. A metabolic expression score was then computed \nfrom the significant enzymes and integrated into a clinical-biological logistic \nregression model. Forty-one overexpressed enzymes distinguished hepatoblastoma \ntumors from noncancerous liver tissues. Eighteen of these enzymes predicted \nmetastasis status with an AUC of 0.90, demonstrating 85.7% sensitivity and 92.3% \nspecificity. ElasticNet machine learning identified DNMT3B and PFKFB4 as key \npredictors of metastasis. Univariate analyses confirmed the significance of \nthese enzymes, with respective p-values of 0.0058 and 0.0091. A metabolic score \nbased on DNMT3B and PFKFB4 expression discriminated metastasis status and \nhigh-risk CHIC scores (p-value = 0.005). The metabolic score was more sensitive \nthan the C1/C2 classifier in predicting metastasis (accuracy: 0.72 vs. 0.55). In \na regression model integrating the metabolic score with epidemiological \nparameters (gender, age at diagnosis, histological type, and clinical PRETEXT \nstage), the metabolic score was confirmed as an independent adverse predictor of \nmetastasis (p-value = 0.003, odds ratio: 2.12). This study identified the dual \noverexpression of PFKFB4 and DNMT3B in hepatoblastoma patients at risk of \nmetastasis (high-risk CHIC classification). The combined tumor expression of \nDNMT3B and PFKFB4 was used to compute a metabolic score, which was validated as \nan independent predictor of metastatic status in hepatoblastoma.\n\nDOI: 10.3390/biom14111394\nPMCID: PMC11591731\nPMID: 39595571 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare no conflicts of interest."

By leveraging multi-omics and epidemiological \ninformation, we can unveil relationships between carcinogenesis processes that \nwould otherwise remain hidden. Our integrative analysis of DNA methylome, \ntranscriptome, and somatic mutation profiles of kidney tumours linked ageing, \nepithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and xenobiotic metabolism to kidney \ncarcinogenesis. Ageing process was represented by associations with cellular \nmitotic clocks such as epiTOC2, SBS1, telomere length, and PBRM1 and SETD2 \nmutations, which ticked faster as tumours progressed. We identified a \nrelationship between BAP1 driver mutations and the epigenetic upregulation of \nEMT genes (IL20RB and WT1), correlating with increased tumour immune \ninfiltration, advanced stage, and poorer patient survival. We also observed an \ninteraction between epigenetic silencing of the xenobiotic metabolism gene GSTP1 \nand tobacco use, suggesting a link to genotoxic effects and impaired xenobiotic \nmetabolism. Our pan-cancer analysis showed these relationships in other tumour \ntypes. Our study enhances the understanding of kidney carcinogenesis and its \nrelation to risk factors and progression, with implications for other tumour \ntypes.\n\n© 2024.

One proposed mechanism is that \ntransportation noise disrupts sleep and the circadian rhythm. We investigated \nthe relationships between road traffic noise, DNA methylation in circadian \nrhythm genes, and breast cancer. We selected 610 female participants (318 breast \ncancer cases and 292 controls) enrolled into the Malmö, Diet, and Cancer cohort. \nDNA methylation of CpGs (N = 29) in regulatory regions of circadian rhythm genes \n(CRY1, BMAL1, CLOCK, and PER1) was assessed by pyrosequencing of DNA from \nlymphocytes collected at enrollment. To assess associations between modeled \n5-year mean residential road traffic noise and differentially methylated CpG \npositions, we used linear regression models adjusting for potential confounders, \nincluding sociodemographics, shiftwork, and air pollution. Linear mixed effects \nmodels were used to evaluate road traffic noise and differentially methylated \nregions. Unconditional logistic regression was used to investigate CpG \nmethylation and breast cancer.\nRESULTS: We found that higher mean road traffic noise was associated with lower \nDNA methylation of three CRY1 CpGs (CpG1, CpG2, and CpG12) and three BMAL1 CpGs \n(CpG2, CpG6, and CpG7). Road traffic noise was also associated with differential \nmethylation of CRY1 and BMAL1 promoters. In CRY1 CpG2 and CpG5 and in CLOCK \nCpG1, increasing levels of methylation tended to be associated with lower odds \nof breast cancer, with odds ratios (OR) of 0.88 (95% confidence interval (CI) \n0.76-1.02), 0.84 (95% CI 0.74-0.96), and 0.80 (95% CI 0.68-0.94), respectively.\nCONCLUSIONS: In summary, our data suggest that DNA hypomethylation in CRY1 and \nBMAL1 could be part of a causal chain from road traffic noise to breast cancer. \nThis is consistent with the hypothesis that disruption of the circadian rhythm, \ne.g., from road traffic noise exposure, increases the risk of breast cancer. \nSince no prior studies have explored this association, it is essential to \nreplicate our results.\n\n© 2024.

Aged epithelial cells exhibit epigenetic \nand transcriptional changes in metabolic, pro-inflammatory and cancer-associated \ngenes. Aged stromal cells downregulate fibroblast marker genes and upregulate \nmarkers of senescence and cancer-associated fibroblasts. Among immune cells, \ndistinct T cell subsets (Gzmk+, memory CD4+, γδ) and M2-like macrophages expand \nwith age. Spatial transcriptomics reveals co-localization of aged immune and \nepithelial cells in situ. Lastly, we found transcriptional signatures of aging \nmammary cells in human breast tumors, suggesting possible links between aging \nand cancer. Together, these data uncover that epithelial, immune and stromal \ncells shift in proportions and cell identity, potentially impacting cell \nplasticity, aged microenvironment and neoplasia risk.\n\n© 2024.

Analysis of 16S rRNA-Seq \ndata showed significant differences in bacterial abundance between BC and \nhealthy groups and identified 26 differential genera with the threshold values \nat |log2FC|>2.0 and p-value≤0.05. It was observed that two genera Prevotella and \nAnaerovibria are significantly upregulated in BC patients and others are \ndownregulated. Functional analysis based on all differential genera identified \n19 MetaCyc signaling pathways, twelve of which were significantly enriched in BC \npatients by containing 165 genes Top-ranked 10 genes mdh, pykF, gapA, zwf, pgi, \ntpiA, pgk, pfkA, ppsA, and pykA were identified as BC-causing bacterial key \ngenes (bKGs) through protein-protein interaction network analysis. Subsequently, \nthe bKG-guided top ranked 10 drug molecules Digitoxin, Digoxin, Ledipasvir, \nSuramin, Ergotamine, Venetoclax, Nilotinib, Conivaptan, Dihydroergotamine, and \nElbasvir were identified using molecular docking analysis. The stability of \ntop-ranked three drug-target complexes (Digitoxin-pykA, Digoxin-mdh, and \nLedipasvir-pgi) were confirmed through the molecular dynamics simulation \nstudies. Therefore, these findings might be useful resources to the wet-lab \nresearchers for further experimental validation on bacterial therapies against \nBC.\n\nCopyright: © 2024 Kibria et al.

This study aims to \ninvestigate the prevalence of factor V Leiden (G1691A), factor II prothrombin \n(G20210A), and MTHFR (C677T and A1298C) polymorphisms in a Greek population, \nevaluating not only their association with thrombophilia, but also broader \nhealth implications.\nMETHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study involving one hundred apparently \nhealthy adults from Thessaloniki, Greece. After obtaining informed consent, DNA \nwas isolated and analyzed using real-time PCR to detect the frequencies of the \naforementioned polymorphisms.\nRESULTS: The genetic distribution of the examined polymorphisms aligns closely \nwith that observed in Northern Europe. Factor V Leiden (FVL) and prothrombin \nG20210A mutations were predominantly wild types, with a small percentage showing \nheterozygous mutations. The MTHFR C677T and A1298C polymorphisms showed a higher \nvariation in allele frequency. Certain lifestyle factors such as smoking and \nhigh body mass index were significantly associated with the occurrence of \ncombined MTHFR genotypes, suggesting an interaction between genetic and \nenvironmental risk factors. Family cancer and cardiovascular history was \nsignificantly associated with combined FVL and prothrombin G20210A and MTHFR \npolymorphism heterozygous carriers.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that these genetic polymorphisms are not only \npivotal in understanding thrombophilia but also have broader implications for \ncardiovascular disease and cancer.

We hypothesize that \nbiological age (B-age) acceleration is involved in this association. Our study \naims to examine B-age as a novel contributing factor to cancer development \npost-CVE.\nMETHODS: From our prospective stroke registry (BasicMar), we selected 940 cases \nwith epigenetic data. For this study, we specifically analyzed 648 of these \npatients who had available data, no prior history of cancer, and a minimum \nfollow-up of 3 months. The primary outcome was cancer incidence. B-age was \nestimated using DNA methylation data derived from whole blood samples obtained \nwithin 24 h of stroke onset, employing various epigenetic clocks (including \nHannum, Horvath, PhenoAge, ZhangBLUP, ZhangEN, and the mitotic epiTOC). \nExtrinsic epigenetic age acceleration (EEAA) was calculated as the residuals \nfrom the regression of B-age against chronological age (C-age). For epiTOC, the \nage-adjusted values were obtained by regressing out the effect of age from the \nraw epiTOC measurements. Estimated white cell counts were derived from DNA \nmethylation data, and these cell fractions were used to compute the intrinsic \nepigenetic age acceleration (IEAA). Subsequently, we evaluated the independent \nassociation between EEAA, IEAA, and cancer incidence while controlling for \npotential confounding variables.\nRESULTS: Among 648 patients with a median follow-up of 8.15 years, 83 (12.8%) \ndeveloped cancer. Cox multivariable analyses indicated significant associations \nbetween Hannum, Zhang, and epiTOC EEAA and the risk of cancer after CVE. After \nadjusting for multiple testing and competing risks, EEAA measured by Hannum \nclock maintained an independent association with cancer risk. Specifically, for \neach year increase in Hannum's EEAA, we observed a 6.0% increased incidence of \ncancer (HR 1.06 [1.02-1.10], p value = 0.002).\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that epigenetic accelerated aging, as \nindicated by Hannum's EEAA, may play a significant role in the increased cancer \nrisk observed in CVE survivors.\n\n© 2024.

Electronic address: \nludongdong@tongji.edu.cn.\n\nBACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: LUC7L2 may be involved in the recognition of \nnon-consensus splice donor sites in association with the U1 snRNP spliceosomal \nsubunit. However, their detailed features and regulatory mechanisms of LUC7L2 in \nthe development of human liver cancer have not been well characterized.\nRESULTS: Herein, our results demonstrate that LUC7L2 promotes the proliferation \nof liver cancer cells in vitro and xenograft transplantation in vivo. The \nproliferation ability was significantly increased in the rLV-LUC7L2 group \ncompared to rLV group (24th hour: P = 0.00043; 48th hour: P = 0.000017). The \ncellular colony formation ability was significantly increased in the rLV-LUC7L2 \ngroup compared to rLV group (25.18±6.94 % vs 67.63±9.57 %, P = 0.00009). The \nweight of transplanted tumors was significantly increased in the rLV-LUC7L2 \ngroup compared to rLV group (0.387±0.074 vs 0.958± 0.103 g, P = 0.00004). \nMoreover, LUC7L2 effects on epigenetic regulation based on H3K4me3 in human \nliver cancer cells. e,g, RRAS. Furthermore, LUC7L2 affects transcriptome and \nproteome in liver cancer. In particular, LUC7L2 enhances the modification \nability of H3K4me3and RNAPolII on the promoter region of RRAS and then enhances \nthe expression of RRAS in liver cancer. Strikingly, LUC7L2 increases the \nincreases the DNA damage repair ability dependent on RRAS. Although the DNA \ndamage repair ability was significantly increased in the rLV-LUC7L2 group \ncompared to rLV group(1.868±0.181 vs 0.17±0.034, P = 0.0000022), it was not \nsignificantly changed in rLV-LUC7L2+rLV-shRNA RRAS group compared with rLV \ngroup(1.868±0.181 vs 1.798±0.313, P = 0.317). Importantly, LUC7L2 enhances the \ncarcinogenic function dependent on RRAS. In particular, RRAS increased the DNA \ndamage repair ability by enhancing the formation of DNA damage repair dependent \non tri-methylation of histone H3 lysine 36 (H3K36me3).\nCONCLUSIONS: It is implied that LUC7L2's role in liver cancer proliferation is \nlargely dependent on RRAS. The first discovery provides a basis for the \nprevention and treatment of human liver cancer.\n\nCopyright © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

Is this dietary pattern \nassociated with various subjective and objective lung health phenotypes? Does \nthis relationship vary among people who currently smoke vs previously smoked?\nSTUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Using the Lovelace Smoker Cohort (LSC), we employed \nthe least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regularized Poisson \nregression to define a dietary pattern for sputum. Associations of the dietary \npattern with objective and subjective lung health measurements were examined \nusing generalized linear and Cox models in the LSC and the Prostate, Lung, \nColorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening trial.\nRESULTS: The Dietary Pattern for Healthy Lung (DiPHeaL) includes low consumption \nof processed meat, and high consumption of dark green vegetables, tea, alcohol, \nand fruit juice. In the LSC, a higher DiPHeaL score (1 SD) was associated with \nbetter FEV1 (by 96.1 mL/s), FEV1/FVC ratio (by 1.83%), and respiratory quality \nof life (by 4.9 for activity score), and decreased cardiopulmonary mortality (by \n47%) in participants who previously smoked (all P values < .05), but not in \nparticipants who currently smoke. Moreover, effect sizes of the DiPHeaL score on \nrespiratory quality of life measures were greater among participants who \npreviously smoked with airway obstruction compared with those without. \nAssociations with cardiovascular and respiratory mortality were replicated in \nPLCO participants who previously smoked . A higher DiPHeaL score was also \nassociated with lower lung cancer incidence in participants who previously \nsmoked, as well as reduced COPD incidence and lung cancer mortality regardless \nof smoking status in the PLCO.\nINTERPRETATION: We defined a novel dietary pattern for lung epigenetic aging, \nwhich linked to lung health measurements. Participants who previously smoked, \nespecially those with airway obstruction, may benefit the most from nutritional \nmodification.\n\nCopyright © 2024 American College of Chest Physicians.

However, their precise involvement in colon \nneoplasia and colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) remains incompletely understood. Here, \nwe conducted a comprehensive investigation utilizing multiple databases to \nexplore the multifaceted characteristics of eFGFs. Through integrated analyses \nof diverse databases, including TIMER2.0, UALCAN, OncoDB, cBioPortal, \nLinkedOmics, STRING, htfTarget, mirTarBase, circBank, and DGIdb, we explored \neFGFs' gene expression, DNA methylation, prognostic significance, genetic \nalterations, gene regulatory networks, functional analysis, and drug \ninteractions in COAD patients. Our findings revealed elevated expression levels \nof eFGFs in COAD, with aberrant gene expression potentially linked to promoter \nmethylation. Importantly, hypermethylation of FGF21 and FGF23 and downregulation \nof FGF23 correlated with poor survival outcomes in COAD patients. Functional \nanalyses highlighted the involvement of eFGF genes in Ras signaling, PI3K-Akt \nsignaling, and cancer pathways. Furthermore, we validated our findings through a \ncross-sectional study by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction \n(qRT-PCR), confirming significant overexpression of FGF21 in colon polyps \ncompared to normal mucosa. Additionally, we observed elevated RNA expression of \nFGF21 and FGF23 in adenomatous polyps compared to hyperplastic polyps. This \nstudy sheds new light on the critical roles of eFGFs in COAD tumorigenesis and \nunderscores their potential as promising prognostic markers for COAD, as well as \ndiscriminative markers for distinguishing high-risk from low-risk polyps. These \nfindings provide valuable insights into the complex molecular mechanisms \nunderlying colorectal neoplasia and offer potential avenues for targeted \ntherapeutic strategies.\n\n© 2024.

Given the poor prognosis, early \ndetection of at-risk individuals is crucial. Genetic factors, particularly \nsingle nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in metabolic genes, may influence OC \nsusceptibility. This study investigated the association between SNPs in CYP1A1, \nCOX2, SOD2, and HIF1a genes and OC risk in the Pakistani population.\nMETHODS: A prospective study was conducted from October 2019 to March 2022, \nenrolling 215 newly diagnosed OC patients and 410 controls. Genetic variations \nwere analyzed using High-Resolution Melting (HRM) analysis and Sanger \nsequencing, with protein expression evaluated by ELISA.\nRESULTS: No significant associations were found between the studied SNPs and OC \nrisk. However, a non-significant trend was observed for the SOD2 variant \n(rs4880), where the G allele was associated with a higher OC risk than the A \nallele (p = 0.20). Elevated COX2 and HIF1α levels (p-values of 0.014 and \n< 0.001, respectively) and reduced SOD2 levels (p < 0.0001) were observed in OC \npatients, while CYP1A1 levels remained similar in both controls and cases.\nCONCLUSION: Although SNPs in CYP1A1, COX2, SOD2, and HIF1α were not \nsignificantly associated with OC risk in the Pakistani population, altered \nprotein expression levels of COX2, HIF1α and SOD2 suggest additional regulatory \nmechanisms. Further investigation into post-transcriptional modifications and \nepigenetic factors could lead to novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets for OC \nin Pakistan.\n\n© 2024.

Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most common \nand aggressive type of lung cancer with dismal prognosis and prognostic \nstratification would help to guide treatment. Aberrant DNA methylation in tumors \noccurs earlier than clinical variations, and keeps accumulating as cancer \nprogresses. Preliminary studies have given us some clues that DNA methylation \nmight serve as a promising biomarker for prognosis prediction. Herein, we aimed \nto study the potential utility of DNA methylation pattern in predicting the \nrecurrence risk of early stage resectable LUAD and to develop a risk-modeling \nsignature based on differentially methylated regions (DMRs). This study \nconsisted of three cohorts of 244 patients with stage I-IIIA LUAD, including \nmarker discovery cohort (n = 39), prognostic model training cohort (n = 117) and \nvalidation cohort (n = 80). 468 DMRs between LUAD tumor and adjacent tissues \nwere screened out in the marker discovery cohort (adjusted P < 0.05), and a \nprognostic signature was developed based on 15 DMRs significantly related to \ndisease-free survival in early stage LUAD patients. The DMR signature showed \ncommendable performance in predicting the recurrence risk of LUAD patients both \nin model training cohort (P < 0.001; HR = 4.32, 95% CI = 2.39-7.80) and model \nvalidation cohort (P = 0.009; HR = 9.08, 95% CI = 1.20-68.80), which might be of \ngreat utility both for understanding the molecular basis of LUAD relapse, \nproviding risk stratification of patients, and establishing future monitoring \nplans.\n\nDOI: 10.18632/aging.206139\nPMCID: PMC11719112\nPMID: 39560475 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: CONFLICTS OF INTEREST: The authors declare that \nthe research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial \nrelationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."

However, assessing the impact of environmental factors, such as \nlifestyle, health-related behavior, or external exposures, is still challenging. \nDNA methylation (DNAm), capturing both genetic and environmental effects, \npresents a promising opportunity. Previous studies have identified associations \nand predicted the risk of BC using DNAm in blood; however, these studies did not \ndistinguish between genetic and environmental contributions to these DNAm sites. \nIn this study, associations between DNAm and BC are assessed using paired twin \nmodels, which control for shared genetic and environmental effects, allowing \ntesting for associations between DNAm and non-shared environmental exposures and \nbehavior.\nRESULTS: Pre-diagnosis blood samples of 32 monozygotic (MZ) and 76 dizygotic \n(DZ) female twin pairs discordant for BC were collected at the mean age of 56.0 \nyears, with the mean age at diagnosis 66.8 years and censoring 75.2 years. We \nidentified 212 CpGs (p < 6.4*10-8) and 15 DMRs associated with BC risk across \nall pairs using paired Cox proportional hazard models. All but one of the BC \nrisks associated with CpGs were hypomethylated, and 198/212 CpGs had their DNAm \nassociated with BC risk independent of genetic effects. According to previous \nliterature, at least five of the top CpGs were related to estrogen signaling. \nFollowing a comprehensive two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis, we found \nevidence supporting a dual causal impact of DNAm at cg20145695 (gene body of \nNXN, rs480351) with increased risk for estrogen receptor positive BC and \ndecreased risk for estrogen receptor negative BC.\nCONCLUSION: While causal effects of DNAm on BC risk are rare, most of the \nidentified CpGs associated with the risk of BC appear to be independent of \ngenetic effects. This suggests that DNAm could serve as a valuable biomarker for \nenvironmental risk factors for BC, and may offer potential benefits as a \ncomplementary tool to current risk assessment procedures.\n\n© 2024.

Lamina-Associated Domains (LADs) are \nregions of heterochromatin associated with the nuclear envelope and the nuclear \nlamina, a protein network involved in both nuclear organization and genome \nstructure. LADs are developmentally regulated, and their dysregulation is \nassociated with several diseases and pathological states, including cancer and \npremature aging. In addition to LADs, other nuclear protein compartments appear \nto scaffold or support unique chromatin environments to affect gene expression. \nThese revelations carry profound implications for our comprehension of \ndevelopmental processes and the pathogenesis of various diseases, especially \ngiven the numerous disorders already directly associated with, for example, \nmutations in lamin and INM proteins. This spatial compartmentalization of \nchromatin subtypes to unique protein compartments has led to the adoption of \nproximity-labeling methods, such as DamID (DNA Adenine Methyltransferase \nIdentification), to identify these unique chromatin compartments.\n\n© 2025.

Using a new \ngenetically engineered mouse model of germline Brca1 heterozygosity, we \ndemonstrate that early tumor onset in a Brca1 heterozygous background cannot be \nfully explained by the conventional 'two-hit' hypothesis, suggesting the \nexistence of inherent tumor-promoting alterations in the Brca1 heterozygous \nstate. Single-cell RNA sequencing and assay for transposase-accessible chromatin \nwith sequencing analyses uncover a unique set of differentially accessible \nchromatin regions in ostensibly normal Brca1 heterozygous mammary epithelial \ncells, distinct from wild-type cells and partially mimicking the chromatin and \nRNA-level changes in tumor cells. Transcription factor analyses identify loss of \nELF5 and gain of AP-1 sites in these epigenetically primed regions; in vivo \nexperiments further implicate AP-1 and Wnt10a as strong promoters of \nBrca1-related breast cancer. These findings reveal a previously unappreciated \nepigenetic effect of Brca1 haploinsufficiency in accelerating tumorigenesis, \nadvancing our mechanistic understanding and informing potential therapeutic \nstrategies.\n\n© 2024.

It is paramount for AML risk stratification \nand identification of molecular therapeutic targets. Most NGS feasibility and \nresults data are derived from controlled clinical intervention trials (CCIT). We \naimed to validate these data in a real-world setting.\nPATIENTS, MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study retrospectively analyzed 447 AML \npatients treated at an Austrian tertiary cancer care center. A total of 284 out \nof the 447 cases were treated between 2013-2023 when NGS was locally available \nfor the clinical routine.\nRESULTS: The NGS was successfully performed from bone marrow biopsies and \naspirates, with processing times decreasing from 22 days in 2013/2014 to 10 days \nin 2022. Molecular therapeutic target(s) were identified by NGS in 107/284 (38%) \ncases and enabled risk stratification in 10 cases where conventional karyotyping \nfailed. Concerning molecular landscape, TET2 (27%), FLT3 (25%), DNMT3A (23%), \nand NPM1 (23%) were most frequently mutated. Comparing older and younger \npatients (cut-off 70 years) showed enrichment in older people for mutations \naffecting DNA methylation (72% vs. 45%; P < 0.001) and the spliceosome (28% vs. \n11%; P = 0.006) and more cellular signaling mutations in younger patients (61% \nvs. 46%; P = 0.022). Treatment outcomes corroborated a significant survival \nbenefit in the recent NGS era and patients treated with novel/molecularly \ntargeted drugs. Ultimately, biospecimens of these patients are stored within \na leukemia biobank, generating a valuable tool for translational science.\nCONCLUSION: Our study validates data from CCIT and supports their relevance for \ntreatment decisions in a real-world setting. Moreover, they demonstrate the \nfeasibility and benefits of NGS within a routine clinical setting.\n\n© 2024.

We explore the ability of \nmethylation profiling to distinguish primary melanoma methylation classes and \ntheir associations with clinicopathologic characteristics and survival.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: InterMEL is a retrospective case-control study that \nassembled primary cutaneous melanomas from American Joint Committee on Cancer \n(AJCC) 8th edition stage II and III patients diagnosed between 1998 and 2015 in \nthe United States and Australia. Cases are patients who died of melanoma within \n5 years from original diagnosis. Controls survived longer than 5 years without \nevidence of melanoma recurrence or relapse. Methylation classes, distinguished \nby consensus clustering of 850K methylation data, were evaluated for their \nclinicopathologic characteristics, 5-year survival status, and differentially \nmethylated gene sets.\nRESULTS: Among 422 InterMEL melanomas, consensus clustering revealed three \nprimary melanoma methylation classes (MethylClasses): a CpG island methylator \nphenotype (CIMP) class, an intermediate methylation (IM) class, and a low \nmethylation (LM) class. CIMP and IM were associated with higher AJCC stage (both \nP = .002), Breslow thickness (CIMP P = .002; IM P = .006), and mitotic index \n(both P < .001) compared with LM, while IM had higher N stage than CIMP (P = \n.01) and LM (P = .007). CIMP and IM had a 2-fold higher likelihood of 5-year \ndeath from melanoma than LM (CIMP odds ratio [OR], 2.16 [95% CI, 1.18 to 3.96]; \nIM OR, 2.00 [95% CI, 1.12 to 3.58]) in a multivariable model adjusted for age, \nsex, log Breslow thickness, ulceration, mitotic index, and N stage. Despite more \nextensive CpG island hypermethylation in CIMP, CIMP and IM shared similar \npatterns of differential methylation and gene set enrichment compared with LM.\nCONCLUSION: Melanoma MethylClasses may provide clinical value in predicting \n5-year death from melanoma among patients with primary melanoma independent of \nother clinicopathologic factors.\n\nDOI: 10.1200/PO-24-00375\nPMCID: PMC11737429\nPMID: 39509669 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: AUTHORS’ DISCLOSURES OF POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF \nINTEREST RAS has received fees for professional services from SkylineDx BV, IO \nBiotech ApS, etaOptima Technology Inc., F.

Compelling \nevidence shows that microbial community composition is associated with \ncarcinogenesis, suggesting that the microbiome may play a role in cancer \ndevelopment of smokers. We previously showed that black raspberry (BRB) protects \nagainst OSCC induced by the tobacco constituent dibenzo[def,p]chrysene (DBP) via \nalteration of genetic and epigenetic markers in a manner consistent with its \ncancer preventive activity. In the present study, we conducted a mouse \nexperiment to investigate the effects of BRB and DBP individually and in \ncombination on the oral and gut microbiota. DBP-induced DNA damage in the mouse \noral cavity is an essential step for the development of OSCC in mice. 16S rRNA \ngene sequencing revealed that BRB significantly increased microbial diversity \nand shifted microbiome composition in the gut and oral cavity, whereas DBP had \nno significant effect. In both gut and oral microbiota, Akkermansia muciniphila \nwas significantly reduced after BRB treatment; however, this was not consistent \nwith pure culture in vitro assays suggesting that the impact of BRB on A. \nmuciniphila may be mediated through indirect mechanisms including the host or \nother microbes. Indeed BRB, but not DBP, was found to modulate the growth \nkinetics of human gut microbes in vitro including lactic acid bacteria and \nBacteroides spp. The results of the current study further emphasize the \ninterplay of microbiome and environmental factors in the development and \nprevention of OSCC.

However, cytology relies on the subjective judgment of \npathologists, leading to inconsistent clinical performance.\nMETHODS: A total of 657 hrHPV-positive women aged 25-64 years were enrolled in \nthis cross-sectional study. All participants underwent colposcopic biopsy after \ncytology triage, with cytology residual specimens undergoing DNA methylation \ntesting. CIN2+ and CIN3+ sensitivity and specificity were compared between the \ndifferent triage strategies (n=487): PAX1 methylation (PAX1m) , Glycophorin C \nmethylation (GYPCm), cytology, and combinations between them or with HPV16/18.\nRESULTS: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) for \nPAX1m and GYPCm in detecting CIN2 or worse (CIN2+) were 0.867 (95% confidence \ninterval [CI]: 0.796-0.937) and 0.873 (95% CI: 0.808-0.938), respectively. The \nsensitivities of PAX1m and GYPCm were consistent with those of cytology for both \nCIN2+ and CIN3+ detection. The relative specificities of PAX1m and GYPCm for \nCIN2+ detection compared to cytology were 2.83 (95% CI: 2.33-2.45) and 3.09 (95% \nCI: 2.40-3.98), respectively. The relative specificities of combining HPV 16/18 \nwith PAX1m and GYPCm for CIN2+ detection compared to cytology were 3.38 (95% CI: \n2.96-3.86) and 3.67 (95% CI: 3.15-4.27), respectively. Compared to low levels of \nDNA methylation, high levels of PAX1m and GYPCm resulted in odd ratios (ORs) of \n57.66 (95% CI: 13.57-409.12, p < 0.001) and 23.87 (95% CI: 6.49-115.42, p < \n0.001) for CIN3+, adjusted for HPV 16/18 and cytology results.\nCONCLUSIONS: PAX1m and GYPCm demonstrated superior ability to identify cervical \nprecancerous lesions and cervical cancer, with AUC values exceeding 0.85. For \ndetecting CIN2+/CIN3+ in women with hrHPV-positive status, DNA methylation \n(combined with HPV 16/18) showed higher specificity than cytology (combined with \nHPV 16/18) and is a potential molecular biomarker for detecting cervical \n(pre)cancer.\n\n© 2024.

Epigenetic modifications, \npredominantly characterized by alterations in DNA methylation patterns, have \nbeen linked to a diverse array of neoplastic processes. Here, we undertake a \ncomprehensive analysis of the DNA methylation signature in GC, with the aim to \ndiscover the potential diagnostic epigenetic biomarkers. Utilizing the Illumina \n935 K BeadChip, we conducted a genome-wide exploration of DNA methylation \npatterns in four paired samples of GC tissues and adjacent non-cancerous \ncounterparts. The bisulfite-pyrosequencing (n = 7) was employed to the \nquantification for methylated gene. The pubic databases including GWAS Catalog, \nTCGA and GEO were used. The immunohistochemistry and qRT-PCR analysis were \nperformed. In contrast to adjacent tissues, GC tissues manifested pronounced \nhypermethylation patterns specifically within the promoter \ncytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) islands, indicating localized epigenetic \nalterations. DNA methylome analysis further revealed 4432 \ndifferentially-methylated probes (DMPs), with the gene PRKCB exhibited the most \nprominent average DNA methylation disparity (mean Δβ = 0.353). Pyrosequencing \nvalidation confirmed three DMPs within the PRKCB promoter (cg08406370, \ncg00735962, and cg18526361). Notably, the mean methylation levels of PRKCB were \ninversely correlated with mRNA expression levels in the GWAS Catalog. \nFurthermore, both mRNA and protein expression levels of PRKCB were significantly \nreduced in GCs when compared to their adjacent non-cancerous counterparts, \nverified by TCGA and GEO database. Our study reveals significant DNA methylation \nalterations in GC and emphasizes the pivotal role of PRKCB gene hypermethylation \nin conferring GC risk, which offers fresh perspectives for advancing diagnostic \napproaches and therapeutic strategies for GC.\n\n© 2024.

Colorectal cancers (CRC) are linked to abnormal \nactivation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, whose key feature is the nuclear \naccumulation of acetylated β-catenin in colon epithelial cells. Nuclear \nβ-catenin acts as a transcriptional co-activator, targeting genes involved in \ncell proliferation and invasion. 1α,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3 or \ncalcitriol), the active form of vitamin D, antagonizes Wnt/β-catenin \nover-activation by engaging its high affinity receptor, VDR. Here we unveil that \n1,25(OH)2D3-bound VDR activates Silent Information Regulator of Transcription, \nsirtuin 1 (SIRT1), leading to β-catenin deacetylation and nuclear exclusion, \ndownregulation of its pro-tumourigenic target genes and inhibition of human \ncolon carcinoma cell proliferation. Notably, orthogonal SIRT1 activation mimics \nnuclear exclusion of β-catenin while SIRT1 inhibition blocks the effects of \n1,25(OH)2D3. Thus, SIRT1 emerges as a crucial mediator in the protective action \nof vitamin D against CRC. The mutual negative feedback loop unveiled here \nbetween Wnt and SIRT1 represents an important surrogate target in CRC. Since \nnuclear localisation of β-catenin is a critical driver of CRC that requires its \nacetylation, we provide a mechanistic foundation for the epidemiological \nevidence linking vitamin D deficiency and increased CRC risk and mortality.\n\n© The author(s).\n\nDOI: 10.7150/ijbs.95875\nPMCID: PMC11528448\nPMID: 39494323 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: Competing Interests: The authors have declared \nthat no competing interest exists."

The purpose of this \nstudy is to explore the impact of membrane palmitoylated protein (MPP2) on the \nprognosis of colorectal cancer patients. We obtained transcriptome data and DNA \nmethylation data of 380 colorectal cancer patients from the Cancer Genome Atlas \n(TCGA). Then we used a series of bioinformatics analysis methods to reveal the \nrelationship between MPP2 expression, DNA methylation sites, prognosis, immune \ncheckpoint and clinical characteristics of patients. Finally, in vitro \nexperiment and the meta-analysis of thousands of patients further confirmed the \nimpact of MPP2 on the prognosis of colorectal cancer patients and cell migration \nand proliferation. The expression level of MPP2 is negatively regulated by its \nDNA methylation sites, which leads to its low expression in colorectal cancer. \nHigh expression of MPP2 is an independent prognostic risk factor, which may be a \nbiomarker for colorectal cancer. Moreover, the expression of MPP2 shows a close \nrelationship with immune checkpoint or immune cells infiltration, especially \nCD4+T cells. In addition, meta-analysis involving 1584 patients from four \ndifferent data further confirmed that MPP2 was a risk factor for colorectal \ncancer. Finally, knockdown of MPP2 could significantly inhibit the proliferation \nof SW480 cells via mTOR signaling pathway. This study was the first to suggest \nthat MPP2 may become a promising biomarker, and has an important role in immune \ncheckpoint or immune cell infiltration in colorectal cancer.\n\n© 2024.

The \nadvent of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has dramatically changed our \nunderstanding of cancer biology and has altered the standards of care for \npatients. However, the impact of ICB on hematopoietic myeloid clonal expansion \nremains to be determined. We studied if exposure to ICB therapy affects \nhematopoietic clonal architecture and if their evolution contributed to altered \nhematopoiesis. Blood samples from patients with melanoma and NSCLC (n = 142) \ndemonstrated a high prevalence of CH. Serial samples (or post ICB exposure \nsamples; n = 25) were evaluated in melanoma and NSCLC patients. Error-corrected \nsequencing of a targeted panel of genes recurrently mutated in CH was performed \non peripheral blood genomic DNA. In serial sample analysis, we observed that \nmutations in DNMT3A and TET2 increased in size with longer ICB exposures in the \nmelanoma cohort. We also noted that patients with larger size DNMT3A mutations \nwith further post ICB clone size expansion had longer durations of ICB exposure. \nAll serial samples in this cohort showed a statistically significant change in \nVAF from baseline. In the serial sample analysis of NSCLC patients, we observed \nsimilar epigenetic expansion, although not statistically significant. Our study \ngenerates a hypothesis for two important questions: (a) Can DNMT3A or TET2 CH \nserve as predictors of a response to ICB therapy and serve as a novel biomarker \nof response to ICB therapy?

However, the regulatory pattern of DNA methylation \nin long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) for breast cancer remains unclear. In this \nstudy, we integrated gene expression, DNA methylation, and clinical data from \nbreast cancer patients included in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. We \nexamined DNA methylation distribution across various lncRNA categories, \nrevealing distinct methylation characteristics. Through genome-wide correlation \nanalysis, we identified the CpG sites located in lncRNAs and the distally \nassociated CpG sites of lncRNAs. Functional genome enrichment analysis, \nconducted through the integration of ENCODE ChIP-seq data, revealed that \ndifferentially methylated CpG sites (DMCs) in lncRNAs were mostly located in \npromoter regions, while distally associated DMCs primarily acted on enhancer \nregions. By integrating Hi-C data, we found that DMCs in enhancer and promoter \nregions were closely associated with the changes in three-dimensional chromatin \nstructures by affecting the formation of enhancer-promoter loops. Furthermore, \nthrough Cox regression analysis and three machine learning models, we identified \n11 key methylation-driven lncRNAs (DIO3OS, ELOVL2-AS1, MIAT, LINC00536, \nC9orf163, AC105398.1, LINC02178, MILIP, HID1-AS1, KCNH1-IT1, and TMEM220-AS1) \nthat were associated with the survival of breast cancer patients and constructed \na prognostic risk scoring model, which demonstrated strong prognostic \nperformance.

The \nunderlying biological mechanisms of this disparity remain uncertain. Here, we \naddress this knowledge gap by examining the association between overall \nepigenetic age acceleration and BrCa initiation as well as the mediating role of \nrace.\nRESULTS: We measured whole-genome methylation (866,238 CpGs) using the Illumina \nEPIC array in blood DNA extracted from 209 women recruited from University \nHospitals Cleveland Medical Center. Overall and intrinsic epigenetic age \nacceleration was calculated-accounting for the estimated white blood cell \ndistribution-using the second-generation biological clock GrimAge. After quality \ncontrol, 149 BrCa patients and 42 disease-free controls remained. The overall \nchronological mean age at BrCa diagnosis was 57.4 ± 11.4 years and nearly \none-third of BrCa cases were self-reported Black women (29.5%). When comparing \nBrCa cases to disease-free controls, GrimAge acceleration was 2.48 years greater \n(p-value = 0.0056), while intrinsic epigenetic age acceleration was 1.72 years \nhigher (p-value = 0.026) for cases compared to controls. After adjusting for \nknown BrCa risk factors, we observed BrCa risk increased by 14% [odds ratio (OR) \n= 1.14; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.25] for a one-year increase in GrimAge acceleration. The \nstratified analysis by self-reported race revealed differing ORs for GrimAge \nacceleration: White women (OR = 1.17; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.36), and Black women (OR = \n1.08; 95% CI: 0.96, 1.23). However, our limited sample size failed to detect a \nstatistically significant interaction for self-reported race (p-value >0.05) \nwhen examining GrimAge acceleration with BrCa risk.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that epigenetic age acceleration is \nassociated with BrCa risk, and the association suggests variation by \nself-reported race. Although our sample size is limited, these results highlight \na potential biological mechanism for BrCa risk and identifies a novel research \narea of BrCa health disparities requiring further inquiry.\n\nCopyright: © 2024 Wu et al.

Its potential role in lipid metabolism and prognosis of prostate \ncancer (PCa) remains unexplored.\nOBJECTIVES: This study investigated the impact of m1A on lipid metabolism and \nPCa prognosis.\nMETHODS: In this work, the landscape of genetic and expression variations of 10 \nwidely recognized m1A regulators in PCa was revealed. Combining machine-learning \nstrategies, the m1A modification patterns and corresponding characteristics of \nlipid metabolism of PCa samples from the cancer genome atlas program (TCGA) \ndataset were comprehensively analyzed. In vitro assays were performed to \nidentify the role of TRMT61A, the key m1A regulator, on PCa cells.\nRESULTS: Two distinct m1A modification patterns and corresponding lipid \nmetabolism profiles were identified in PCa. The m1A modification subgroup with a \nhigh risk of biochemical recurrence (BCR) has stronger mitochondrial metabolism \nand FA oxidation activity. A consensus m1A modification-related lipid metabolism \nscore (mMLMS) was constructed to predict the BCR prognosis of patients with PCa. \nThe mMLMS was shown to accurately predict the BCR prognosis of PCa within six \nexternal cohorts. Finally, TRMT61A was identified as the key m1A regulator \nrelated to mMLMS, and it was found to promote the progression of PCa in vitro. \nTRMT61A potentially enhances mitochondrial function and FA beta oxidation in PCa \ncells via the PI3K/AKT pathway.\nCONCLUSION: m1A RNA methylation patterns are associated with characteristics of \nlipid metabolism in PCa, providing a novel treatment strategy.\n\nCopyright © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

While previous work has primarily focussed on \nunderstanding the direct and indirect mechanisms of Hepatitis B virus X protein \n(HBx)-mediated hepatocarcinogenesis, from genetic and epigenetic perspectives, \nits influence on RNA modification mediated onset of liver malignancies is less \nwell understood. This study explored the role of HBV-encoded HBx in altering the \nm6A methylome profile and its implications on the pathogenesis of HCC. We \nestablished HBx-expressing stable HCC cell lines, Huh7-HBx and HepG2-HBx, and \nexplored the transcriptomic and epitranscriptomic profiles by RNA-seq and \nMeRIP-seq, respectively. Preliminary results suggest that HBx promotes liver \ncell proliferation, migration, survival and overall m6A methylation in HCC cells \nand is involved in modulating the extracellular matrix. We show that HBx \nmediates liver cell transformation by upregulating KIAA1429 methyltransferase. \nHBx also drives the expression and hypermethylation of the extracellular matrix \nprotein HSPG2/Perlecan and promotes tumourigenesis. Furthermore, we observed a \npotential interaction between KIAA1429 and HSPG2 in HCC liver cancer cells and \ndemands further investigation.\n\n© 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.\n\nDOI: 10.1002/mc.23830\nPMID: 39412412 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

It plays a special inhibitory immune \ncheckpoint role due to its unique domain and signaling pattern. Our aim is to \nexplore the correlation between LAG3 in cancers and physiological processes \nrelated to a range of cancers, as well as build LAG3-related immunity and \nprognostic models. By comprehensively using of datasets and methods from TCGA, \nGTE-x and GEO databases, cBioPortal, HPA, Kaplan-Meier Plotter, Spearman, \nCellMinerTM, we delved deeper into the potential impact of the LAG3 in cancer \ndevelopment. These include expression differences, Localization of tumor cell \nsubsets, immune infiltration, matrix infiltration, gene mutations, DNA \nmethylation, signaling pathways and prognosis. Furthermore, we explored LAG3 \ninteractions with different drugs. LAG3 is highly expressed in ACC (p < 0.001), \nBRCA (p < 0.001), DLBC (p < 0.001), ESCA (p < 0.001), GBM (p < 0.001), HNSC \n(p < 0.001), KIRC (p < 0.001), LGG (p < 0.001), LUAD (p < 0.01), LUSC \n(p < 0.001), PAAD (p < 0.001), PCPG (p < 0.01), SKCM (p < 0.001), STAD \n(p < 0.001), TGCT (p < 0.001) and THCA (p < 0.05), while lowly expressed in COAD \n(p < 0.001), LIHC (p < 0.05), OV (p < 0.001), PRAD (p < 0.001), READ \n(p < 0.001), UCEC (p < 0.001) and UCS (p < 0.001). High expression of LAG3 \ncorrelates with longer overall survival (OS) in BLCA (HR = 0.67, p < 0.05), CESC \n(HR = 0.3, p < 0.001), HNSC (HR = 0.67, p < 0.01), LUSC (HR = 0.71, p < 0.05), \nOV (HR = 0.65, p < 0.01), STAD (HR = 0.68, p < 0.05), and UCEC (HR = 0.57, \np < 0.01). Conversely, in KIRC (HR = 1.85, p < 0.001), KIRP (HR = 2.81, \np < 0.001), and THYM (HR = 8.92, p < 0.001), high LAG3 expression corresponds to \nshorter OS. Comprehensive results for recurrence-free survival (RFS) indicate \nthat LAG3 acts as a protective factor in BLCA, CESC, OV, and UCEC. Moreover, \nLAG3 is widely expressed in tumor-associated lymphocytes, positively correlating \nwith tumor immune scores and stromal scores, and significantly present in the C2 \nimmune subtype across various tumors. High LAG3 expression correlates with \nincreased immune infiltration. LAG3 shows associations with MSI, TMB, and the \nMMR system, participating in multiple signaling pathways including the T cell \nreceptor pathway. It also demonstrates positive correlations with sensitivity to \neleven different drugs. Unlike traditional inhibitory immune checkpoints, LAG3 \nexhibits dual roles in clinical and immune prognostication across pan-cancers, \nmaking it a significant predictive factor. In some cancers, LAG3 serves as a \nrisk factor, indicating adverse clinical outcomes. Conversely, in BLCA, CESC, \nOV, and UCEC, LAG3 acts as a protective factor associated with longer patient \nsurvival. LAG3 demonstrates strong associations within tumor immunity, \nparticipating in a range of immune and inflammatory signaling pathways. Elevated \nlevels of LAG3 are linked not only to T cell exhaustion but also to increased \nimmune infiltration and polarization towards M1 macrophages.\n\n© 2024.

To identify PCa risk-associated CpG \nsites in prostate tissue, we established genetic prediction models of DNAm \nlevels using data from normal prostate samples in the GTEx (N = 108) and \nassessed associations between genetically predicted DNAm in prostate and PCa \nrisk by studying 122,188 cases and 604,640 controls. We observed significant \nassociations for 3879 CpG sites, including 926 at novel genomic loci. Among \nthem, DNAm levels of 80 CpG sites located at novel loci are significantly \nassociated with expression levels of 45 neighboring genes in normal prostate \ntissue. Of these genes, 11 further exhibit significant associations with PCa \nrisk for their predicted expression levels in prostate tissue. Intriguingly, a \ntotal of 31 CpG sites demonstrate consistent association patterns across the \nmethylation-gene expression-PCa risk pathway. Our findings suggest that specific \nCpG sites may be related to PCa risk by modulating the expression of nearby \ntarget genes.\n\n© 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.\n\nDOI: 10.1002/mc.23828\nPMCID: PMC12009774\nPMID: 39400371 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: Conflicts of Interest Statement L.W. provided \nconsulting service to Pupil Bio Inc. and reviewed manuscripts for \nGastroenterology Report, not related to this study, and received honorarium.

Given that \nreduced CAF abundance in tumours correlates with improved outcomes in various \ncancers, we set out to identify epigenetic targets involved in CAF activation in \nregions of tumour-stromal mixing with the goal of reducing tumour \naggressiveness. Using the GLAnCE (Gels for Live Analysis of Compartmentalized \nEnvironments) platform, we performed an image-based, phenotypic screen that \nenabled us to identify modulators of CAF abundance and the capacity of CAFs to \ninduce tumour cell invasion. We identified EHMT2 (also known as G9a), an enzyme \nthat targets the methylation of histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9), as a potent modulator \nof CAF abundance and CAF-mediated tumour cell invasion. Transcriptomic and \nfunctional analysis of EHMT2-inhibited CAFs revealed EHMT2 participated in \ndriving CAFs towards a pro-invasive phenotype and mediated CAF \nhyperproliferation, a feature typically associated with activated fibroblasts in \ntumours. Our study suggests that EHMT2 regulates CAF state within the tumour \nmicroenvironment by impacting CAF activation, as well as by magnifying the \npro-invasive effects of these activated CAFs on tumour cell invasion through \npromoting CAF hyperproliferation.\n\nCopyright © 2024 The Authors.

In this study, we identified that RNA m5C methyltransferase \nNSUN2 was significantly upregulated in Cr(VI)-transformed cells and lung tissues \nof Cr(VI)-exposed mice. Inhibition of NSUN2 reduced cell proliferation, \nmigration, colony formation and tube formation abilities. We found \nNSUN2-mediated m5C modification induced metabolic reprogramming and cell cycle \nby promoting the mRNA stabilities of ME1, GLUT3 and CDK2. In addition, knockdown \nof NSUN2 attenuated tumorigenesis and angiogenesis in vivo. RNA m5C reader \nALYREF was identified to be involved in NSUN2-mediated m5C modification in Cr \n(VI)-induced carcinogenesis. Further study showed that EP300 induced NSUN2 \nupregulation through transcriptional activation by inducing histone modification \nat H3K27ac site for regulating Cr(VI) carcinogenesis. Our findings demonstrated \nnovel role and mechanism of NSUN2 and epigenetic changes by increasing the RNA \nm5C modification that are important for Cr (VI)-induced carcinogenesis through \nNSUN2/ALYREF pathway.

We conducted association studies \nand machine learning modeling to analyze the genome-wide 5hmC profiles within \ntraining and validation groups that were randomly selected at a 2:1 ratio.\nRESULTS: We successfully obtained 5hmC profiles from these decades-old samples. \nA weighted Cox model of 32 5hmC-modified gene bodies showed a predictive \ndetection value for CRC as early as 36 months before overt tumor diagnosis \n(training set AUC, 77.1% [95% CI, 72.2 to 81.9] and validation set AUC, 72.8% \n[95% CI, 65.8 to 79.7]). Notably, the 5hmC-based predictive model showed \ncomparable performance regardless of sex and race/ethnicity, and significantly \noutperformed risk factors such as age and obesity (assessed as BMI). Finally, \nwhen splitting cases at median weighted prediction scores, Kaplan-Meier analyses \nshowed significant risk stratification for CRC occurrence in both the training \nset (hazard ratio, [HR], 3.3 [95% CI, 2.6 to 5.8]) and validation set (HR, 3.1 \n[95% CI, 1.8 to 5.8]).\nCONCLUSION: Candidate 5hmC biomarkers and a scoring algorithm have the potential \nto predict CRC occurrence despite the absence of clinical symptoms and effective \npredictors. Developing a minimally invasive clinical assay that detects \n5hmC-modified biomarkers holds promise for improving early CRC detection and \nultimately patient outcomes.\n\nDOI: 10.1200/PO.24.00277\nPMCID: PMC11729496\nPMID: 39393034 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

The \nextensive multi-omic data obtained from multi-level molecular biology provides a \nunique perspective for understanding the underlying biological characteristics \nof cancer, offering potential prognostic indicators and drug sensitivity \nbiomarkers for LUSC patients. We integrated diverse datasets encompassing gene \nexpression, DNA methylation, genomic mutations, and clinical data from LUSC \npatients to achieve consensus clustering using a suite of 10 multi-omics \nintegration algorithms. Subsequently, we employed 10 commonly used machine \nlearning algorithms, combining them into 101 unique configurations to design an \noptimal performing model. We then explored the characteristics of high- and \nlow-risk LUSC patient groups in terms of the tumor microenvironment and response \nto immunotherapy, ultimately validating the functional roles of the model genes \nthrough in vitro experiments. Through the application of 10 clustering \nalgorithms, we identified two prognostically relevant subtypes, with CS1 \nexhibiting a more favorable prognosis. We then constructed a subtype-specific \nmachine learning model, LUSC multi-omics signature (LMS) based on seven key hub \ngenes. Compared to previously published LUSC biomarkers, our LMS score \ndemonstrated superior predictive performance. Patients with lower LMS scores had \nhigher overall survival rates and better responses to immunotherapy. Notably, \nthe high LMS group was more inclined toward \"cold\" tumors, characterized by \nimmune suppression and exclusion, but drugs like dasatinib may represent \npromising therapeutic options for these patients. Notably, we also validated the \nmodel gene SERPINB13 through cell experiments, confirming its role as a \npotential oncogene influencing the progression of LUSC and as a promising \ntherapeutic target.

We identified a 3-CpG methylation signature that is independently \nassociated with CRC prognosis. The model consists of three methylation-driven \ngenes: FAM3 Metabolism Regulating Signaling Molecule D (FAM3D), DAPP1, and PIGR. \nHowever, the prognostic significance, biological function, and related \nmechanisms of the individual methylation-driven gene FAM3D in CRC have not been \nstudied.

In addition, FAM3D promoted the \ngrowth and movement of CRC cells in vitro and the proliferation in nude mice, \nmainly by inhibiting ATF4 transcription and downregulating SESN2 expression, and \nultimately activating mTORC1. Furthermore, FAM3D resulted in reduced sensitivity \nof CRC cells to oxaliplatin, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil. Our study showed \nthat FAM3D activates the mTORC1 pathway through the ATF4-SESN2 axis and promotes \nthe malignant progression of CRC, which contributes to predict CRC prognosis and \nguide individualized treatment.\n\nDOI: 10.18632/aging.206115\nPMCID: PMC11501385\nPMID: 39388305 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: CONFLICTS OF INTEREST: The authors declare that \nthey have no conflicts of interest."

We examined the expression patterns and \nprognostic relevance of Anoikis-related genes (ARGs) in lung adenocarcinoma \n(LUAD) using the TCGA-LUAD database. This study identified molecular subtypes \nassociated with Anoikis in LUAD and conducted functional enrichment analyses. We \nconstructed an ARG risk score using univariate least absolute shrinkage and \nselection operator (LASSO) Cox regression, validated externally with GEO \ndatasets and clinical samples. The clinical applicability of the prognostic \nmodel was evaluated using nomograms, calibration curves, decision curve analysis \n(DCA), and time-dependent AUC assessments. We identified four prognostically \nsignificant genes (PLK1, SLC2A1, CDKN3, PHLDA2) and two ARG-related molecular \nsubtypes. ARGs were generally upregulated in LUAD and correlated with multiple \npathways including the cell cycle and DNA replication. The prognostic model \nindicated that the low-risk group had better outcomes and significant \ncorrelations with clinicopathological features, tumor microenvironment, immune \ntherapy responses, drug sensitivity, and pan-RNA epigenetic modification-related \ngenes. Patients with low-risk LUAD were potential beneficiaries of immune \ncheckpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy. Prognostic ARGs' distribution and expression \nacross various immune cell types were further analyzed using single-cell RNA \nsequencing. The pivotal role of CDKN3 in LUAD was confirmed through qRT-PCR and \ngene knockout experiments, demonstrating that CDKN3 knockdown inhibits tumor \ncell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Additionally, we constructed a \nceRNA network involving CDKN3/hsa-miR-26a-5p/SNHG6, LINC00665, DUXAP8, and \nSLC2A1/hsa-miR-218-5p/RNASEH1-AS1, providing new insights for personalized and \nimmune therapy decisions in LUAD patients.\n\nCopyright © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most \ncommon BM source and here we obtained 402 tumor and plasma samples from a large \ncohort of patients with LUAD with or without BM (n = 346). LUAD DNA methylation \nsignatures were evaluated to build and validate an accurate model predicting BM \ndevelopment from LUAD, which was integrated with clinical factors to provide \ncomprehensive patient-specific BM risk probabilities in a nomogram. \nAdditionally, immune and cell interaction gene sets were differentially \nmethylated at promoters in BM versus paired primary LUAD and had aligning \ndysregulation in the proteome. Immune cells were differentially abundant in BM \nversus LUAD. Finally, liquid biomarkers identified from methylated cell-free DNA \nsequenced in plasma were used to generate and validate accurate classifiers for \nearly BM detection. Overall, LUAD methylomes can be leveraged to predict and \nnoninvasively identify BM, moving toward improved patient outcomes with \npersonalized treatment.\n\n© 2024.

As new \nmethylation microarrays are developed and older models discontinued, existing \nepigenetic clocks might become obsolete. Here, we explored the effects of the \nchanges introduced in the new EPICv2 DNA methylation array on existing \nepigenetic clocks.\nMETHODS: We tested the performance of four epigenetic clocks on the probeset of \nthe EPICv2 array using a dataset of 10,835 samples. We developed a new \nepigenetic age prediction model compatible across the 450 k, EPICv1, and EPICv2 \nmicroarrays and validated it on 2095 samples. We estimated technical noise and \nintra-subject variation using two datasets with repeated sampling. We used data \nfrom (i) cancer survivors who had undergone different therapies, (ii) breast \ncancer patients and controls, and (iii) an exercise-based interventional study, \nto test the ability of our model to detect alterations in epigenetic age \nacceleration in response to theoretically antiaging interventions.\nRESULTS: The results of the four epiclocks tested are significantly distorted by \nthe EPICv2 probeset, causing an average difference of up to 25 years. Our new \nmodel produced highly accurate chronological age predictions, comparable to a \nstate-of-the-art epiclock. The model reported the lowest epigenetic age \nacceleration in normal populations, as well as the lowest variation across \ntechnical replicates and repeated samples from the same subjects. Finally, our \nmodel reproduced previous results of increased epigenetic age acceleration in \ncancer patients and in survivors treated with radiation therapy, and no changes \nfrom exercise-based interventions.\nCONCLUSION: Existing epigenetic clocks require updates for full EPICv2 \ncompatibility. Our new model translates the capabilities of state-of-the-art \nepigenetic clocks to the EPICv2 platform and is cross-compatible with older \nmicroarrays. The characterization of epigenetic age prediction variation \nprovides useful metrics to contextualize the relevance of epigenetic age \nalterations. The analysis of data from subjects influenced by radiation, cancer, \nand exercise-based interventions shows that despite being good predictors of \nchronological age, neither a pathological state like breast cancer, a hazardous \nenvironmental factor (radiation), nor exercise (a beneficial intervention) \ncaused significant changes in the values of the \"epigenetic age\" determined by \nthese first-generation models.\n\n© 2024.

This study investigates circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) as a \nbiomarker for assessing recurrence risk in patients with resectable gastric and \nGEJ adenocarcinomas (AC).\nMETHODS: Patients with resectable gastric and GEJ AC, undergoing perioperative \nchemotherapy and surgery, were prospectively enrolled. Serial plasma samples \nwere collected at baseline, after one cycle of chemotherapy, after preoperative \nchemotherapy, and after surgery. ctDNA was assessed by a ddPCR test (TriMeth), \nwhich targets the gastrointestinal cancer-specific methylation patterns of the \ngenes C9orf50, KCNQ5, and CLIP4.\nRESULTS: ctDNA analysis was performed on 229 plasma samples from 86 patients. At \nbaseline, ctDNA was detected in 56% of patients, which decreased to 37% \nfollowing one cycle of chemotherapy, 25% after preoperative chemotherapy and 15% \nafter surgical resection. The presence of ctDNA after one cycle of chemotherapy \nwas associated with reduced recurrence-free survival (RFS) (HR = 2.54, 95% \nconfidence interval (CI) 1.33-4.85, p = 0.005) and overall survival (OS) \n(HR = 2.23, 95% CI 1.07-4.62, p = 0.032). Similarly, ctDNA after surgery was \nassociated with significantly shorter RFS (HR = 6.22, 95% CI 2.39-16.2, \np < 0.001) and OS (HR = 6.37, 95% CI 2.10-19.3, p = 0.001). Multivariable \nregression analysis confirmed ctDNA after surgery as an independent prognostic \nfactor (p < 0.001).\nCONCLUSION: ctDNA analysis has the potential to identify patients at elevated \nrisk of recurrence, thus providing personalized treatment strategies for \npatients with resectable gastric and GEJ cancer.

We performed transcriptomic \nanalyses (including bulk and spatial transcriptomics) and multiplex \nimmunofluorescence on pre-treated samples from LUADs without transformation \nafter EGFR-TKI treatment (LUAD-NT), primary SCLCs (SCLC-P) and LUADs with \ntransformation after EGFR-TKI treatment (before transformation: LUAD-BT; after \ntransformation: SCLC-AT). Our study found that LUAD-BT exhibited potential \ntranscriptomic characteristics for transformation compared with LUAD-NT. We \nidentified several pathways that shifted during transformation, and the \ntransformation might be promoted by epigenetic alterations (such as HDAC10, \nHDAC1, DNMT3A) within the tumor cells instead of within the tumor \nmicroenvironment. For druggable pathways, transformed-SCLC were proved to be \nless dependent on EGF signaling but more relied on FGF signaling, while \nVEGF-VEGFR pathway remained active, indicating potential treatments after \ntransformation. We also found transformed-SCLC showed an immuno-exhausted status \nwhich was associated with the duration of EGFR-TKI before transformation. \nBesides, SCLC-AT exhibited distinct molecular subtypes from SCLC-P. Moreover, we \nconstructed an ideal 4-marker model based on transcriptomic and IHC data to \npredict SCLC transformation, which obtained a sensitivity of 100% and 87.5%, a \nspecificity of 95.7% and 100% in the training and test cohorts, respectively. We \nprovided insights into the molecular mechanisms of SCLC transformation and the \ndifferences between SCLC-AT and SCLC-P, which might shed light on prevention \nstrategies and subsequent therapeutic strategies for SCLC transformation in the \nfuture.\n\n© 2024.

DNA methylation changes in peripheral blood \nmononuclear cells (PBMCs) could reflect an immune response to tumorigenesis, \nproviding the theoretical basis for early cancer diagnosis based on immune cell \nprofiling.\nMETHODS: This multi-center study evaluated the DNA methylation patterns based on \nPBMCs samples from 1115 individuals at nine medical centers. Genome-wide DNA \nmethylation profiling of PBMCs in a discovery cohort (35 LUAD patients and 50 \nhealthy controls) was performed using Illumina 850K microarray. Candidate \ndifferentially methylated CpG positions (DMPs) were selected and validated in a \ntwo-step DMPs screening cohort (65 LUAD patients and 80 healthy controls) by \npyrosequencing and multiple target region methylation enrichment sequencing \n(MTRMES). Then, an early LUAD Diagnostic Panel (LDP score) based on multisite \nmethylation-specific chip-based digital PCR was constructed in a training set \nand then confirmed in a validation set from the LDP score development cohort \n(389 AIS/stage I LUAD patients and 293 healthy controls). Besides, we included \n157 other cancer patients, including 52 gastric cancer (GC) patients, 50 breast \ncancer (BC) patients, and 55 colorectal cancer (CRC) patients to assess the \nspecificity of the LDP score. In addition, we also evaluated the early warning \nability of LDP score for LUAD in a prospective cohort (46 people who were at \nhigh-risk of developing LC).\nRESULTS: A total of 1415 LUAD-specific DMPs were identified. Then, six DMPs were \nselected for validation and three DMPs were finally verified. The LDP score was \nconstructed by combining the three DMPs, age, and sex, and showed an AUC of \n0.916, sensitivity of 88.17%, and specificity of 80.20% in a combined set, \noutperforming traditional methods, such as CEA and CT (detection rate: 87.79% \nvs. 4.69%; 87.79% vs. 35.21%). This diagnostic performance was confirmed in \nsub-types of LUAD with clinical challenges, such as 6-20 mm LUAD (AUC: 0.914, \n95% CI: 0.889-0.934) and ground-glass nodules (AUC: 0.916, 95% CI: 0.889-0.938). \nImportantly, our LDP score had significant improvement in terms of selecting \nhigh-risk individuals who should receive low-dose computed tomography (87.80% \nvs. 9.28%). Remarkably, the LDP score could predict LUAD around 2 years before \nclinical diagnosis in our prospective cohort.\nCONCLUSIONS: The novel developed LDP score represented a convenient and \neffective assay for the detection of AIS/stage I LUAD with high sensitivity and \nspecificity, and had demonstrated unique advantages over traditional detection \nmethods.\n\nCopyright © 2024 The Author(s).

Recently, a SMARCA2::CREM \nfusion was reported in one case each of IMMT and HCCC. In this study, we expand \nthe clinicopathologic and molecular spectrum of these neoplasms by describing \nthree additional cases with SMARCA2::CREM and one with a novel SMARCA4::CREM \nfusion, highlighting the recurrent potential of additional CREB gene fusion \npartners beyond FET family members. To evaluate if these fusions define a new \npathologic entity, we performed a comprehensive genomic and methylation analysis \nand compared the results to other related tumors. Tumors occurred in children \nand young adults (median age 20 years) and spanned a broad anatomic \ndistribution, including soft tissue, intracranial, head and neck, and prostatic \nurethra. Microscopically, the tumors shared an undifferentiated round to \nepithelioid cell phenotype and a hyalinized fibrous stroma. \nImmunohistochemically, a polyphenotypic profile was observed, with variable \nexpression of SOX10, desmin, and/or epithelial markers. No targetable genomic \nalterations were found using panel-based DNA sequencing. By DNA methylation and \ntranscriptomic analyses, tumors grouped closely to FET::CREB entities, but not \nwith SMARCA4/SMARCB1-deficient tumors. High expression of CREM by \nimmunohistochemistry was also documented in these tumors. Patients experienced \nlocal recurrence (n = 2), locoregional lymph node metastases (n = 2), and an \nisolated visceral metastasis (n = 1). Overall, our study suggests that \nSMARCA2/4::CREM fusions define a distinct group of neoplasms with round cell to \nepithelioid histology, a variable immunoprofile, and a definite risk of \nmalignancy. Larger studies are needed to further explore the pathogenetic \nrelationship with the FET::CREB family of tumors. © 2024 The Pathological \nSociety of Great Britain and Ireland.\n\n© 2024 The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.\n\nDOI: 10.1002/path.6350\nPMCID: PMC12131337\nPMID: 39344423 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: No conflicts of interest were declared"

Electronic address: \nhuaxiaohui0328@163.com.\n\nBenzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) is a well-known polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) \npollutant with high carcinogenicity, widespread environmental presence, and \nsignificant threat to public health. Epidemiological studies have linked \nexposure to B[a]P and its metabolite 7,8-dihydroxy-9,10-epoxybenzo[a]pyrene \n(BPDE) to the development and progression of various cancers, including bladder \ncancer. However, its underlying mechanism remains unclear. Our study revealed \nthat B[a]P and BPDE induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a critical \nearly event in cell malignant transformation, involving a decrease in E-Cadherin \nand upregulation of N-Cadherin protein levels, leading to increased cell \nmotility and migration in bladder epithelial cells. Further studies have \nindicated that LOXL1 DNA undergoes methylation and modification influenced by \nmethyltransferase 3a (DNMT3a) and DNMT3b, resulting in decreased LOXL1 protein \nlevels. The decreased LOXL1 promotes the zinc finger transcription factor SLUG, \nwhich then inhibits E-Cadherin protein levels and initiates the EMT process. \nMoreover, DNMT3a/3b expression appears to be influenced by intracellular \noxidative stress levels. These findings suggest that exposure to B[a]P/BPDE \npromotes the EMT process through the pivotal factor LOXL1, thereby contributing \nto bladder carcinogenesis. Our study provides a theoretical basis for \nconsidering LOXL1 as a potential biomarker for early diagnosis and a novel \ntarget for the precise diagnosis and treatment of bladder cancer.\n\nCopyright © 2024 The Author(s).

Pancreatitis, characterized by the increased infiltration of \nmacrophages into the pancreas, is a known risk factor for pancreatic cancer. The \nNRF2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2) transcription factor \nregulates responses to oxidative stress and can promote cancer and \nchemoresistance. NRF2 also attenuates inflammation through the regulation of \nmacrophage-specific genes. Heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) is expressed by \nanti-inflammatory macrophages to degrade heme, and its expression is dependent \non NRF2 translocation to the nucleus. In macrophages stimulated with conditioned \nmedia from pancreatic cancer cells, HO-1 protein levels increased, which \ncorrelated with higher NRF2 expression in the nuclear fraction. Significant \ndifferences in macrophage infiltration and HO-1 expression were detected in \nLSL-KrasG12D/+; Pdx-1-Cre (KC) mice, Nrf2 whole-body knockout (KO) mice and \nwildtype mice with pancreatitis. Since epigenetic modulation is a mechanism used \nby tumors to regulate the TME, using small molecules as epigenetic modulators to \nactivate immune recognition is therapeutically desirable. When the bromodomain \ninhibitor I-BET-762 was used to treat macrophages or mice with pancreatitis, \nhigh levels of HO-1 were reduced. This study shows that bromodomain inhibitors \ncan be used to prevent physiological responses to inflammation that promote \ntumorigenesis.\n\nDOI: 10.3390/ijms25189985\nPMCID: PMC11432103\nPMID: 39337472 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare no conflicts of interest."

Prognosis for \npatients treated with hypomethylating agents (HMAs), as is azacytidine, the main \ndrug used as frontline therapy for MDS is mostly based on cytogenetics and next \ngeneration sequencing (NGS) of the initial myeloid clone. Although the critical \ninfluence of the epigenetic landscape upon cancer cells survival and development \nas well on tumour environment establishment is currently recognized and \napproached within current clinical practice in MDS, the heterogenous response of \nthe patients to epigenetic therapy is suggesting a more complex mechanism of \naction, as is the case of RNA methylation. In this sense, the newly emerging \nfield of epitranscriptomics could provide a more comprehensive perspective upon \nthe modulation of gene expression in malignancies, as is the proof-of-concept of \nMDS. We initially did RNA methylation sequencing on MDS patients (n = 6) treated \nwith azacytidine and compared responders with non-responders. Afterwards, the \ngenes identified were assessed in vitro and afterwards validated on a larger \ncohort of MDS patients treated with azacytidine (n = 58). Our data show that a \nmore accurate prognosis could be based on analysing the methylome and thus we \nused methylation sequencing to differentially split high-grade MDS patients with \nidentical demographical and cytogenetic features, between azacytidine responders \nand non-responders.\n\n© 2024 The Author(s).

Despite recent advances in molecular testing and the identification \nof tumor-specific mutations or gene fusions, there is an unmet need to identify \nadditional diagnostic biomarkers for entities lacking specific alterations. In \nthis study, we collected a comprehensive cohort of 363 cases encompassing 20 \ndifferent salivary gland tumor entities and explored the potential of DNA \nmethylation to classify these tumors. We were able to show that most entities \nshow specific epigenetic signatures and present a machine learning algorithm \nthat achieved a mean balanced accuracy of 0.991. Of note, we showed that \ncribriform adenocarcinoma is epigenetically distinct from classical polymorphous \nadenocarcinoma, which could support risk stratification of these tumors. \nMyoepithelioma and pleomorphic adenoma form a uniform epigenetic class, \nsupporting the theory of a single entity with a broad but continuous morphologic \nspectrum. Furthermore, we identified a histomorphologically heterogeneous but \nepigenetically distinct class that could represent a novel tumor entity. In \nconclusion, our study provides a comprehensive resource of the DNA methylation \nlandscape of salivary gland tumors. Our data provide novel insight into disputed \nentities and show the potential of DNA methylation to identify new tumor \nclasses. Furthermore, in future, our machine learning classifier could support \nthe histopathologic diagnosis of salivary gland tumors.\n\nCopyright © 2024 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

All \nsamples were assessed by liquid-based cytology, HPV genotyping and PAX1/SOX1 \nmethylation.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: AUC (area under the curve), sensitivity and specificity \nfor cytology, HPV16/18 genotyping and PAX1/SOX1 methylation for high-grade (HG) \npremalignant cervical lesions.\nRESULTS: PAX1 was more sensitive than cytology and HPV16/18 genotyping in \ndetecting a HG lesion (CIN2+). The sensitivity for PAX1, SOX1, cytology and \nHPV16/18 were 73.5% (95% CI: 65.5-81.5), 41.9% (95% CI: 32.9-50.8), 48.7% (95% \nCI: 39.7-57.8) and 36.8% (95% CI: 28.0-45.5), respectively, and their respective \nspecificities were 70.3% (95% CI: 65.0-75.6), 83.6% (95% CI: 79.3-87.9), 77.6% \n(95% CI: 72.8-82.5) and 67.1% (95% CI: 61.7-72.6), respectively. Overall, PAX1 \ngave the best AUC at 0.72. Adding SOX1 to PAX1 did not improve the AUC (0.68). \nThree hundred and twenty-two women who did not have a HG lesion at baseline were \nfollowed up for two rounds of screening. Fewer women developed a HG lesion with \na normal baseline PAX1 compared to women with a normal baseline cytology or \nnegative HPV16/18 (8.4% vs. 14.5% and 17.5%, respectively).\nCONCLUSION: PAX1 triage for referral to colposcopy in HPV-positive women may be \nsuperior to cytology and HPV16/18 genotyping.\n\n© 2024 The Author(s).

In this study, we investigated the \nmolecular mechanisms underlying hNTCP dysregulation using HCC tissues and cell \nlines, and primary human hepatocytes (PHHs). Firstly, we observed a significant \nreduction of hNTCP in HCC tumors compared to adjacent and normal tissues. \nAdditionally, hNTCP mRNA levels were markedly lower in HepG2 cells compared to \nPHHs, which was corroborated at the protein level by immunoblotting. Sanger \nsequencing confirmed identical sequences for hNTCP promoter, exons, and mRNA \ncoding sequences between PHH and HepG2 cells, indicating no mutations or \nsplicing alterations. We then assessed the epigenetic status of hNTCP. The hNTCP \npromoter, with low CG content, showed no significant methylation differences \nbetween PHH and HepG2 cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with qPCR \n(ChIP-qPCR) revealed a loss of activating histone posttranslational modification \n(PTM) H3K27ac near the hNTCP transcription start site (TSS) in HepG2 cells. This \nloss was also confirmed in HCC tumor cells compared to adjacent and background \ncells. Treating HepG2 cells with histone deacetylase inhibitors enhanced H3K27ac \naccumulation and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) binding at the hNTCP TSS, \nsignificantly increasing hNTCP mRNA and protein levels, and rendering the cells \nsusceptible to HBV infection. In summary, histone PTM-related epigenetic \nmechanisms play a critical role in hNTCP dysregulation in liver cancer cells, \nproviding insights into hepatocarcinogenesis and its impact on chronic HBV \ninfection.\nIMPORTANCE: HBV is a hepatotropic virus that infects human hepatocytes \nexpressing the viral receptor hNTCP. Without effective antiviral therapy, \nchronic HBV infection poses a high risk of liver cancer. However, most liver \ncancer cell lines, including HepG2 and Huh7, do not support HBV infection due to \nthe absence of hNTCP expression, and the mechanism underlying this defect \nremains unclear. This study demonstrates a significant reduction of hNTCP in \nhepatocellular carcinoma samples and HepG2 cells compared to normal liver \ntissues and primary human hepatocytes. Despite identical hNTCP genetic \nsequences, epigenetic analyses revealed a loss of the activating histone \nmodification H3K27ac near the hNTCP transcription start site in cancer cells. \nTreatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors restored H3K27ac levels, \nreactivated hNTCP expression, and rendered HepG2 cells susceptible to HBV \ninfection. These findings highlight the role of epigenetic modulation in hNTCP \ndysregulation, offering insights into hepatocarcinogenesis and its implications \nfor chronic HBV infection.\n\nDOI: 10.1128/jvi.01187-24\nPMCID: PMC11495020\nPMID: 39297647 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare no conflict of interest."

Classification systems based on p16 and \nKi67 expression cumulative scores (0-3 each)-p16/Ki67 collectively known as an \nimmunoscore [IS]-are an accurate and reproducible method for grading cervical \nintraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) lesions. Meanwhile, DNA methylation is an early \nevent in the development of cervical cancer. Hence, this study evaluated the \nrelationship among CIN, p16/Ki-67 IS, and PAX1/ZNF582 methylation.\nMETHODS: In this study, 414 HPV-positive paraffin-embedded specimens were \ncollected, and PAX1/ZNF582 methylation and the p16/ki67 IS were determined. A \ntotal of 43 invalid samples were excluded and 371 were included in the \nstatistical analyses. There were 103 cervicitis, 95 CIN1, 71 CIN2, 89 CIN3, and \n13 squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cases. The association between PAX1/ZNF582 \nmethylation and p16/Ki6 immunohistochemical staining scores was analyzed.\nRESULTS: The ΔCp of PAX1m (PAX1 methylation) and ZNF582m (ZNF582 methylation) \ndecreased with cervical lesion severity (Cuzick trend test, all P < 0.001). The \nseverity of the cervical lesions and p16, Ki67, and p16/Ki67 IS showed an \nincreasing trend (Multinomial Cochran-Armitage trend test, all P < 0.001). The \nprevalence of PAX1m/ZNF582m increased with an increase in the IS of p16, Ki67, \nand p16/Ki67 (Cochran-Armitage trend test, all P < 0.001). In cervical SCC, the \nIS was 5-6, and the PAX1m/ZNF582m was positive. Meanwhile, heterogeneity was \nobserved in CIN lesions: 10 cases had an IS of 3-4 and were \nPAX1m/ZNF582m-positive in ≤ CIN1; 1 case had an IS of 0-2 and was \nPAX1m/ZNF582m-positive in CIN2/3.\nCONCLUSIONS: Significant heterogeneity was observed in CIN lesions for p16 and \nKi67 immunohistochemical staining scores and PAX1/ZNF582 methylation. This may \nhelp clinicians personalize the management of CIN based on the predicted \nshort-term risk of cancer progression, minimizing the rate of missed CIN1 \ndiagnoses and incorrect treatment of CIN2/3.\n\n© 2024.

In this \nregard, repurposing non-oncology already-approved drugs might be an attractive \nstrategy to offer more-effective treatment easily tested in clinical trials. \nAccumulating evidence suggests that epigenetic deregulation is a hallmark of \ncancer contributing to treatment resistance in several solid tumors, including \nPDAC. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) are epigenetic drugs we have \ninvestigated preclinically and clinically as anticancer agents. Valproic acid \n(VPA) is a generic low-cost anticonvulsant and mood stabilizer with HDAC \ninhibitory activity, and anticancer properties also demonstrated in PDAC models. \nStatins use was reported to be associated with lower mortality risk in patients \nwith pancreatic cancer and statins have been shown to have a direct antitumor \neffect when used alone or in combination therapy. We recently showed capability \nof VPA/Simvastatin (SIM) combination to potentiate the antitumor activity of \ngemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel in vitro and in vivo PDAC preclinical models.\nMETHODS/DESIGN: VESPA is a patient-centric open label randomized multicenter \nphase-II investigator-initiated trial, evaluating the feasibility, safety, and \nefficacy of VPA/SIM plus first line gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel-based regimens \n(AG or PAXG) (experimental arm) versus chemotherapy alone (standard arm) in \nmPDAC patients. The study involves Italian and Spanish oncology centers and \nincludes an initial 6-patients safety run-in-phase. A sample size of 240 \npatients (120 for each arm) was calculated under the hypothesis that the \naddition of VPA/SIM to gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel-based regimens may extend \nprogression free survival from 6 to 9 months in the experimental arm. Secondary \nendpoints are overall survival, response rate, disease control rate, duration of \nresponse, CA 19.9 reduction, toxicity, and quality of life. The study includes a \npatient engagement plan and complementary biomarkers studies on tumor and blood \nsamples.\nCONCLUSIONS: VESPA is the first trial evaluating efficacy and safety of two \nrepurposed drugs in oncology such as VPA and SIM, in combination with standard \nchemotherapy, with the aim of improving mPDAC survival. The study is ongoing. \nEnrollment started in June 2023 and a total of 63 patients have been enrolled as \nof June 2024.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: EudraCT number: 2022-004154-63; ClinicalTrials.gov \nidentifier NCT05821556, posted 2023/04/20.\n\n© 2024.

Associations between methylation levels and \nincidence of hematopoietic malignancy is studied through time-to-event \nregression.

Predictive performance is validated in the \nindependent Older Finnish Twin Cohort.\nRESULTS AND INTERPRETATION: We identified 67 epigenetic markers for \nhematopoietic malignancies of which 12 are linked to genes associated with \nhematologic malignancies. For some markers, we discovered a 2-3-fold relative \nrisk difference for high versus low methylation. The identification of these 67 \nsites enabled the formation of a predictor demonstrating a cross-validated \ntime-varying area under the curve (AUC) of 92% 3 years after individual blood \nsampling and persistent performance above 70% up to 6 years after blood \nsampling. This predictive performance was to a large extent recovered in the \nvalidation sample showing an overall Harrell's C of 73%. In conclusion, from a \nlarge population representative twin study on hematopoietic cancers, novel \nepigenetic markers were identified that may prove useful for early diagnosis.\n\nDOI: 10.2340/1651-226X.2024.40700\nPMCID: PMC11423697\nPMID: 39295308 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors report there are no competing \ninterests to declare."

The expression of circFAM126A \ncorrelates with the stage of lung cancer and with the tumour diameter, and \ncircFAM126A can be used as a potential molecular target for lung cancer. The \nmolecular mechanism by which circFAM126A increases HSP90 ubiquitination and \nsuppresses AKT1 expression to regulate cellular glycolysis, ultimately \ninhibiting the progression of lung cancer, is elucidated. This study not only \nbroadens the knowledge regarding the expression and regulatory mode of circRNAs \nbut also provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms that regulate \ntumour cell metabolism and affect tumour cell fate from an epigenetic \nperspective. These findings will facilitate the development of new strategies \nfor lung cancer prevention and treatment.\n\n© 2024.

Therefore, sensitive and \naccurate biomarkers for early detection of CHD and stroke are urgently needed \nfor effective prevention and treatment. We aim to investigate the association \nbetween blood-based HYAL2 methylation and the risk of CHD and stroke in Chinese \npopulation.\nMETHODS: In a prospective nested case-control study comprising 171 CHD cases, \n139 stroke cases, who developed the diseases after recruitment and 356 controls \nwho remained healthy during the 2.5 years of follow-up time, the methylation \nlevel of HYAL2 in the peripheral blood was quantified using mass spectrometry, \nand the association was calculated by logistic regression adjusted for \ncovariant.\nRESULTS: Significant association between HYAL2 methylation in the peripheral \nblood and increased risk of preclinical CHD and stroke were identified [odds \nratios (ORs) per - 10% methylation: 1.35-1.64, p ≤ 0.045 for HYAL2_CpG_1, \nHYAL2_CpG_2 and HYAL2_CpG_3 in CHD; ORs per - 10% methylation: 0.76-1.64, \np ≤ 0.033 for HYAL2_CpG_2 and HYAL2_CpG_4 in stroke]. The association in CHD was \nfurther enhanced by female gender, younger age (< 70 years old), without the \nhistory of hypertension and cancer. The combination of four HYAL2 methylation \nsites showed an effective discrimination of CHD and stroke cases without \nhypertension from controls [area under curve (AUC) = 0.78 and 0.75, \nrespectively].\nCONCLUSIONS: This study presents a strong association of altered HYAL2 \nmethylation in peripheral blood with preclinical CHD and stroke, providing a \nnovel biomarker for risk assessment and early detection of cardiovascular \ndiseases.\n\n© 2024.

While some patient and treatment related factors are known to \ncontribute to the incidence and severity of disease, reliable biomarkers remain \nelusive. In the following study, we investigated the association of salivary DNA \nmethylation derived biological aging, cellular frequency and protein \nconcentration measures with the severity of oral mucositis and overall survival \nin a cohort of head and neck cancer (HNC) patients (n = 103).\nMETHODS: DNA methylation profiling was performed on saliva samples obtained \nprior to treatment. Biological aging measures included Horvath2, PhenoAge, \nFitAge and GrimAge, and cellular frequency included epithelial and specific \nimmune cell populations.\nRESULTS: Severe mucositis (i.e. grade 3 or 4) occurred in nearly half of \npatients. For malignant HNC patients (n = 84), every 1-SD increase in GrimAge \nwas associated with 2.62-times risk of severe mucositis (95 % CI: 1.38, 5.57), \nwhile a 1-SD increase in monocyte frequency was associated with a decreased risk \n(OR [95 %CI]: 0.40 [0.18, 0.80]). Over a median follow-up of 53 months, 39 of \n103 participants died. Six protein scores (TNFSF14, GCSF, MATN3, GDF8, nCDase, \nTNF-β) were associated with survival at q < 0.15.\nCONCLUSION: We provide evidence that the risk-related biological aging measure \nGrimAge may be a useful predictor of mucositis severity in HNC patients. \nSalivary monocyte frequency may be protective against mucositis, and this \nmeasure could be used as a predictive biomarker while also providing clues into \nthe pathobiology of the disease.\n\nCopyright © 2024 The Authors.

Numerous studies have shown that DNA \nmethylation is a crucial factor in epigenetic modifications and regulation of \ncarcinogenesis.\nMETHODS: HCC patient data were sourced from the TCGA dataset as a training set, \nwhile GSE116174 was used as an external validation set for verification. \nDifferential methylation and expression analyses were performed on HCC samples \nwith and without extrahepatic metastasis. In the intersecting genes, the \nrelationship between methylation and expression levels of the intersecting genes \nwas analyzed. Genes with a correlation coefficient≥|0.30| and P<0.05 were \nidentified as methylation driver genes. Cox regression analysis was conducted to \nidentify genes associated with HCC prognosis and establish a risk score. \nSubsequently, a prognostic model was established and validated using Cox \nregression analysis incorporating the risk score and other clinical factors. \nUsing immunohistochemistry to evaluate the expression of DHX58 and EIF5A2 in HCC \ntissues with and without extrahepatic metastasis. Immunoinfiltration analysis \nwas performed on the HCC samples using CIBERSORT.\nRESULTS: Our research identified eight methylation driver genes for HCC \nextrahepatic metastasis, of which two genes (DHX58 and EIF5A2) were associated \nwith HCC patient prognosis. And the study further constructed and validated the \nrisk score and prognostic model.

Recent studies have reported that squalene epoxidase (SQLE) \nis overexpressed in several cancers, which contributes to cancer development.\nMETHODS: RNA sequencing data for SQLE were obtained from The Cancer Genome \nAtlas. In vitro experiments, including colorimetry, colony formation, Transwell, \nRT-qPCR, and Western blotting were performed. Furthermore, a transplanted CESC \nnude mouse model was constructed to validate the tumorigenic activity of SQLE in \nvivo. Associations among the SQLE expression profiles, differentially expressed \ngenes (DEGs), immune infiltration, and chemosensitivity were examined. The \nprognostic value of genetic changes and DNA methylation in SQLE were also \nassessed.\nRESULTS: SQLE mRNA expression was significantly increased in CESC. ROC analysis \nrevealed the strong diagnostic ability of SQLE toward CESC. Patients with high \nSQLE expression experienced shorter overall survival. The promotional effects of \nSQLE on cancer cell proliferation, metastasis, cholesterol synthesis, and EMT \nwere emphasized. DEGs functional enrichment analysis revealed the signaling \npathways and biological processes. Notably, a connection existed between the \nSQLE expression and the presence of immune cells as well as the activation of \nimmune checkpoints. Increased SQLE expressions exhibited increased \nchemotherapeutic responses. SQLE methylation status was significantly associated \nwith CESC prognosis.\nCONCLUSION: SQLE significantly affects CESC prognosis, malignant behavior, \ncholesterol synthesis, EMT, and immune infiltration; thereby offering diagnostic \nand indicator roles in CESC. Thus, SQLE can be a novel therapeutic target in \nCESC treatment.\n\n© 2024.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying HDS-induced \ncancer progression are not completely understood. We found that \nphosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (PEPCK1), a pivotal enzyme in \ngluconeogenesis, is paradoxically upregulated in tumors by HDS, but not by \nnormal dietary sugar (NDS), during tumor progression. Targeted knockdown of \npepck1, but not pepck2, specifically in tumor tissue in Drosophila in vivo, not \nonly attenuates HDS-induced tumor growth but also significantly improves the \nsurvival of Ras/Src tumor-bearing animals fed HDS. Interestingly, HP1a-mediated \nheterochromatin interacts directly with the pepck1 gene and downregulates pepck1 \ngene expression in wild-type Drosophila. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that, \nunder HDS conditions, pepck1 knockdown reduces both wingless and TOR signaling, \ndecreases evasion of apoptosis, reduces genome instability, and suppresses \nglucose uptake and trehalose levels in tumor cells in vivo. Moreover, rational \npharmacological inhibition of PEPCK1, using hydrazinium sulfate, greatly \nimproves the survival of tumor-bearing animals with pepck1 knockdown under HDS. \nThis study is the first to show that elevated levels of dietary sugar induce \naberrant upregulation of PEPCK1, which promotes tumor progression through \naltered cell signaling, evasion of apoptosis, genome instability, and \nreprogramming of carbohydrate metabolism. These findings contribute to our \nunderstanding of the complex relationship between diet and cancer at the \nmolecular, cellular, and organismal levels and reveal PEPCK1 as a potential \ntarget for the prevention and treatment of cancers associated with metabolic \ndisorders.\n\n© 2024.

Evidence indicates that small molecules in RJ can \nmodulate gene expression in mammalian cells, such as the fatty acid \n10-hydroxy-2-decenoic acid (10-HDA), previously associated with the inhibition \nof histone deacetylase enzymes (HDACs). Therefore, we combined computational \n(molecular docking simulations) and experimental approaches for the screening of \npotential HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) among 32 RJ-derived fatty acids. Biochemical \nassays and gene expression analyses (Reverse Transcriptase - quantitative \nPolymerase Chain Reaction) were performed to evaluate the functional effects of \nthe major RJ fatty acids, 10-HDA and 10-HDAA (10-hydroxy-decanoic acid), in two \nhuman cancer cell lines (HCT116 and MDA-MB-231). The molecular docking \nsimulations indicate that these fatty acids might interact with class I HDACs, \nspecifically with the catalytic domain of human HDAC2, likewise well-known HDAC \ninhibitors (HDACi) such as SAHA (suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid) and TSA \n(Trichostatin A). In addition, the combined treatment with 10-HDA and 10-HDAA \ninhibits the activity of human nuclear HDACs and leads to a slight increase in \nthe expression of HDAC-coding genes in cancer cells. Our findings indicate that \nroyal jelly fatty acids collectively contribute to HDAC inhibition and that \n10-HDA and 10-HDAA are weak HDACi that facilitate the acetylation of lysine \nresidues of chromatin, triggering an increase in gene expression levels in \ncancer cells.\n\nDOI: 10.1080/15592294.2024.2400423\nPMCID: PMC11404605\nPMID: 39255363 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: No potential conflict of interest was reported \nby the author(s)."

Mapping of \nthe epigenetic and translational landscape demonstrates that H2afy deletion \npromotes cell transition to a mesenchymal-like state. With a multiomics \napproach, we uncovered H2AFY-associated genes that are functionally relevant and \nprognostic in patients.

However, NSCLC has developed resistance to this drug, which limits \nthe therapeutic effect and thus affects prognosis. NSCLC sc-RNA-seq data were \ndownloaded from the GEO database and Ku Leuven Laboratory for Functional \nEpigenetics, and bulk RNA-seq data were obtained from the TCGA database. The \n\"Seurat\" package was employed for scRNA-seq data processing, and the uniform \nmanifold approximation and projection (UMAP) were applied for downscaling and \ncluster identification. Use the FindAllMarkers function to find differential \ngenes (DEGs) for tumor stem cells. Then, we performed univariate regression \nanalyses on the DEGs to identify potential prognostic genes. We created a \nmachine learning framework based on potential prognostic genes, which combines \n10 machine learning methods and their 101 combinations to get the optimal \nprognostic risk model. The model was evaluated in the training set and \nvalidation set. A nomogram was developed to provide physicians with a \nquantitative tool for prognosis prediction. Finally, we evaluated the expression \nand functionality of SLC2A1. We discovered 22 cell clusters containing 218379 \ncells by examining single-cell RNA sequencing datasets (GSE148071, KU_lom, \nGSE131907, GSE136246, GSE127465). Tumour cells were isolated for subpopulation \nanalysis and 162 differential genes from SOX2_cancer were obtained. After \nunivariate Cox analysis, we found 23 genes with prognostic potential prognostic \nvalue and utilized them to develop 101‑combination machine learning \ncomputational framework. We eventually picked the best performing \n'StepCox[both] + RSF', which includes 8 genes. The model has a relatively high \nprediction accuracy in both TCGA and GEO datasets. In in vitro investigations, \ntargeted suppression of the SLC2A1 gene resulted in significant reductions in \nproliferation, invasion and migration in A549 cells. In addition, a significant \nreduction in cisplatin resistance was seen in A549/DDP cells. The outcomes \ndemonstrated the precision and credibility of the prognostic model for NSCLC, \nhighlighting its potential significance in the treatment and prognosis of \nindividuals affected by this disease. SLC2A1 may become a promising prognostic \nmarker and a potential therapeutic target, offering valuable insights to inform \nclinical treatment decisions.\n\n© 2024.

To comprehensively capture \nthe molecular diversity of human pancreatic cancer, we here profiled 65 \npatient-derived pancreatic cancer organoid lines, including six adenosquamous \ncarcinoma lines. H3K27me3-mediated erasure of the ductal lineage specifiers and \nhijacking of the TP63-driven squamous-cell programme drove squamous-cell \ncommitment, providing survival benefit in a Wnt-deficient environment and \nhypoxic conditions. Gene engineering of normal pancreatic duct organoids \nrevealed that GATA6 loss and a Wnt-deficient environment, in concert with \ngenetic or hypoxia-mediated inactivation of KDM6A, facilitate squamous \nreprogramming, which in turn enhances environmental fitness. EZH2 inhibition \ncounterbalanced the epigenetic bias and curbed the growth of adenosquamous \ncancer organoids. Our results demonstrate how an adversarial microenvironment \ndictates the molecular and histological evolution of human pancreatic cancer and \nprovide insights into the principles and significance of lineage conversion in \nhuman cancer.\n\n© 2024.

Unraveling this \nvariation will bring about improved staging and treatment outcomes. Hence, \nmotivated by the advancement of Deep Neural Network (DNN) libraries and \ncomplementary factors within some genomics datasets, we aggregate atypia \npatterns in histopathological images with diverse carcinogenic expression from \nmRNA, miRNA and DNA methylation as an integrative input source into a deep \nneural network for colon cancer stages classification, and samples \nstratification into low or high-risk survival groups.\nRESULTS: The genomics-only and integrated input features return Area Under \nCurve-Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.97 compared with \nAUC-ROC of 0.78 obtained when only image features are used for the stage's \nclassification. A further analysis of prediction accuracy using the confusion \nmatrix shows that the integrated features have a weakly improved accuracy of \n0.08% more than the accuracy obtained with genomics features. Also, the \nextracted features were used to split the patients into low or high-risk \nsurvival groups.

The role of the \ncircadian clock as a regulator of liver physiology and disease is well \nestablished in rodents, however, the identity and epigenetic regulation of \nrhythmically expressed genes in human disease is less well studied. Here we \nunravel the rhythmic transcriptome and epigenome of human hepatocytes using male \nhuman liver chimeric mice. We identify a large number of rhythmically expressed \nprotein coding genes in human hepatocytes of male chimeric mice, which includes \nkey transcription factors, chromatin modifiers, and critical enzymes. We show \nthat hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, a major cause of liver disease and \ncancer, perturbs the transcriptome by altering the rhythmicity of the expression \nof more than 1000 genes, and affects the epigenome, leading to an activation of \ncritical pathways mediating metabolic alterations, fibrosis, and cancer. \nHCV-perturbed rhythmic pathways remain dysregulated in patients with advanced \nliver disease.

However, the intricate relationships between cellular senescence-related \n(CSR) genes and cancer risk remain poorly explored, with insights on causality \nremaining elusive. In this study, Mendelian Randomization (MR) analyses were \nused to draw causal inferences from 866 CSR genes as exposures and summary \nstatistics for 18 common cancers as outcomes. We focused on genetic variants \naffecting gene expression, DNA methylation, and protein expression quantitative \ntrait loci (cis-eQTL, cis-mQTL, and cis-pQTL, respectively), which were strongly \nlinked to CSR genes alterations. Variants were selected as instrumental \nvariables (IVs) and analyzed for causality with cancer using both \nsummary-data-based MR (SMR) and two-sample MR (TSMR) approaches. Bayesian \ncolocalization was used to unravel potential regulatory mechanisms underpinning \nrisk variants in cancer, and further validate the robustness of MR results. We \nidentified five CSR genes (CNOT6, DNMT3B, MAP2K1, TBPL1, and SREBF1), 18 DNA \nmethylation genes, and LAYN protein expression which were all causally \nassociated with different cancer types. Beyond causality, a comprehensive \nanalysis of gene function, pathways, and druggability values was also conducted. \nThese findings provide a robust foundation for unravelling CSR genes molecular \nmechanisms and promoting clinical drug development for cancer.\n\n© 2024.

To gain insight into the \nmechanisms of MetD progression, we focused on DNA methylation and functional \nanalyses on intragenic regions of two MetD risk genes, the glucokinase (GCK) \nexon 7 and the transmembrane 6 superfamily 2 (TM6SF2) intron 2-exon 3 boundary, \nwhich harbor non-B DNA motifs for G4s and R-loops.Pyrosequencing of 148 blood \nsamples from a nested cohort study revealed significant differential methylation \nin GCK and TM6SF2 in MetD patients versus healthy controls. Furthermore, these \nregions harbor hypervariable and differentially methylated CpGs also in \nhepatocellular carcinoma versus normal tissue samples from The Cancer Genome \nAtlas (TCGA). Permanganate/S1 nuclease footprinting with direct adapter ligation \n(PDAL-Seq), native polyacrylamide DNA gel electrophoresis and circular dichroism \n(CD) spectroscopy revealed the formation of G4 structures in these regions and \ndemonstrated that their topology and stability is affected by DNA methylation. \nDetailed analyses including histone marks, chromatin conformation capture data, \nand luciferase reporter assays, highlighted the cell-type specific regulatory \nfunction of the target regions. Based on our analyses, we hypothesize that \nchanges in DNA methylation lead to topological changes, especially in GCK exon \n7, and cause the activation of alternative regulatory elements or potentially \nplay a role in alternative splicing.Our analyses provide a new view on the \nmechanisms underlying the progression of MetDs and their link to hepatocellular \ncarcinomas, unveiling non-B DNA structures as important key players already in \nearly disease stages.\n\n© 2024.

This preliminary study investigates the impact \nof a 16-week online supervised physical activity (PA) intervention on biological \nage in post-surgery female BC patients. Telomere length was measured using qPCR, \nand the ELOVL2-based epigenetic clock was assessed via DNA methylation \npyrosequencing of the ELOVL2 promoter region. Telomere length remained \nunchanged, but the ELOVL2 epigenetic clock indicated a significant decrease in \nbiological age in the PA group, suggesting the potential of PA interventions to \nreverse accelerated aging processes in BC survivors. The exercise group showed \nimproved cardiovascular fitness, highlighting PA's health impact. Finally, the \nreduction in biological age, as measured by the ELOVL2 epigenetic clock, was \nsignificantly associated with improvements in cardiovascular fitness and \nhandgrip strength, supporting improved recovery. Epigenetic clocks can \npotentially assess health status and recovery progress in BC patients, \nidentifying at-risk individuals in clinical practice. This study provides \npotential and valuable insights into how PA benefits BC survivors' health, \nsupporting the immediate benefits of a 16-week exercise intervention in \nmitigating accelerated aging. The findings could suggest a holistic approach to \nimproving the health and recovery of post-surgery BC patients.\n\nDOI: 10.3390/ijms25168596\nPMCID: PMC11355047\nPMID: 39201283 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: Ibañez-Cabellos, J.S. is an employee of \nEpiDisease S.L., a Center for Biomedical Network Research of Spain spin-off for \ndeveloping products and services based on epigenetics.

Here, we show that sodium chloride (NaCl) counteracts T cell \ndysfunction to promote cancer regression. NaCl supplementation during CD8+ \nT cell culture induced effector differentiation, IFN-γ production and \ncytotoxicity while maintaining the gene networks responsible for stem-like \nplasticity. Accordingly, adoptive transfer of tumor-specific T cells resulted in \nsuperior anti-tumor immunity in a humanized mouse model. In mice, a high-salt \ndiet reduced the growth of experimental tumors in a CD8+ T cell-dependent manner \nby inhibiting terminal differentiation and enhancing the effector potency of \nCD8+ T cells. Mechanistically, NaCl enhanced glutamine consumption, which was \ncritical for transcriptional, epigenetic and functional reprogramming. In \nhumans, CD8+ T cells undergoing antigen recognition in tumors and predicting \nfavorable responses to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy resembled those induced \nby NaCl. Thus, NaCl metabolism is a regulator of CD8+ T cell effector function, \nwith potential implications for cancer immunotherapy.\n\n© 2024.

Homologous recombination (HR) repair of DNA \ndouble strand break (DSB) plays a crucial role in maintenance of genetic \nstability and cell normal functions. However, whether BaP/BPDE might suppress HR \nrepair in human trophoblast cells to induce miscarriage, as well as its \nepigenetic regulatory mechanism, is largely unclear. In this study, we find that \nBaP/BPDE suppresses HR repair of DSB in trophoblast cells and eventually induces \nmiscarriage by up-regulating lnc-HZ08. In mechanism, lnc-HZ08 (1) down-regulates \nthe expression levels of FOXA1 (forkhead box A1) and thus suppresses \nFOXA1-mediated mRNA transcription of BRCA1 (Breast cancer susceptibility gene 1) \nand CtIP (CtBP-interacting protein), (2) impairs BRCA1 and CtIP protein \ninteractions by competitive binding with CtIP through lnc-HZ08-1 fragment, and \nalso (3) suppresses BRCA1-mediated CtIP ubiquitination without affecting CtIP \nstability, three of which eventually suppress HR repair in human trophoblast \ncells. Supplement with murine Ctip could efficiently restore (i.e. increase) HR \nrepair and alleviate miscarriage in BaP-exposed mouse model. Collectively, this \nstudy not only reveals the association and causality among BaP/BPDE exposure, \nthe defective HR repair, and miscarriage, but also discovers novel mechanism in \nlnc-HZ08-regulated BRCA1/CtIP-mediated HR repair, bridging epigenetic regulation \nand genetic instability and also providing an efficient approach for treatment \nagainst BaP/BPDE-induced unexplained miscarriage.\n\nCopyright © 2024 The Author(s).

Transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) signaling via \nactivation and cooperative action of canonical, SMAD, and non-canonical, \nMAP-kinase (MAPK) pathways, elicits both anti- and pro-tumorigenic properties, \nincluding cell stemness and invasiveness. TGFβ activates the ΔNp63 \ntranscriptional program in cancer cells; however, the link between TGFβ and p63 \nin unmasking the epigenetic landscape during tumor progression allowing \nchromatin accessibility and gene transcription, is not yet reported.\nMETHODS: Small molecule inhibitors, including protein kinase inhibitors and \nRNA-silencing, provided loss of function analyses. Sphere formation assays in \ncancer cells, chromatin immunoprecipitation and mRNA expression assays were \nutilized in order to gain mechanistic evidence. Mass spectrometry analysis \ncoupled to co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed novel p63 interactors and \ntheir involvement in p63-dependent transcription.\nRESULTS: The sphere-forming capacity of breast cancer cells was enhanced upon \nTGFβ stimulation and significantly decreased upon ΔNp63 depletion. Activation of \nTGFβ signaling via p38 MAPK signaling induced ΔNp63 phosphorylation at Ser 66/68 \nresulting in stabilized ΔNp63 protein with enhanced DNA binding properties. TGFβ \nstimulation altered the ratio of H3K27ac and H3K27me3 histone modification \nmarks, pointing towards higher H3K27ac and increased p300 acetyltransferase \nrecruitment to chromatin. By silencing the expression of ΔNp63, the TGFβ effect \non chromatin remodeling was abrogated. Inhibition of H3K27me3, revealed the \nimportant role of TGFβ as the upstream signal for guiding ΔNp63 to the TGFβ/SMAD \ngene loci, as well as the indispensable role of ΔNp63 in recruiting histone \nmodifying enzymes, such as p300, to these genomic regions, regulating chromatin \naccessibility and gene transcription. Mechanistically, TGFβ through SMAD \nactivation induced dissociation of ΔNp63 from NURD or NCOR/SMRT histone \ndeacetylation complexes, while promoted the assembly of ΔNp63-p300 complexes, \naffecting the levels of histone acetylation and the outcome of ΔNp63-dependent \ntranscription.\nCONCLUSIONS: ΔNp63, phosphorylated and recruited by TGFβ to the TGFβ/SMAD/ΔNp63 \ngene loci, promotes chromatin accessibility and transcription of target genes \nrelated to stemness and cell invasion.\n\n© 2024.

The aim of this study was to explore the clinical performance of DNA \nmethylation markers and high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) in cervicovaginal \nself-samples and urine for the detection of recurrent cervical cancer. Cervical \ncancer patients without recurrence (n = 47) collected cervicovaginal \nself-samples and urine pre- and posttreatment. Additionally, 20 patients with \nrecurrent cervical cancer collected cervicovaginal self-samples and urine at \ntime of recurrence. All samples were self-collected at home and tested for DNA \nmethylation and high-risk HPV DNA by PCR. In patients without recurrent cervical \ncancer, DNA methylation levels decreased 2-years posttreatment compared to \npretreatment in cervicovaginal self-samples (p < .0001) and urine (p < .0001). \nDNA methylation positivity in cervicovaginal self-samples was more frequently \nobserved in patients with recurrence (77.8%) than in patients without recurrence \n2-years posttreatment (25.5%; p = .0004). Also in urine, DNA methylation \npositivity was more frequently observed in patients with recurrence (65%) \ncompared to those without recurrence (35.6%; p = .038). Similarly, high-risk HPV \npositivity in both cervicovaginal self-samples and urine was more frequent \n(52.6% and 55%, respectively) in patients with recurrence compared to patients \nwithout recurrence (14.9% and 8.5%, respectively) (p = .004 and p = .0001). In \nconclusion, this study shows the potential of posttreatment monitoring of \ncervical cancer patients for recurrence by DNA methylation and high-risk HPV \ntesting in cervicovaginal and urine samples collected at home. The highest \nrecurrence detection rate was achieved by DNA methylation testing in \ncervicovaginal self-samples, detecting 77.8% of all recurrences and, \nspecifically, 100% of the local recurrences.\n\n© 2024 The Author(s).

Epigenetic \nalterations, particularly aberrant DNA methylation in genes, such as MIR124-3, \nMIR34b/c, NKX6-1, EMX1, MOS and CDO1, have been identified as promising \nbiomarkers for MGL in Asian populations. We aimed to determine whether these \nchanges could predict MGL risk in intermediate-risk Caucasian patients.\nMETHODS: This case-cohort study included 36 patients who developed MGL matched \nto 48 patients without evidence of MGL in the same time frame (controls). \nMultiplex quantitative methylation-specific PCR was performed using DNA \nextracted from the normal mucosa adjacent to the primary lesion. The overall \nrisk of progression to MGL was assessed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional \nhazards model analyses.\nRESULTS: MIR124-3, MIR34b/c and NKX6-1 were successfully analyzed in 77 samples. \nMIR124-3 hypermethylation was detected in individuals who developed MGL \n(relative quantification 78.8 vs 50.5 in controls, p = 0.014), particularly in \nfemales and Helicobacter pylori-negative patients (p = 0.021 and p = 0.0079, \nrespectively). This finding was further associated with a significantly greater \nrisk for MGL development (aHR = 2.31, 95% CI 1.03-5.17, p = 0.042). Similarly, \nNKX6-1 was found to be hypermethylated in patients with synchronous lesions \n(relative quantification 7.9 vs 0.0 in controls, p = 0.0026). A molecular-based \nmethylation model incorporating both genes was significantly associated with a \nthreefold increased risk for MGL development (aHR = 3.10, 95% CI 1.07-8.95, \np = 0.037).\nCONCLUSIONS: This preliminary study revealed an association between MIR124-3 and \nNKX6-1 hypermethylation and the development of MGL in a Western population. \nThese findings may represent a burden reduction and a greener approach to \npatient care.\n\n© 2024.

This study aims to discern DNA methylation \nprobes associated with exposure to multiple pollutants, serving as early effect \nmarkers, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as surrogate indicators for \npopulation susceptibility. The investigation involved the analysis of urine \nexposure biomarkers for 11 heavy metals (vanadium, arsenic, mercury, cadmium, \nchromium, nickel, lead, manganese, copper, strontium, thallium), polycyclic \naromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs) (1-hydroxypyrene), genome-wide DNA methylation \nsequencing, and SNPs array on all study participants. The data were integrated \nwith metabolomics information and analyzed both at a community level based on \nproximity to home addresses relative to the complex and at an individual level \nbased on exposure biomarker concentrations.\nRESULTS: On a community level, 67 exposure-related CpG probes were identified, \nwhile 70 CpG probes were associated with urine arsenic concentration, 2 with \nmercury, and 46 with vanadium on an individual level. These probes were \nannotated to genes implicated in cancers and chronic kidney disease. Weighted \nquantile sum regression analysis revealed that vanadium, mercury, and \n1-hydroxypyrene contributed the most to cg08238319 hypomethylation. cg08238319 \nis annotated to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor (AHRR) gene, and AHRR \nhypomethylation was correlated with an elevated risk of lung cancer. AHRR was \nfurther linked to deregulations in phenylalanine metabolism, alanine, aspartate, \nand glutamate metabolism, along with heightened oxidative stress. Additionally, \nthree SNPs (rs11085020, rs199442, and rs10947050) corresponding to \nexposure-related CpG probes exhibited significant interaction effects with \nmultiple heavy metals and PAHs exposure, and have been implicated in cancer \nprogression and respiratory diseases.\nCONCLUSION: Our findings underscore the pivotal role of AHRR methylation in \ngene-environment interactions and highlight SNPs that could potentially serve as \nindicators of population susceptibility in regions exposed to multiple heavy \nmetals and PAHs.\n\n© 2024.

Epigenome-wide DNA methylation patterns in tumor DNA were \nassessed using the human Illumina Methylation EPIC V1 array.\nRESULTS: Around 5,139 differentially methylated CpG-sites (q < 0.01, lΔβl > 0.2) \nwere identified when comparing normal vs. tumor, with an overall trend of \nhypermethylation in prostate tumors.  Multiple representative differentially \nmethylated regions (DMRs), including immune-related genes, such as CD40, \nGalectin3, OX40L, and STING, were detected in prostate tumors when compared to \nadjacent normal tissues. Based on an epigenetic clock model, we observed that \ntumors' total number of stem cell divisions and the stem cell division rate were \nsignificantly higher than adjacent normal tissues. Regarding PCa aggressiveness, \n2,061 differentially methylated CpG-sites (q < 0.05, lΔβl > .05) were identified \nwhen the grade group (GG)1 was compared with GG4/5. Among these 2,061 CpG sites, \n155 probes were consistently significant in more than one comparison. Among \nthese genes, several immune system genes, such as COL18A1, S100A2, ITGA4, HLA-C, \nand ADCYAP1, have previously been linked to tumor progression in PCa.\nCONCLUSION: Several differentially methylated genes involved in immune-oncologic \npathways associated with disease risk or aggressiveness were identified. In \naddition, 261 African American-specific differentially methylated genes related \nto the risk of PCa were identified. These results can shedlight on potential \nmechanisms contributing to PCa disparities in the African American Population.\n\n© 2024 The Author(s).

HPV \nassociated virus integration sites (VISs) were analysed using the ViMIC \ndatabase. From September 2020 to August 2021, the 70 HPV-16 positive cases \nretrospectively collected from multi-centre cohorts were subjected to HPV-16 E6 \ndeep sequencing and PCR-based host gene (ASTN1, DLX1, ITGA4, RXFP3, SOX17, \nZNF671) methylation detection. RNAseq and expression validation (NNF671) were \nperformed in C-33A cell line harbouring HPV D32E. Lasso and logistic regression \nalgorithm were used to construct the CC diagnostic model.\nRESULTS: A positive correlation was observed between the average methylation \nlevel of CC patients and their pathological features including tumour stage \n(p = 0.0077) and HPV subtype (p < 0.001). ZNF671 was identified as a CC-specific \nmethylation marker, with an impressive 93% sensitivity. Both HPV-16 D32E \nmutation and integration of HPV-16 down-regulated the ZNF671 expression. \nFinally, a CC diagnostic nomogram was developed by integrating ZNF671 \nmethylation level and HPV E6 mutation feature, yielding an exceptional AUC of \n0.997 (95% CI: 0.934-1.000).\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated HPV viral mutations are closely related to \nhost gene epigenetic alterations in CC. Integration of the viral and host \ngenetic information might be a new promising strategy for CC screening.\n\nDOI: 10.1080/23744235.2024.2391538\nPMID: 39154329 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

This comprehensive \nbioinformatics study transcends traditional boundaries, investigating the \nprognostic and therapeutic potential of S100A9 across diverse neoplastic \nentities. Leveraging a wide array of bioinformatics tools and publicly available \ncancer genomics databases, such as TCGA, we systematically examined the S100A9 \ngene. Our approach included differential expression analysis, mutational burden \nassessment, protein interaction networks, and survival analysis. This robust \ncomputational framework provided a high-resolution view of S100A9's role in \ncancer biology. The study meticulously explored S100A9's oncogenic facets, \nincorporating comprehensive analyses of its relationship with prognosis, tumor \nmutational burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI), DNA methylation, and \nimmune cell infiltration across various tumor types. This study presents a \npanoramic view of S100A9 expression across a spectrum of human cancers, \nrevealing a heterogeneous expression landscape. Elevated S100A9 expression was \ndetected in malignancies such as BLCA (Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma), CESC \n(Cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma), COAD (Colon \nadenocarcinoma), ESCA (Esophageal carcinoma), and GBM (Glioblastoma multiforme), \nwhile reduced expression was noted in BRCA (Breast invasive carcinoma), HNSC \n(Head and Neck squamous cell carcinoma), and KICH (Kidney Chromophobe). This \ndisparate expression pattern suggests that S100A9's role in cancer biology is \nmultifaceted and context-dependent. Prognostically, S100A9 expression correlates \nvariably with patient outcomes across different cancer types. Furthermore, its \nexpression is intricately associated with TMB and MSI in nine cancer types. \nDetailed examination of six selected tumors-BRCA, CESC, KIRC (Kidney renal clear \ncell carcinoma), LUSC (Lung squamous cell carcinoma), SKCM (Skin Cutaneous \nMelanoma); STAD (Stomach adenocarcinoma)-revealed a negative correlation of \nS100A9 expression with the infiltration of most immune cells, but a positive \ncorrelation with neutrophils, M1 macrophages, and activated NK cells, \nhighlighting the complex interplay between S100A9 and the tumor immune \nenvironment. This bioinformatics synthesis posits S100A9 as a significant player \nin cancer progression, offering valuable prognostic insights. The data \nunderscore the utility of S100A9 as a prognostic biomarker and its potential as \na therapeutic target. The therapeutic implications are profound, suggesting that \nmodulation of S100A9 activity could significantly impact cancer management \nstrategies.\n\n© 2024.

Risk stratification of PNs is \nessential for detecting early-stage lung cancer while minimizing the \noverdiagnosis of benign nodules. This study aimed to develop a circulating tumor \nDNA (ctDNA) methylation-based, non-invasive model for the risk stratification of \nPNs.\nMETHODS: A blood-based assay (\"LUNG-TRAC\") was designed to include novel lung \ncancer ctDNA methylation markers identified from in-house reduced representative \nbisulfite sequencing data and known markers from the literature. A \nstratification model was trained based on 183 ctDNA samples derived from \npatients with benign or malignant PNs and validated in 62 patients. LUNG-TRAC \nwas further single-blindly tested in a single- and multi-center cohort.\nRESULTS: The LUNG-TRAC model achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.810 \n(sensitivity = 74.4 % and specificity = 73.7 %) in the validation set. Two test \nsets were used to evaluate the performance of LUNG-TRAC, with an AUC of 0.815 in \nthe single-center test (N = 61; sensitivity = 67.5 % and specificity = 76.2 %) \nand 0.761 in the multi-center test (N = 95; sensitivity = 50.7 % and \nspecificity = 80.8 %). The clinical utility of LUNG-TRAC was further assessed by \ncomparing it to two established risk stratification models: the Mayo Clinic and \nVeteran Administration models. It outperformed both in the validation and the \nsingle-center test sets.\nCONCLUSION: The LUNG-TRAC model demonstrated accuracy and consistency in \nstratifying PNs for the risk of malignancy, suggesting its utility as a \nnon-invasive diagnostic aid for early-stage peripheral lung cancer.\nCLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: www.\nCLINICALTRIALS: gov (NCT03989219).\n\nCopyright © 2024 The Authors.

Electronic \naddress: ychen88@sina.com.\n\nN-Methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) and Helicobacter pylori might \nsynergistically promote the malignant transformation of human esophageal \nepithelial cells (HEECs) through inducing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and \ninhibition of PAXX protein expression. The long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) TUG1 is \nassociated with multiple cancers, and its overexpression can promote cancer by \ninterfering with the functions of oncogenes. LncRNA TUG1 is also associated with \nDNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and the epithelial signaling pathway of H. \npylori infection. To explore the role of LncRNA TUG1 in the malignant \ntransformation of HEECs induced by H.pylori + MNNG, a stable strain of HEECs \nwith LncRNA TUG1 knockdown (LncRNA TUG1-KD) was constructed using RNA \ninterference technology with lentivirus as a vector. Set up negative controls \nLncRNA TUG1-NC (null carrier lentivirus was selected to transfect HEECs) and \nblock controls (normal HEECs without exposure). H. pylori + MNNG were added to \nthe LncRNA TUG1-KD and LncRNA TUG1-NC groups for 6 h and then passaged until \ntheir malignant transformation. From each group, cells in the early, \nintermediate, and late stages of malignant transformation were used for the \nalkaline comet assay and determination of protein expression, including γ-H2AX \nand PAXX, by western blotting assay to assess DNA damage and repair processes. \nClone formation assay in soft agar and nude mouse xenograft model was used to \nassess malignancy. This study suggests that H. pylori + MNNG promotes the \nmalignant transformation of HEECs by inducing DNA DSBs and inhibiting PAXX \nexpression, and this effect may be alleviated by LncRNA TUG1 knockdown. It \nelucidates the pathogenesis of EC from the perspective of the combined effect of \nepigenetic and environmental carcinogens, offering new insights for the \ncomprehensive prevention and treatment of EC.\n\nCopyright © 2024 Elsevier Ltd.

Assessing the future risk of neoplastic progression in patients with BE \nis difficult; however, high-grade dysplasia (HGD) and early EAC are treatable by \nendoscopic eradication therapy (EET), with survival rates of 90%. Thus, it would \nbe beneficial to develop a molecular assay to identify high-risk patients, who \nmerit more frequent endoscopic surveillance or EET, as well as low-risk \npatients, who can avoid EET and undergo less frequent surveillance.\nMETHODS: Deidentified endoscopic biopsies were acquired from 240 patients with \nBE at 6 centers and confirmed as future progressors or nonprogressors. Tissues \nwere analyzed by a set of methylation-specific biomarker assays. Test \nperformance was assessed in an independent validation set using 4 stratification \nlevels: low risks, low-moderate risks, high-moderate risks, and high risks.\nRESULTS: Relative to patients in the low-risk group, high-risk patients were \n15.2 times more likely to progress within 5 years to HGD or EAC. For patients in \nthe high-risk category, the average risk of progressing to HGD or EAC within 5 \nyears was 21.5%, 4-fold the BE population prevalence within 5 years, whereas \nlow-risk patients had a progression risk of only 1.85%.\nDISCUSSION: This clinical assay, Esopredict, stratifies future neoplastic \nprogression risk to identify higher-risk patients with BE who can benefit from \nEET or more frequent surveillance and lower-risk patients who can benefit from \nreduced surveillance.\n\nCopyright © 2024 The Author(s).

However, multiple challenges persist, notably in controlling \ntumor cell plasticity in patients with refractory and metastatic illness. \nNeuroblastoma (NB) is an aggressive pediatric malignancy originating from \ndefective differentiation of neural crest-derived progenitors with oncogenic \nactivity due to genetic and epigenetic alterations and remains a clinical \nchallenge for high-risk patients. To identify critical genes driving NB \naggressiveness, we performed combined chromatin and transcriptome analyses on \nmatched patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), spheroids, and differentiated \nadherent cultures derived from metastatic MYCN nonamplified tumors. Bone marrow \nkinase on chromosome X (BMX) was identified among the most differentially \nregulated genes in PDXs and spheroids versus adherent models. BMX expression \ncorrelated with high tumor stage and poor patient survival and was crucial to \nthe maintenance of the self-renewal and tumorigenic potential of NB spheroids. \nMoreover, BMX expression positively correlated with the mesenchymal NB cell \nphenotype, previously associated with increased chemoresistance. Finally, BMX \ninhibitors readily reversed this cellular state, increased the sensitivity of NB \nspheroids toward chemotherapy, and partially reduced tumor growth in a \npreclinical NB model. Altogether, our study identifies BMX as a promising \ninnovative therapeutic target for patients with high-risk MYCN nonamplified NB.\n\nDOI: 10.1172/jci.insight.169647\nPMCID: PMC11383371\nPMID: 39133652 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

The role of YTH \nN6-methyladenosine RNA binding protein F3 (YTHDF3), an m6A reader in HCC, \nrequires further investigation. Here, we aim to explore the biological \nproperties of YTHDF3 in HCC and its potential mechanisms. The predictive risk \nmodel for HCC was developed by analyzing the expression of genes associated with \nm6A in HCC using online datasets. WB and qPCR were employed to assess YTHDF3 \nexpression in HCC and its correlation with the disease's clinicopathological \ncharacteristics. Both in vitro and in vivo methods were utilized to evaluate the \nbiological effects of YTHDF3 in HCC. The potential targets of YTHDF3 were \nidentified and confirmed using RNA-seq, meRIP-seq, and linear amplification and \nsequencing of cDNA ends (Lace-seq). We confirmed that YTHDF3 is overexpressed in \nHCC. Patients with higher YTHDF3 expression had a greater risk of cancer \nrecurrence. In both in vitro and in vivo settings, YTHDF3 boosts the migration \nand invasion capabilities of HCC cells. Through multi-omics research, we \nidentified YTHDF3's downstream target genes as NKD inhibitors of the WNT \nsignaling pathway 1 (NKD1) and the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway. With m6A \nmodification, YTHDF3 suppresses the transcription and translation of NKD1. \nAdditionally, NKD1 inhibited tumor growth by blocking the WNT/β-catenin \nsignaling pathway. The investigation found that the oncogene YTHDF3 stimulates \nthe WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway by m6A-dependently suppressing NKD1 \nexpression in HCC cells. Our findings suggest that YTHDF3 regulates \nhepatocarcinogenesis, providing fresh perspectives on potential biomarkers and \ntherapeutic targets for HCC.\n\nCopyright © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, it is proved that downregulated \nlevel of NSD3 is linked to clinical features and poor survival in lung \nadenocarcinoma. In vivo, NSD3 inhibited the proliferation, immigration, and \ninvasion ability of lung adenocarcinoma. Meanwhile, NSD3 suppressed glycolysis \nby inhibiting HK2 translation, transcription, glucose uptake, and lactate \nproduction in lung adenocarcinoma. Mechanistically, as an intermediary, NSD3 \nbinds to PPP1CB and p-STAT3 in protein levels, thus forming a trimer to \ndephosphorylate the level of p-STAT3 by PPP1CB, leading to the suppression of \nHK2 transcription. Interestingly, the phosphorylation function of PPP1CB is \nrelated to the concentration of carbon dioxide and pH value in the culture \nenvironment. Together, this study revealed the critical non-epigenetic role of \nNSD3 in the regulation of STAT3-dependent glycolysis, providing a piece of \ncompelling evidence for targeting the NSD3/PPP1CB/p-STAT3 in lung \nadenocarcinoma.\n\n© 2024 The Author(s).

Hence, we systematically investigated the associations among POPs \nexposure, genetics and epigenetics and their effects on colorectal cancer. A \ncase-control study was conducted in the Chinese population for detecting POPs \nlevels. We measured the concentrations of 24 POPs in the plasma using gas \nchromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) and evaluated the clinical \nsignificance of POPs by calculating the area under the receiver operating \ncharacteristic curve (AUC). To assess the associations between candidate genetic \nvariants and colorectal cancer risk, unconditional logistic regression was used. \nCompared with healthy control individuals, individuals with colorectal cancer \nexhibited higher concentrations of the majority of POPs. Exposure to PCB153 was \npositively associated with colorectal cancer risk, and PCB153 demonstrated \nsuperior accuracy (AUC=0.72) for predicting colorectal cancer compared to other \nanalytes. On PCB153-related genes, the rs67734009 C allele was significantly \nassociated with reduced colorectal cancer risk and lower plasma levels of \nPCB153. Moreover, rs67734009 exhibited an expression quantitative trait locus \n(eQTL) effect on ESR1, of which the expression level was negatively related to \nPCB153 concentration. Mechanistically, the risk allele of rs67734009 increased \nESR1 expression via miR-3492 binding and m6A modification. Collectively, this \nstudy sheds light on potential genetic and epigenetic mechanisms linking PCB153 \nexposure and colorectal cancer risk, thereby providing insight into the accurate \nprotection against POPs exposure.\n\nCopyright © 2024 The Author(s).

The XRCC2 gene, essential for DNA repair, has been implicated in \ncancer susceptibility. This study aims to evaluate the association between XRCC2 \nand BC risk. The study was conducted at Zheen International Hospital in Erbil, \nIraq, between 2021 and 2024 with a total of 88 samples, including 44 paired \nnormal and cancer tissue samples. Mutation analysis was performed using \nNext-Generation Sequencing, coupled with in silico tools for variant impact \nprediction. Expression levels were assessed through RT-PCR, and methylation \nstatus was determined using methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme digestion \nPCR. The study identified seven inherited germline variants in the XRCC2 gene, \nwith five of these mutations being Uncertain Significance, one being Likely \nPathogenic, and one being Likely benign. RNA purity was found high with mean \nA260/280 ratios of 1.986 ± 0.097 in normal (N) and 1.963 ± 0.092 in tumor (T) \nsamples. Tumor samples exhibited a higher RNA concentration (78.56 ± 40.87 \nng/µL) than normal samples (71.44 ± 40.79 ng/µL). XRCC2 gene expression was \nsignificantly upregulated in tumor tissue, with marked increases in patients \naged 40-55 and >56 years and in higher cancer grades (II and III) and invasive \nductal carcinoma (p-values ranging from <0.0001 to 0.0392). DNA methylation \nrates in tumor tissues were low (7%), suggesting limited regulation by \nmethylation. The study suggests that XRCC2 can be classified as an oncogene and \nthat its structural investigation by targeted NGS and expression evaluation can \nbe used as a potential biomarker in BC.\n\nDOI: 10.14715/cmb/2024.70.7.36\nPMID: 39097872 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Examining methylation levels at genomic \nregions previously linked to periodontal disease may provide insights on the \nlink between periodontal disease and lung cancer.\nMETHODS: In a nested case-control study drawn from the CLUE II cohort, we \nmeasured DNA methylation levels in 208 lung cancer cases and 208 controls. We \nexamined the association between 37 DNA-methylated 5'-C-phosphate-G-3' (CpG) \nsites at three genomic regions, homeobox 4 (HOXA4), zinc finger protein (ZFP57), \nand a long noncoding RNA gene located in Chr10 (ENSG00000231601), and lung \ncancer risk.\nRESULTS: Statistically significant associations with lung cancer risk were \nobserved for all 14 CpG sites from HOXA4 (OR ranging 1.41-1.62 for 1 SD increase \nin the DNA methylation level, especially within 15 years) and 1 CpG site on gene \nENSG00000231601 (OR = 1.34 for 1 SD increase in the DNA methylation level). \nAlthough CpG sites on gene ZFP57 were not associated with lung cancer risk \noverall, statistically significant inverse associations were noted for six CpG \nsites when restricting follow-up to 15 years (OR = 0.73-0.77 for 1 SD increase \nin the DNA methylation level).\nCONCLUSIONS: Key methylation levels associated with periodontal disease are also \nassociated with lung cancer risk. For both HOXA4 and ZFP57, the associations \nwere stronger within 15 years of follow-up, which suggest that, if causal, the \nimpact of methylation is acting late in the natural history of lung cancer.\nIMPACT: Identifying biological pathways that link periodontal disease and lung \ncancer could provide new opportunities for lung cancer detection and prevention.\n\n©2024 American Association for Cancer Research.\n\nDOI: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-24-0279\nPMCID: PMC11446649\nPMID: 39093033 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: Competing interests Dr. Kelsey is a founder and \nscientific advisor for Cellintec, which had no role in this research.

Here we present PapDREAM, a new approach \nthat enables detection of rare, ovarian-cancer-specific aberrations of DNA \nmethylation from routinely-collected cervical Pap specimens. The PapDREAM \napproach employs a microfluidic platform that performs highly parallelized \ndigital high-resolution melt to analyze locus-specific DNA methylation patterns \non a molecule-by-molecule basis at or near single CpG-site resolution at a \nfraction (< 1/10th) of the cost of next-generation sequencing techniques. We \ndemonstrate the feasibility of the platform by assessing intermolecular \nheterogeneity of DNA methylation in a panel of methylation biomarker loci using \nDNA derived from Pap specimens obtained from a cohort of 43 women, including 18 \ncases with ovarian cancer and 25 cancer-free controls. PapDREAM leverages \nsystematic multidimensional bioinformatic analyses of locus-specific methylation \nheterogeneity to improve upon Pap-specimen-based detection of ovarian cancer, \ndemonstrating a clinical sensitivity of 50% at 99% specificity in detecting \novarian cancer cases with an area under the receiver operator curve of 0.90. We \nthen establish a logistic regression model that could be used to identify \nhigh-risk patients for subsequent clinical follow-up and monitoring. The results \nof this study support the utility of PapDREAM as a simple, low-cost screening \nmethod with the potential to integrate with existing clinical workflows for \nearly detection of ovarian cancer. KEY POINTS: We present a microfluidic \nplatform for detection and analysis of rare, heterogeneously methylated DNA \nwithin Pap specimens towards detection of ovarian cancer. The platform achieves \nhigh sensitivity (fractions <0.00005%) at a suitably low cost (∼$25) for routine \nscreening applications. Furthermore, it provides molecule-by-molecule \nquantitative analysis to facilitate further study on the effect of heterogeneous \nmethylation on cancer development.\n\n© 2024 The Author(s).

Differential gene correlation analysis \nunveiled a liver carcinoma-associated network marked by increased cell division \nand compromised liver-specific functions. The LASSO regression identified a \nhighly accurate HCC prediction signature, prominently featuring CpG methylation \nat cg02871891.Conclusion: Our study uncovers CpG hypermethylation at cg02871891, \npossibly influencing KDM8 downregulation in HCC, suggesting these as promising \nbiomarkers and targets.\n\nPlain Language Summary: Changes in gene function can play a role in causing \ncancer. In this study, we looked at how a specific gene called KDM8 behaves in \nliver cancer. By analyzing a large set of liver cancer samples, we investigated \nhow gene interactions are different in this disease and if they can help predict \nliver cancer risk. Our results show that the KDM8 gene is less active, and its \nDNA gets chemically modified more often in liver cancer. We also found a group \nof genes and DNA changes, which are linked to the disease. Using this \ninformation, we identified 16 important markers and built a computer model that \ncan accurately predict liver cancer. We found that DNA methylation at a specific \nspot called cg02871891 is especially important for predicting liver cancer. \nOverall, our study suggests that high levels of DNA methylation may lead to \nreduced KDM8 activity in liver cancer, which could be important for future \nresearch and better diagnostic tools.\n\nDOI: 10.1080/17501911.2024.2374702\nPMCID: PMC11370911\nPMID: 39072393 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors have no competing interests or \nrelevant affiliations with any organization or entity with the subject matter or \nmaterials discussed in the manuscript.

However, our team \npreviously reported that the CRNDE gene also encodes a micropeptide, CRNDEP. The \namino acid sequence of CRNDEP has recently been revealed by other researchers, \ntoo. This study aimed to investigate genetic alterations within the \nCRNDEP-coding region of the CRNDE gene, methylation profiling of this gene, and \nCRNDEP expression analysis. All investigations were performed on clinical \nmaterial from patients with ovarian tumors of diverse aggressiveness. We found \nthat CRNDEP levels were significantly elevated in highly aggressive tumors \ncompared to benign neoplasms. Consistently, a high level of this micropeptide \nwas a negative, independent, prognostic, and predictive factor in high-grade \novarian cancer (hgOvCa) patients. The cancer-promoting role of CRNDE(P), shown \nin our recent study, was also supported by genetic and epigenetic results \nobtained herein, revealing no CRNDEP-disrupting mutations in any clinical \nsample. Moreover, in borderline ovarian tumors (BOTS), but not in ovarian \ncancers, the presence of a single nucleotide polymorphism in CRNDE, rs115515594, \nsignificantly increased the risk of recurrence. Consistently, in BOTS only, the \nsame genetic variant was highly overrepresented compared to healthy individuals. \nWe also discovered that hypomethylation of CRNDE is associated with increased \naggressiveness of ovarian tumors. Accordingly, hypomethylation of this gene's \npromoter/first exon correlated with hgOvCa resistance to chemotherapy, but only \nin specimens with accumulation of the TP53 tumor suppressor protein. Taken \ntogether, these results contribute to a better understanding of the role of \nCRNDE(P) in tumorigenesis and potentially may lead to improvements in screening, \ndiagnosis, and treatment of ovarian neoplasms.\n\nDOI: 10.3390/ijms25147531\nPMCID: PMC11277161\nPMID: 39062774 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: Author Arkadiusz M.

Accumulating evidence suggests the regulatory role of AMP-activated \nprotein kinase (AMPK) in cancer metabolic reprogramming. In this study, \nwild-type and AMPK knockout mice were subjected to azoxymethane-induced and \ndextran sulfate sodium (AOM/DSS)-promoted colitis-associated CRC induction. A \nstable AMPK-deficient Caco-2 cell line was also established for the mechanistic \nstudies. The data showed that AMPK deficiency accelerated CRC development, \ncharacterized by increased tumor number, tumor size, and hyperplasia in \nAOM/DSS-treated mice. The aggravated colorectal tumorigenesis resulting from \nAMPK ablation was associated with reduced α-ketoglutarate production and \nten-eleven translocation hydroxylase 2 (TET2) transcription, correlated with the \nreduced mismatch repair protein mutL homolog 1 (MLH1) protein. Furthermore, in \nAMPK-deficient Caco-2 cells, the mRNA expression of mismatch repair and tumor \nsuppressor genes, intracellular α-ketoglutarate, and the protein level of TET2 \nwere also downregulated. AMPK deficiency also increased hypermethylation in the \nCpG islands of Mlh1 in both colonic tissues and Caco-2 cells. In conclusion, \nAMPK deficiency leads to reduced α-ketoglutarate concentration and elevates the \nsuppressive epigenetic modifications of tumor suppressor genes in gut epithelial \ncells, thereby increasing the risk of colorectal tumorigenesis. Given the \nmodifiable nature of AMPK activity, it holds promise as a prospective molecular \ntarget for the prevention and treatment of CRC.\n\nDOI: 10.3390/genes15070835\nPMCID: PMC11276171\nPMID: 39062614 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare no conflicts of interest."

The women that remained HPV positive at the \ntime of colposcopy were tested with the panel of DNA methylation markers. The \nperformance of the test was evaluated and compared to standard practice.\nRESULTS: The study test had a sensitivity and specificity for cervical \nintraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2+ of 60.8% (49.1-71.6%) and 88.4% (83.2-92.5%), \nrespectively.

The use of methylation reduces the referral for colposcopy \nto 25.5%, while detecting 78.0% of the CIN3+ cases. Referral of all \nHPV16/18-positive cases and triage of the other high-risk HPV-positive cases \nwith methylation, detects 90.0% of the cases of CIN3+, while reducing the number \nof referrals to 43.2%.

We aimed to evaluate thrombotic risks in patients with epigenetic \nregulator mutations and generate a model to predict thrombosis in ET.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: This cohort study enrolled patients aged > 15 years \ndiagnosed with ET at the Songklanakarind Hospital between January 2002 and \nDecember 2019. Twenty-five targeted gene mutations, including somatic driver \nmutations (JAK2, CALR, MPL), epigenetic regulator mutations (TET2, DNMT3A, IDH1, \nIDH2, TET2, ASXL1, EZH2, SF3B1, SRSF2) and other genes relevant to myeloid \nneoplasms, were identified using next-generation sequencing. Thrombotic events \nwere confirmed based on clinical condition and imaging findings, and thrombotic \nrisks were analyzed using five survival models with the recurrent event method.\nRESULTS: Ninety-six patients were enrolled with a median follow-up of 6.91 \nyears. Of these, 15 patients experienced 17 arterial thrombotic events in total. \nPatients with JAK2 mutation and IDH1 mutation had the highest frequency of \nthrombotic events with somatic driver mutations (17.3%) and epigenetic regulator \nmutations (100%). The 10-year thrombosis-free survival rate was 81.3% (95% \nconfidence interval: 72.0-91.8%). IDH1 mutation was a significant factor for \nthrombotic risk in the multivariate analysis for all models. The Prentice, \nWilliam, and Peterson (PWP) gap-time model was the most appropriate prediction \nmodel.\nCONCLUSIONS: The PWP gap-time model was a good predictive model for thrombotic \nrisk in patients with ET. IDH1 mutation was significant risk factors for \nthrombosis; however, further studies with a larger sample size should confirm \nthis and provide more insight.\n\nDOI: 10.1177/10760296241263099\nPMCID: PMC11282546\nPMID: 39053144 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: Declaration of Conflicting InterestsThe authors \ndeclared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, \nauthorship, and/or publication of this article."

DNA methylation changes are a hallmark of AML \nbut are not routinely used as a criterion for risk stratification. The aim of \nthis study was to explore DNA methylation markers that could risk stratify \npatients with cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML), currently classified as \nintermediate-risk.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: DNA methylation profiles in whole blood samples from 77 \npatients with CN-AML in The Cancer Genome Atlas (LAML cohort) were analyzed. \nIndividual 5'-cytosine-phosphate-guanine-3' (CpG) sites were assessed for their \nability to predict overall survival. The output was validated using DNA \nmethylation profiles from bone marrow samples of 79 patients with CN-AML in a \nseparate data set from the Gene Expression Omnibus.\nRESULTS: In the training set, using DNA methylation data derived from the 450K \narray, we identified 2,549 CpG sites that could potentially distinguish patients \nwith CN-AML with an adverse prognosis (intermediate-poor) from those with a more \nfavorable prognosis (intermediate-favorable) independent of age. Of these, 25 \nCpGs showed consistent prognostic potential across both the 450K and 27K array \nplatforms. In a separate validation data set, nine of these 25 CpGs exhibited \nstatistically significant differences in 2-year survival. These nine validated \nCpGs formed the basis for a combined prognostic biomarker panel, which includes \nan 8-CpG Somatic Panel and the methylation status of cg23947872. This panel \ndisplayed strong predictive ability for 2-year survival, 2-year progression-free \nsurvival, and complete remission in the validation cohort.\nCONCLUSION: This study highlights DNA methylation profiling as a promising \napproach to enhance risk stratification in patients with CN-AML, potentially \noffering a pathway to more personalized treatment strategies.\n\nDOI: 10.1200/CCI.23.00265\nPMCID: PMC11371081\nPMID: 39052947 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The following represents disclosure information \nprovided by authors of this manuscript.

Caudal type homeobox 1 \n(CDX1) gene is a homeobox transcription factor and a selective tumour suppressor \ngene that is an important factor for the development of intestinal cells. This \ngene plays a role in the differentiation of intestinal epithelial cells, and its \nexpression decreases in a number of cell lines derived from CRC, which suggests \nthat a lack of CDX1 expression is a risk factor for the development of \ncolorectal carcinoma. Therefore, the methylated DNA amounts of CDX1 gene in \nstool samples were investigated as a noninvasive method for the detection of \nCRC. In the present study, the methylation of CDX1 gene promoter region was \nassessed in stool samples of 50 CRC patients and 50 healthy individuals by \nMethyLight PCR using two primers and a Taq Man probe, which was completely \nspecifically designed for fully methylated DNA of the gene promoter region. The \npercentage of methylated reference (PMR) of the studied gene in all samples was \ncalculated similarly to previous studies. Statistical analysis was performed \nusing SPSS 16. The PMR medians were 3.25 (95% CI: 0.1-100) and 0.1 (95% CI: \n0.07-1) in the stool samples of CRC patients and healthy individuals, \nrespectively. The results showed a significant difference in CDX1 gene PMR \nbetween stool samples of CRC patients and controls (P-value\\0.001). According to \nthe results of this study, it can be argued that measurement of CDX1 gene DNA in \nstool samples using the MethyLight PCR has acceptable sensitivity and \nspecificity, and is adequately potential to be used as a noninvasive \ncomplementary method for the diagnosis of CRC, along with colonoscopy as the \ngold standard to this end. This study is the first report on CDX1 methylation in \nstool samples of CRC patients. Therefore, further research should be carried out \nwith a larger sample size to evaluate its efficacy as a diagnostic biomarker in \nclinical laboratories.\n\nPMID: 39049488 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Clinical characteristics, endometrial thickness measured by \ntransvaginal ultrasound and serum CA125 were collected. Exfoliated cervical \ncells from the thinPrep cytogic test were collected for DNA (CDO1m/CELF4m) \nmethylation testing. Endometrial tissue was collected under hysteroscopy for \npathological diagnosis as the gold standard. A univariate logistic regression \nmodel was used to analyze risk factors for endometrial cancer. The receiver \noperating characteristic (ROC) curve and area under the curve (AUC) were used to \nmeasure the diagnostic efficacy of DNA methylation detection in endometrial \ncancer screening of women with abnormal uterine bleeding.\nRESULTS: Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that age, body mass \nindex (BMI) ≥25 kg/m2, endometrial thickness ≥11 mm, CDO1 methylation \n(CDO1mΔCt≤8.4), CELF4 methylation (CELF4mΔCt≤8.8), and dual gene methylation \n(CDO1mΔCt≤8.4 or CELF4mΔCt≤8.8) were independent risk factors for endometrial \ncancer in women with abnormal uterine bleeding.

This study is the first to comprehensively \nanalyse the role of MAPK-family genes in the progression, prognosis, immune-cell \ninfiltration, methylation, and potential therapeutic value drug candidates in \nccRCC. We identified a novel prognostic panel of six MAPK-signature genes \n(MAP3K12, MAP3K1, MAP3K5, MAPK1, MAPK8, MAPK9), and introduced a robust \nMAPK-signature risk model for predicting ccRCC prognosis. Model construction, \nevaluation, and external validation using datasets from the Cancer Genome Atlas \n(TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database demonstrated its stability, as \nwell as high sensitivity and specificity. Enrichment analysis suggested the \nparticipation of immune-mediated mechanism in MAPK dysregulation in ccRCC. \nImmune-infiltration analysis confirmed the relationship and revealed that the \nMAPK-signature risk model might stratify immunotherapy response in ccRCC, which \nwas verified in drug sensitivity analysis and validated in external ccRCC \nimmunotherapy dataset (GSE67501). Potential therapeutic drug predictions for key \nMAPKs using DSigDB, Network Analyst, CTD, and DGIdb were subsequently verified \nby molecular docking with AutoDock Vina and PyMol. Mendelian randomization \nfurther demonstrated the possibilities of the MAPK-signature genes as targets \nfor therapeutic drugs in ccRCC. Methylation analysis using UALCAN and MethSurv \nrevealed the participation of epigenetic modifications in dysregulation and \nsurvival difference of MAPK pathway in ccRCC. Among the key MAPKs, MAP3K12 \nexhibited the highest significance, indicating its independent prognostic value \nas single gene in ccRCC. Knockout and overexpression validation experiments in \nvitro and in vivo found that MAP3K12 acted as a promoter of tumour progression \nin RCC, suggesting a pivotal role for MAP3K12 in the proliferation, migration, \nand invasion of RCC cells. Our findings proposed the potential of MAPK-signature \ngenes as biomarkers for prognosis and therapy response, as well as targets for \ntherapeutic drugs in ccRCC.\n\nCopyright © 2024.

Antihistamines cross the placenta and are frequently prescribed to \npregnant women to treat nausea and vomiting, as well as allergy and asthma \nsymptoms. Exposure to antihistamines in utero may impact the developing liver by \nreprogramming or inducing epigenetic changes in fetal hepatocytes.\nMETHODS: We examined in utero exposure to antihistamines and the risk of HCC in \nthe Child Health and Development Studies, a multigenerational cohort that \nenrolled pregnant women in the East Bay, CA, between 1959 and 1966 (n=14,507 \nmothers and 18,751 liveborn offspring). We reviewed mothers' medical records to \nidentify those prescribed antihistamines during pregnancy, and diagnoses of HCC \nin adult (age ≥18 y) offspring were identified by linkage with a \npopulation-based cancer registry. Cox proportional hazard models were used to \nestimate adjusted hazard ratios, with follow-up accrued from birth through \ncancer diagnosis, death, or last contact.\nRESULTS: About 15% of offspring (n=2759 of 18,751) were exposed in utero to \nantihistamines. Chlorpheniramine (51.8%) and diphenhydramine (15.4%) were the 2 \nmost commonly prescribed antihistamines. Any in utero exposure was not \nassociated with HCC (adjusted hazard ratio: 2.76, 95% CI: 0.70, 10.89), but the \nassociation differed by timing of exposure. Offspring exposed to antihistamines \nin the first or second trimester had a higher risk of HCC compared to offspring \nnot exposed (adjusted hazard ratio: 4.64, 95% CI: 1.21, 17.78). Similarly, \nincidence rates were 4.3 per 100,000 (95% CI: 0.9, 12.6) for offspring exposed \nin the first or second trimester compared to 1.0 per 100,000 (95% CI: 0.3, 2.1) \nfor offspring not exposed.\nCONCLUSIONS: In utero exposure to antihistamines in early pregnancy may increase \nthe risk of HCC in adulthood.\n\nCopyright © 2024 The Author(s).

Electronic address: Oskar.Karlsson@aces.su.se.\n\nDNA methylation plays a pivotal role in cancer. The ubiquitous contaminant \nperfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) has been epidemiologically associated with \nbreast cancer, and can induce proliferation and malignant transformation of \nnormal human breast epithelial cells (MCF-10A), but the information about its \neffect on DNA methylation is sparse. The aim of this study was to characterize \nthe whole-genome methylome effects of PFOS in our breast cell model and compare \nthe findings with previously demonstrated DNA methylation alterations in breast \ntumor tissues. The DNA methylation profile was assessed at single CpG resolution \nin MCF-10A cells treated with 1 μM PFOS for 72 h by using Enzymatic Methyl \nsequencing (EM-seq). We found 12,591 differentially methylated CpG-sites and \n13,360 differentially methylated 100 bp tiles in the PFOS exposed breast cells. \nThese differentially methylated regions (DMRs) overlapped with 2406 genes of \nwhich 494 were long non-coding RNA and 1841 protein coding genes. We identified \n339 affected genes that have been shown to display altered DNA methylation in \nbreast cancer tissue and several other genes related to cancer development. This \nincludes hypermethylation of GACAT3, DELEC1, CASC2, LCIIAR, MUC16, SYNE1 and \nhypomethylation of TTN and KMT2C. DMRs were also found in estrogen receptor \ngenes (ESR1, ESR2, ESRRG, ESRRB, GREB1) and estrogen responsive genes (GPER1, \nEEIG1, RERG). The gene ontology analysis revealed pathways related to cancer \nphenotypes such as cell adhesion and growth. These findings improve the \nunderstanding of PFOS's potential role in breast cancer and illustrate the value \nof whole-genome methylome analysis in uncovering mechanisms of chemical effects, \nidentifying biomarker candidates, and strengthening epidemiological \nassociations, potentially impacting risk assessment.\n\nCopyright © 2024 The Authors.

While genetic heterogeneity is an established \neffector of pathologic phenotypes, epigenetic heterogeneity is less well \nunderstood. Environmental exposures alter the liver-specific DNA methylation \nlandscape and influence the onset of liver cancer. Given that currently \navailable treatments are unable to target frequently mutated genes in HCC, there \nis an unmet need for novel therapeutics to prevent or reverse liver damage \nleading to hepatic tumorigenesis, which the epigenome may provide.\nAPPROACH AND RESULTS: We performed genome-wide profiling of DNA methylation, \ncopy number, and gene expression from multiple liver regions from 31 patients \nwith liver disease to examine their crosstalk and define the individual and \ncombinatorial contributions of these processes to liver disease progression. We \nidentified epigenetic heterogeneity hotspots that are conserved across patients. \nElevated epigenetic heterogeneity is associated with increased gene expression \nheterogeneity. Cirrhotic regions comprise 2 distinct cohorts-one exclusively \nepigenetic, and the other where epigenetic and copy number variations \ncollaborate. Epigenetic heterogeneity hotspots are enriched for genes central to \nliver function (eg, HNF1A ) and known tumor suppressors (eg, RASSF1A ). These \nhotspots encompass genes including ACSL1 , ACSL5 , MAT1A , and ELFN1 , which \nhave phenotypic effects in functional screens, supporting their relevance to \nhepatocarcinogenesis. Moreover, epigenetic heterogeneity hotspots are linked to \nclinical measures of outcome.\nCONCLUSIONS: Substantial epigenetic heterogeneity arises early in liver disease \ndevelopment, targeting key pathways in the progression and initiation of both \ncirrhosis and HCC. Integration of epigenetic and transcriptional heterogeneity \nunveils putative epigenetic regulators of hepatocarcinogenesis.\n\nCopyright © 2024 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.\n\nDOI: 10.1097/HEP.0000000000001023\nPMCID: PMC11742070\nPMID: 39028883 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Multinomial logistic regression models were analyzed \ncomparing mutated/nonmutated CRC cases to controls to compute \nmultivariable-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence interval (CI). \nHeterogeneity of associations of mutated compared with nonmutated CRC cases was \ntested in case-only analyses using logistic regression. Analyses were performed \nseparately in hypermutated and nonhypermutated tumors, because they exhibit \ndifferent clinical behaviors.\nRESULTS: We included 4339 CRC cases (702 hypermutated tumors, 16.2%) and 11,767 \ncontrols. Total folate intake was inversely associated with CRC risk (OR = 0.93; \n95% CI: 0.90, 0.96). Among hypermutated tumors, 12 genes (AXIN2, B2M, BCOR, \nCHD1, DOCK3, FBLN2, MAP3K21, POLD1, RYR1, TET2, UTP20, and ZNF521) showed \nnominal statistical significance (P < 0.05) for heterogeneity by mutation \nstatus, but none remained significant after multiple testing correction. Among \nthese genetic subtypes, the associations between folate variables and CRC were \nmostly inverse or toward the null, except for tumors mutated for DOCK3 \n(supplemental folic acid), CHD1 (total folate), and ZNF521 (dietary folate) that \nshowed positive associations. We did not observe differential associations in \nanalyses among nonhypermutated tumors, or according to the signaling pathways.\nCONCLUSIONS: Folate intake was not differentially associated with CRC risk \naccording to mutations in the genes explored. The nominally significant \ndifferential mutation effects observed in a few genes warrants further \ninvestigation.\n\nCopyright © 2024 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Thus far, this has \nbeen typically exploited in combination with genome editing tools (i.e., \nbase-/prime-editing, designer nucleases) to enable simultaneous genetic \nalterations and modulate complex physiologic cellular pathways. In the field of \ncancer immunotherapy, multiplex genome editing has been used to simultaneously \ninactivate three genes (i.e., TRAC, B2M, and PDCD1) and generate universal \nchimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells resistant to the inhibitory activity of \nthe PD-1 ligand. However, the intrinsic risk of genomic aberrations driven by \nsuch tools poses concerns because of the generation of multiple single-strand or \ndouble-strand DNA breaks followed by DNA repair. Modulating gene expression \nwithout DNA damage using epigenome editing promises a safer and efficient \napproach to alter gene expression. This method enables for simultaneous \nactivation and/or repression of target genes, offering superior fine-tuning \ncapabilities with reduced off-targeting effects and potential reversibility as \ncompared to genome editing. Here we describe a detailed protocol for achieving \nmultiplexed and sustainable gene silencing in CAR T cells. In an exemplary \napproach, we use designer epigenome modifiers (DEMs) for the simultaneous \ninactivation of two T cell inhibitory genes, PDCD1 and LAG3 to generate CAR T \ncells with increased resistance to tumor-induced exhaustion.\n\n© 2024.

Here, we used 10 μM BaP \nto induce malignant transformation of human bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells, \nnamed BEAS-2B-T. Results indicated that BaP (6.25, 12.5 and 25 μM) treatment \nsignificantly promoted the migration and invasion of BEAS-2B-T cells. Meanwhile, \nBaP exposure inhibited ferroptosis in BEAS-2B-T, ferroptosis-related indexes \nFe2+, malondialdehyde (MDA), lipid peroxidation (LPO) and reactive oxygen \nspecies (ROS) decreased significantly. The protein level of ferroptosis-related \nmolecule transferrin receptor (TFRC) decreased significantly, while solute \ncarrier family 7 membrane 11 (SLC7A11), ferritin heavy chain 1 (FTH1) and \nglutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) increased significantly. The intervention of \nferroptosis dramatically effected the migration and invasion of BEAS-2B-T \ninduced by BaP. Furthermore, the expression of YTH N6-methyladenosine RNA \nbinding protein 1 (YTHDF1) was markedly increased after BaP exposure. YTHDF1 \nknockdown inhibited BEAS-2B-T migration and invasion by promoting ferroptosis. \nIn the meantime, the contents of Fe2+, MDA, LPO and ROS increased significantly, \nTFRC was markedly increased, and SLC7A11, FTH1, and GPX4 were markedly \ndecreased. Moreover, overexpression of YTHDF1 promoted BEAS-2B-T migration and \ninvasion by inhibiting ferroptosis. Importantly, knockdown of YTHDF1 promoted \nferroptosis and reduced BEAS-2B-T migration and invasion during BaP exposure, \nand overexpression of YTHDF1 increased migration and invasion of BEAS-2B-T by \ninhibiting ferroptosis during BaP exposure. RNA immunoprecipitation assays \nindicated that the binding of YTHDF1 to SLC7A11 and FTH1 markedly increased \nafter YTHDF1 overexpression. Therefore, we concluded that BaP promotes the \nmalignant progression of BEAS-2B-T cells through YTHDF1 upregulating SLC7A11 and \nFTH1 to inhibit ferroptosis. This study reveals new epigenetic and ferroptosis \nmarkers for preventing and treating lung cancer induced by environmental \ncarcinogens.\n\nCopyright © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

Inhibitors of DNA binding proteins (ID) are a class of \nhelix-loop-helix transcription regulatory factors; these proteins are considered \na family of four highly preserved transcriptional regulators (ID1-4), shown to \nplay significant roles in many processes that are associated with tumor \ndevelopment. ID family plays as negatively dominant antagonists of other \nessential HLH proteins, concluding the creation of non-functional heterodimers \nand regulation of the transcription process.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: 120 Fresh tissue and blood samples Forty (40) samples of \nfresh tissue and blood were collected from patients diagnosed with CRC, twenty \n(20) samples were collected from a patient diagnosed as healthy. The (qRT-PCR) \nmethod is a sensitive technique for the quantifying of steady-state mRNA levels \nthat used to evaluation the expression levels of ID (1-4) gene.\nRESULTS: The findings indicate downregulation in ID1 in tissue with a highly \nsignificant change between patients and control groups, where upregulation in \nthe ID1 gene is shown in blood samples.ID2 gene also demonstrated high \nsignificant change where show upregulation in tissue and downregulation in blood \nsample. ID3 and ID4 genes show downregulation in tissue and blood samples with a \nsignificant change in ID3 blood samples between patient and blood groups.\nCONCLUSION: Because of the regulation function of the ID family in many \nprocesses, the up or down regulation of IDs genes in tumors Proves how important \nits tumor development, and therefore those proteins can be used as an indicator \nfor CRC.\n\n© 2024.

Imaging \napproaches do not provide sufficient detail to discriminate between different \ntumor types, while the histopathological examination of tumor tissue shows high \ninter-observer variability. Recent studies have demonstrated the accurate \nclassification of central nervous system tumors based on the DNA methylation \nprofile of a tumor biopsy. However, a brain biopsy holds significant risk of \nbleeding and damaging the surrounding tissues. Liquid biopsy approaches \nanalyzing circulating tumor DNA show high potential as an alternative and less \ninvasive tool to study the DNA methylation pattern of tumors. Here, we explore \nthe potential of classifying pediatric brain tumors based on methylation \nprofiling of the circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). \nFor this proof-of-concept study, we collected cerebrospinal fluid samples from \n19 pediatric brain cancer patients via a ventricular drain placed for reasons of \nincreased intracranial pressure. Analyses on the cfDNA showed high variability \nof cfDNA quantities across patients ranging from levels below the limit of \nquantification to 40 ng cfDNA per milliliter of CSF. Classification based on \nmethylation profiling of cfDNA from CSF was correct for 7 out of 20 samples in \nour cohort. Accurate results were mostly observed in samples of high quality, \nmore specifically those with limited high molecular weight DNA contamination. \nInterestingly, we show that centrifugation of the CSF prior to processing \nincreases the fraction of fragmented cfDNA to high molecular weight DNA. In \naddition, classification was mostly correct for samples with high tumoral cfDNA \nfraction as estimated by computational deconvolution (> 40%). In summary, \nanalysis of cfDNA in the CSF shows potential as a tool for diagnosing pediatric \nnervous system tumors especially in patients with high levels of tumoral cfDNA \nin the CSF. Further optimization of the collection procedure, experimental \nworkflow and bioinformatic approach is required to also allow classification for \npatients with low tumoral fractions in the CSF.\n\n© 2024.

The existing knowledge regarding the association of PIWI-interacting \nRNAs (piRNAs) and their genetic variants on risk and progression of prostate \ncancer (PCa) is limited. In this study, three genome-wide association study \ndatasets are combined, including 85,707 PCa cases and 166,247 controls, to \nuncover genetic variants in piRNAs. Functional investigations involved \nmanipulating piRNA expression in cellular and mouse models to study its \noncogenetic role in PCa. A specific genetic variant, rs17201241 is identified, \nassociated with increased expression of PROPER (piRNA overexpressed in prostate \ncancer) in tumors and are located within the gene, conferring an increased risk \nand malignant progression of PCa. Mechanistically, PROPER coupled with YTHDF2 to \nrecognize N6-methyladenosine (m6A) and facilitated RNA-binding protein \ninteractions between EIF2S3 at 5'-untranslated region (UTR) and YTHDF2/YBX3 at \n3'-UTR to promote DUSP1 circularization. This m6A-dependent mRNA-looping pattern \nenhanced DUSP1 degradation and inhibited DUSP1 translation, ultimately reducing \nDUSP1 expression and promoting PCa metastasis via the p38 mitogen-activated \nprotein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. Inhibition of PROPER expression using \nantagoPROPER effectively suppressed xenograft growth, suggesting its potential \nas a therapeutic target. Thus, targeting piRNA PROPER-mediated genetic and \nepigenetic fine control is a promising strategy for the concurrent prevention \nand treatment of PCa.\n\n© 2024 The Author(s).

However, diagnostic performance of \nmethylation data at individual CpG-sites is limited. We explored methylation for \npredicting HSIL+ in self- and clinician-collected samples from Papua New Guinea. \nMethylation of EPB41L3 (1-6 CpG-sites), hTERT (1-10 CpG-sites) and FAM19A4 (1-5 \nCpG-sites) was assessed through pyrosequencing from 44 HPV+ samples (4 cancers, \n19 HSIL, 4 low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL), 17 normal). New \nprimers were designed for FAM19A4 directed to the first exon region not explored \npreviously. In clinician-collected samples, methylation at CpG-sites 4 and 5 of \nEPB41L3 were the best HSIL predictors (AUC >0.83) and CpG-site 4 for cancer \n(0.925). Combination of EPB41L3 sites 2/4 plus FAM19A4 site 1 were the best \nHSIL+ markers [100% sensitivity, 63.2% specificity]. Methylation at CpG-site 5 \nof FAM19A4 was the best HSIL predictor (0.67) in self-collected samples, and \nCpG-sites 1 and 3 of FAM19A4 for cancer (0.77). Combined, FAM19A4 site 1 plus \nHPV 16/18 detection yielded sensitivity of 82.6% and specificity of 61.9%. In \nconclusion, methylation at individual CpG-sites of EPB41L3 and FAM19A4 \noutperformed global analysis and improved HSIL+ detection, warranting further \ninvestigation.\n\nCopyright © 2024 The Authors.

Among these groups, \nAfrican American (AA) women have the highest incidence of BCa and the lowest \nlevels of Vitamin D (VD). Numerous studies have explored the connection between \nvariations in the VDR gene and BCa risk, particularly in different populations, \nbut research on the AA population remains limited. Epigenetic modifications, \nincluding specific microRNAs (miRNAs), can influence gene expression without \naltering the genetic code and have been implicated in cancer initiation and \nprogression. Our hypothesis suggests that VDR gene variations may increase BCa \nrisk in AA women and that changes in miRNA expression profiles could contribute \nto BCa development. Using data from the 1000 Genome Project, we identified five \nVDR gene variants with significant frequency differences between AA and \nEuropean-American (EA) populations. We genotyped 404 African American BCa cases \nand controls for five variants using TaqMan® assays. SNPstats assessed their \nassociation with BCa risk. The rs1544410 variant's recessive model (A/A) showed \na decreased BCa risk in AA (odds ratio 0.33, 95% CI: 0.15-0.73, p-value 0.0041). \nConversely, the rs2853563 variant's recessive model (A/A) was linked to an \nincreased BCa risk (odds ratio 4.04, 95% CI: 1.49-10.95, p-value 0.0022). We \ninvestigated miRNA expression influenced by VD in HCC1806 Triple-Negative Breast \nCancer (TNBC) cell lines with the A/A allele for rs2853563. nCounter® Nanostring \ntechnology assessed miRNA profiles after calcitriol treatment. Our results \nindicated that calcitriol treatment led to reduced expression of six miRNAs, \nfour of which are associated with tumor suppression in the presence of the AA \ngenotype in TNBC cell lines. These findings suggest that specific VDR genotypes \ncould have a potential effect on the miRNAs expression which could potentially \nserve as markers for cell proliferation in TNBC.\n\nCopyright © 2024.

Indeed, the cell's response to external stimuli is often \nmediated epigenetically. In this commentary, we highlight work on the critical \nrole that epigenetic machinery, such as DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), Enhancer \nof Zeste Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 Subunit (EZH2), and others play in \nregulating gene expression and cellular functions in three urological contexts.\nDESIGN: Animal and cellular constructs were used to model clinical pediatric \nuropathology. The hypertrophy, trabeculation, and fibrosis of the chronically \nobstructed bladder was explored using smooth muscle cell models employing \ndisorganised vs. normal extracellular matrix (ECM), as well as a new animal \nmodel of chronic obstructive bladder disease (COBD) which retains its pathologic \nfeatures even after bladder de-obstruction. Cell models from human and murine \nhypospadias or genital tubercles (GT) were used to illustrate developmental \nresponses and epigenetic dependency of key developmental genes. Finally, using \nbladder urothelial and organoid culture systems, we examined activity of \nepigenetic machinery in response to non uropathogenic vs. uropathogenic E.coli \n(UPEC). DNMT and EZH2 expression and function were interrogated in these model \nsystems.\nRESULTS: Disordered ECM exerted a principal mitogenic and epigenetic role for on \nbladder smooth muscle both in vitro and in CODB in vivo. Key genes, e.g., BDNF \nand KCNB2 were under epigenetic regulation in actively evolving obstruction and \nCOBD, though each condition showed distinct epigenetic responses. In models of \nhypospadias, estrogen strongly dysregulated WNT and Hox expression, which was \nnormalized by epigenetic inhibition. Finally, DNA methylation machinery in the \nurothelium showed specific activation when challenged by uropathogenic E.coli. \nSimilarly, UPEC induces hypermethylation and downregulation of the growth \nsuppressor p16INK4A. Moreover, host cells exposed to UPEC produced secreted \nfactors inducing epigenetic responses transmissible from one affected cell to \nanother without ongoing bacterial presence.\nDISCUSSION: Microenvironmental influences altered epigenetic activity in the \nthree described urologic contexts. Considering that many obstructed bladders \ncontinue to display abnormal architecture and dysfunction despite relief of \nobstruction similar to after resection of posterior valves or BPH, the \nepigenetic mechanisms described highlight novel approaches for understanding the \nunderlying smooth muscle myopathy of this crucial clinical problem. Similarly, \nthere is evidence for an epigenetic basis of xenoestrogen on development of \nhypospadias, and UTI-induced pan-urothelial alteration of epigenetic marks and \npropensity for subsequent (recurrent) UTI. The impact of mechanical, hormonal, \ninfectious triggers on genitourinary epigenetic machinery activity invite novel \navenues for targeting epigenetic modifications associated with these non-cancer \ndiseases in urology. This includes the use of deactivated CRISPR-based \ntechnologies for precise epigenome targeting and editing. Overall, we underscore \nthe importance of understanding epigenetic regulation in pediatric urology for \nthe development of innovative therapeutic and management strategies.\n\nCopyright © 2024.

DNA from tumors \nand matched peripheral blood underwent WES using Illumina HiSeq3000.\nRESULTS: A total of 192 nonsynonymous variants were identified. The median \nnumber of protein-altering mutations was 9. The most frequently mutated genes \nincluded BCOR, CLMN, EZH1, JAM2, KRTAP13-3, MUC16, MUC19, and OR1S1. Seventeen \nmutated genes belong to the Cancer Gene Census list. The most consistent hub \ngenes identified through STRING network analysis were ATM, COL4A5, EZH2, MED12, \nMEN1, MTOR, PI3, PIK3CA, PIK3CB, and UBR5. Deregulated pathways included the PI3 \nK/AKT/mTOR pathway, Wnt signaling, and extracellular matrix organization. \nVariants in genes such as MEN1, CDC73, EZH2, PIK3CA, and MTOR, previously \nreported as established or putative/candidate driver genes in benign adenoma \n(PA) and/or PC, were also identified in APT.\nCONCLUSION: APT does not appear to have a specific molecular signature but \nshares genomic alterations with both PA and PC. The incidence of CDC73 mutations \nis low, and it remains unclear whether these mutations are associated with a \nhigher risk of recurrence. Our study confirms that PI3 K/AKT/mTOR and Wnt \nsignaling represents the pivotal pathways in parathyroid tumorigenesis and also \nrevealed mutations in key epigenetic modifier genes (BCOR, KDM2A, MBD4, and \nEZH2) involved in chromatin remodeling, DNA, and histone methylation.\n\n© The Author(s) 2024.

However, \nthe role of inherited cancer predisposition alleles in co-opting lineage factor \nepigenetic reprogramming and tumor progression remains elusive. Here the FinnGen \ncohort phenome-wide analysis, along with multiple genome-wide association \nstudies, has consistently identified the rs339331-RFX6/6q22 locus associated \nwith prostate cancer (PCa) risk across diverse populations. It is uncovered that \nrs339331 resides in a reprogrammed androgen receptor (AR) binding site in PCa \ntumors, with the T risk allele enhancing AR chromatin occupancy. RFX6, an \nAR-regulated gene linked to rs339331, exhibits synergistic prognostic value for \nPCa recurrence and metastasis. This comprehensive in vitro and in vivo studies \ndemonstrate the oncogenic functions of RFX6 in promoting PCa cell proliferation \nand metastasis. Mechanistically, RFX6 upregulates HOXA10 that profoundly \ncorrelates with adverse PCa outcomes and is pivotal in RFX6-mediated PCa \nprogression, facilitating the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and \nmodulating the TGFβ/SMAD signaling axis. Clinically, HOXA10 elevation is \nassociated with increased EMT scores, tumor advancement and PCa recurrence. \nRemarkably, reducing RFX6 expression restores enzalutamide sensitivity in \nresistant PCa cells and tumors. This findings reveal a complex interplay of \ngenetic and epigenetic mechanisms in PCa pathogenesis and drug resistance, \ncentered around disrupted prostate lineage AR signaling and abnormal RFX6 \nexpression.\n\n© 2024 The Author(s).

In other words, aging is irreversible but aging-related diseases are \nreversible, so taking measures to treat them is important for health longevity \nand preventing other diseases. Therefore, in this study, we used BioBran \ncontaining rice kefiran as an approach to improve aging. Rice kefiran has been \nreported to improve the intestinal microflora, regulate the intestines, and have \nanti-aging effects. BioBran has also been reported to have antioxidant effects \nand improve liver function, and human studies have shown that it affects the \ndiversity of the intestinal microbiota. Quantitative measures of aging that \ncorrelate with disease risk are now available through the epigenetic clock test, \nwhich examines the entire gene sequence and determines biological age based on \nthe methylation level.

Electronic address: mcg.bleeker@amsterdamumc.nl.\n\nVulvar lichen sclerosus (LS) is an inflammatory dermatosis that can progress to \nhuman papillomavirus (HPV)-independent vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (HPVi \nVIN) and vulvar squamous cell carcinoma (VSCC). Although LS has a much lower \ncancer risk compared with HPVi VIN (5% vs 50%, respectively), its incidence is \nsignificantly higher. Therefore, there is a clinical need to identify LS \npatients with an increased cancer risk. Our objective was to study the value of \nDNA methylation and p53 immunohistochemistry (IHC) as prognostic biomarkers for \nprogression to cancer in patients with LS. Vulvar tissues from 236 patients were \nselected, including 75 LS and 68 HPVi VIN, both with and without cancer \ndevelopment, 32 VSCC, and 61 healthy vulvar controls. Samples were subjected to \np53 IHC and DNA methylation analysis of a 3-gene marker panel containing ZNF582, \nSST, and miR124-2. Methylation levels and p53 IHC status (mutant or wild-type) \nwere assessed and compared among all disease categories. Odds ratios were \ndetermined to identify whether the biomarkers were associated with progression \nto cancer in patients with LS. The highest methylation levels were found in HPVi \nVIN and VSCC, followed by LS and healthy vulvar controls. The largest \nheterogeneity in methylation levels was observed in LS cases. In fact, the \n3-marker panel tested positive in 70% of LS, which progressed to VSCC vs only \n17% of LS in patients without cancer development (P = .002). Also, mutant p53 \nIHC was observed more frequently in LS with progression to VSCC compared with \nnonprogressive LS cases (42% vs 3%, respectively, P = .001). Multivariable \nanalysis identified a mutant p53 status as the only independent risk factor for \ncancer development in LS (odds ratio: 34.0, 95% CI: 1.4-807.4). In conclusion, \nDNA methylation testing and p53 IHC show strong potential as prognostic \nbiomarkers for the identification of LS patients at high risk of progression to \ncancer.\n\nCopyright © 2024 The Authors.

showing DNA methylation patterns that are \nthe same in all human tissues, are different among individuals, and are \npartially regulated by genetic variants in cis. In this study we aimed at \ninvestigating single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within CoRSIVs and their \ninvolvement with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) risk. We analyzed \n29,099 CoRSIV-SNPs and 133,615 CoRSIV-mQTLs in 14,394 cases and 247,022 controls \nof European and Asian descent. We observed that the A allele of the rs2976395 \nSNP was associated with increased PDAC risk in Europeans (p = 2.81 × 10-5). This \nSNP lies in the prostate stem cell antigen gene and is in perfect linkage \ndisequilibrium with a variant (rs2294008) that has been reported to be \nassociated with risk of many other cancer types. The A allele is associated with \nthe DNA methylation level of the gene according to the PanCan-meQTL database and \nwith overexpression according to QTLbase. The expression of the gene has been \nobserved to be deregulated in many tumors of the gastrointestinal tract \nincluding pancreatic cancer; however, functional studies are needed to elucidate \nthe function relevance of the association.\n\n© 2024 UICC.\n\nDOI: 10.1002/ijc.35046\nPMID: 38924078 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

It comprises \nextensive genetic, sociodemographic and clinical data from volunteers in \nScotland.\nPARTICIPANTS: A total of 24 084 adult participants, including 5501 families, \nwere recruited between 2006 and 2011. Within the cohort, 59% (approximately 14 \n209) are women, with an average age at recruitment of 49 years. Participants \ncompleted a health questionnaire and attended an in-person clinic visit, where \ndetailed baseline data were collected on lifestyle information, cognitive \nfunction, personality traits and mental and physical health. Genotype array data \nare available for 20 026 (83%) participants, and blood-based DNA methylation \n(DNAm) data for 18 869 (78%) participants. Linkage to routine National Health \nService datasets has been possible for 93% (n=22 402) of the cohort, creating a \nlongitudinal resource that includes primary care, hospital attendance, \nprescription and mortality records. Multimodal brain imaging is available in \n1069 individuals.\nFINDINGS TO DATE: GS has been widely used by researchers across the world to \nstudy the genetic and environmental basis of common complex diseases.

Besides its traditional function in telomere synthesis, TERT \nacts as a transcriptional co-regulator of genes pivotal in aging and \nage-associated diseases. Here, we report the identification of a TERT activator \ncompound (TAC) that upregulates TERT transcription via the MEK/ERK/AP-1 cascade. \nIn primary human cells and naturally aged mice, TAC-induced elevation of TERT \nlevels promotes telomere synthesis, blunts tissue aging hallmarks with reduced \ncellular senescence and inflammatory cytokines, and silences p16INK4a expression \nvia upregulation of DNMT3B-mediated promoter hypermethylation. In the brain, TAC \nalleviates neuroinflammation, increases neurotrophic factors, stimulates adult \nneurogenesis, and preserves cognitive function without evident toxicity, \nincluding cancer risk. Together, these findings underscore TERT's critical role \nin aging processes and provide preclinical proof of concept for physiological \nTERT activation as a strategy to mitigate multiple aging hallmarks and \nassociated pathologies.\n\nCopyright © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

However, the interplay between epigenetic regulation \nand genetic changes in carcinogenesis has yet to receive comprehensive \nattention. This study investigates the impact of continuous exposure to the \ntobacco-specific carcinogen 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) \non bronchial epithelial cells, leading to malignant transformation. Our findings \nreveal the down-regulation of the tumor suppressor-like circular RNA circNIPBL \nduring oncogenic processes concomitant with the accumulation of the TP53-H179R, \na single nucleotide variant. Diminished circNIPBL expression enhances the \nproliferative, distant metastatic, and tumor-forming capabilities of NNK-induced \ncancerous cells and lung cancer cell lines (A549, H1299), while also promoting \nthe accumulation of TP53-H179R during NNK-induced carcinogenesis. Mechanistic \ninvestigations demonstrate that circNIPBL interacts with HSP90α to regulate the \ntranslocation of AHR into the nucleus, which may be a potential regulatory \nmechanism for NNK-induced carcinogenesis and TP53-H179R accumulation. This study \nintroduces a novel perspective on the interplay between genetic alterations and \nepigenetic regulation in chemical carcinogenesis, which provides novel insight \ninto the etiology of cancer.\n\nCopyright © 2024 The Authors.

Previous \ngermline genetic studies examining the one carbon (folate) metabolism pathway \nwere limited in sample size, scope, and population diversity and led to \ninconclusive results.\nMETHODS: We evaluated whether ∼2,900 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) \nwithin 46 candidate genes involved in the folate metabolism pathway influence \nthe risk of childhood ALL, using genome-wide data from nine case-control studies \nin the Childhood Cancer and Leukemia International Consortium (n = 9,058 cases \nincluding 4,510 children of European ancestry, 3,018 Latinx, and 1,406 Asians, \nand 92,364 controls). Each study followed a standardized protocol for quality \ncontrol and imputation of genome-wide data and summary statistics were \nmeta-analyzed for all children combined and by major ancestry group using METAL \nsoftware.\nRESULTS: None of the selected SNPs reached statistical significance, overall and \nfor major ancestry groups (using adjusted Bonferroni P-value of 5 × 10-6 and \nless-stringent P-value of 3.5 × 10-5 accounting for the number of \"independent\" \nSNPs). None of the 10 top (nonsignificant) SNPs and corresponding genes \noverlapped across ancestry groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: This large meta-analysis of original data does not reveal \nassociations between many common genetic variants in the folate metabolism \npathway and childhood ALL in various ancestry groups.\nIMPACT: Genetic variants in the folate pathway alone do not appear to \nsubstantially influence childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia risk.

FGL1 and FGL2 are two members of the fibrinogen-related \nproteins family, but their potential effects on BLCA remain elusive. Methods: \nThe expression profile of FGL1 and FGL2 in BLCA was analyzed in multiple \ndatabases. Furthermore, the expression of FGL2 was validated in BLCA tissues. \nThe predictive capability of FGL2 was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier analysis, \nunivariate analysis, and multivariate Cox regression.

Results: FGL2 was found to be downregulated \nin BLCA due to hypermethylation of the FGL2 promoter region, which was \nassociated with an unfavorable prognosis. Moreover, BLCA patients with high FGL2 \nexpression exhibited better response to immunotherapy. Conclusions: Our research \nrevealed that FGL2 was downregulated in BLCA and was negatively correlated with \nDNA methylation.

DNA methylation alterations play critical roles in lung \ncarcinogenesis and may serve as valuable biomarkers for precision medicine \nstrategies. We employed the Infinium MethylationEPIC array to identify autosomal \nsex-related differentially methylated CpG sites (DM-CpGs) in lung epithelium of \nhealthy individuals (32 females and 37 males) while controlling for age, BMI, \nand tobacco use. We correlated DM-CpGs with gene expression in lung epithelium \nand immune responses in bronchoalveolar lavage. We validated these DM-CpGs in \nlung tumors and adjacent normal tissue from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). \nAmong 522 identified DM-CpGs, 61% were hypermethylated in females, predominantly \nlocated in promoter regions. These DM genes were implicated in cell-to-cell \nsignaling, cellular function, transport, and lipid metabolism. Correlation \nanalysis revealed sex-specific patterns between DM-CpGs and gene expression. \nAdditionally, several DM-CpGs were correlated significantly with cytokines \n(IL-1β, IL-4, IL-12p70, and IFN-γ), macrophage, and lymphocyte counts. Also, \nsome DM-CpGs were observed in TCGA lung adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, \nand adjacent normal tissues. Our findings highlight sex-specific DNA methylation \npatterns in healthy lung epithelium and their associations with lung gene \nexpression and lung immune biomarkers. These findings underscore the potential \nrole of lung sex-related CpGs as epigenetic predispositions influencing sex \ndisparities in lung cancer risk and outcomes, warranting further investigation \nfor personalized lung cancer management strategies.\n\n© 2024.

DNA methylation \nis a frequent event in bladder cancer, participating in tumor initiation and \nprogression. Bladder cancer is a major health issue in patients suffering from \nneurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD), although the pathogenetic \nmechanisms of the disease remain unclear. In this population, bladder cancer is \ncharacterized by aggressive histopathology, advanced stage during diagnosis, and \nhigh mortality rates. To assess the DNA methylation profiles of five genes' \npromoters previously known to be associated with bladder cancer in bladder \ntissue of NLUTD patients, we conducted a prospective study recruiting NLUTD \npatients from the neuro-urology unit of a public teaching hospital. Cystoscopy \ncombined with biopsy for bladder cancer screening was performed in all patients \nfollowing written informed consent being obtained. Quantitative \nmethylation-specific PCR was used to determine the methylation status of RASSF1, \nRARβ, DAPK, hTERT, and APC genes' promoters in bladder tissue samples. \nTwenty-four patients suffering from mixed NLUTD etiology for a median duration \nof 10 (IQR: 12) years were recruited in this study. DNA hypermethylation was \ndetected in at least one gene of the panel in all tissue samples. RAR-β was \nhypermethylated in 91.7% samples, RASSF and DAPK were hypermethylated in 83.3% \nsamples, APC 37.5% samples, and TERT in none of the tissue samples. In 45.8% of \nthe samples, three genes of the panel were hypermethylated, in 29.2% four genes \nwere hypermethylated, and in 16.7% and in 8.3% of the samples, two and one gene \nwere hypermethylated, respectively. The number of hypermethylated genes of the \npanel was significantly associated with recurrent UTIs (p = 0.0048). No other \nsignificant association was found between DNA hypermethylation or the number of \nhypermethylated genes and the clinical characteristics of the patients. \nHistopathological findings were normal in 8.3% of patients, while chronic \ninflammation was found in 83.3% of patients and squamous cell metaplasia in \n16.7% of patients. In this study, we observed high rates of DNA hypermethylation \nof genes associated with bladder cancer in NLUTD patients, suggesting an \nepigenetic field effect and possible risk of bladder cancer development. \nRecurrent UTIs seem to be associated with increased DNA hypermethylation. \nFurther research is needed to evaluate the impact of recurrent UTIs and chronic \ninflammation in DNA hypermethylation and bladder cancer etiopathogenesis in \nNLUTD patients.\n\nDOI: 10.3390/ijms25115660\nPMCID: PMC11171624\nPMID: 38891848 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare no conflict of interest."

Pimonidazole (PIMO) is an investigational hypoxia \nprobe used in clinical trials. A better understanding of the clinical \nsignificance and molecular alterations underpinning PIMO-labeled tumor hypoxia \nis needed for future clinical application. Here, we investigated the clinical \nsignificance and molecular alterations underpinning PIMO-labeled tumor hypoxia \nin patients with localized PCa, in order to apply PIMO as a prognostic tool and \nto identify potential biomarkers for future clinical translation.\nMETHODS: A total of 39 patients with localized PCa were recruited and \nadministered oral PIMO before undergoing radical prostatectomy (RadP). \nImmunohistochemical staining for PIMO was performed on 37 prostatectomy \nspecimens with staining patterns evaluated and clinical association analyzed. \nWhole genome bisulfite sequencing was performed using laser-capture of \nmicrodissected specimen sections comparing PIMO positive and negative tumor \nareas. A hypoxia related methylation molecular signature was generated by \nintegrating the differentially methylated regions with previously established \nRNA-seq datasets.\nRESULTS: Three PIMO staining patterns were distinguished: diffuse, focal, and \ncomedo-like. The comedo-like staining pattern was more commonly associated with \nadverse pathology. PIMO-defined hypoxia intensity was positively correlated with \nadvanced pathologic stage, tumor invasion, and cribriform and intraductal \ncarcinoma morphology. The generated DNA methylation signature was found to be a \nrobust hypoxia biomarker, which could risk-stratify PCa patients across multiple \nclinical datasets, as well as be applicable in other cancer types.\nCONCLUSIONS: Oral PIMO unveiled clinicopathologic features of disease \naggressiveness in localized PCa. The generated DNA methylation signature is a \nnovel and robust hypoxia biomarker that has the potential for future clinical \ntranslation.\n\n© 2024.

Therefore, this study aimed to comprehensively explore \nthe function and prognostic value of HMs-based signature in KIRC. HMs were first \nobtained from top journal. Then, the mRNA expression profiles and clinical \ninformation in KIRC samples were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) \ndatabase and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets. Cox regression analysis and \nleast absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) analysis were \nimplemented to find prognosis-related HMs and construct a risk model related to \nthe prognosis in KIRC. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to determine prognostic \ndifferences between high- and low-risk groups. Immune infiltration and drug \nsensitivity analysis were also performed between high- and low-risk groups. \nEventually, 8 HMs were successfully identified for the construction of a risk \nmodel in KIRC. The results of the correlation analysis between risk signature \nand the prognosis showed HMs-based signature has good prognostic value in KIRC. \nResults of immune analysis of risk models showed there were significant \ndifferences in the level of immune cell infiltration and expression of immune \ncheckpoints between high- and low-risk groups. The results of the drug \nsensitivity analysis showed that the high-risk group was more sensitive to \nseveral chemotherapeutic agents such as Sunitinib, Tipifarnib, Nilotinib and \nBosutinib than the low-risk group. In conclusion, we successfully constructed \nHMs-based prognostic signature that can predict the prognosis of KIRC.\n\nDOI: 10.18632/aging.205944\nPMCID: PMC11236308\nPMID: 38888515 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: CONFLICTS OF INTEREST: The authors declare no \nconflicts of interest related to this study."

N6-methyladenosine (m6A) plays pivotal \nroles in mRNA metabolism and hnRNPA2B1 as an m6A reader is shown to exert \nm6A-dependent mRNA stabilization in cancer. This study aims to explore the role \nof hnRNPA2B1 in H. pylori-associated GC and its novel molecular mechanism. \nMultiple datasets and tissue microarray are utilized for assessing hnRNPA2B1 \nexpression in response to H. pylori infection and its clinical prognosis in \npatients with GC. The roles of hnRNPA2B1 are investigated through a variety of \ntechniques including glucose metabolism analysis, m6A-epitranscriptomic \nmicroarray, Ribo-seq, polysome profiling, RIP-seq. In addition, hnRNPA2B1 \ninteraction with poly(A) binding protein cytoplasmic 1 (PABPC1) is validated \nusing mass spectrometry and co-IP. These results show that hnRNPA2B1 is \nupregulated in GC and correlated with poor prognosis. H. pylori infection \ninduces hnRNPA2B1 upregulation through recruiting NF-κB to its promoter. \nIntriguingly, cytoplasm-anchored hnRNPA2B1 coordinated PABPC1 to stabilize its \nrelationship with cap-binding eIF4F complex, which facilitated the translation \nof CIP2A, DLAT and GPX1 independent of m6A modification. In summary, hnRNPA2B1 \nfacilitates the non-m6A translation of epigenetic mRNAs in GC progression by \ninteracting with PABPC1-eIF4F complex and predicts poor prognosis for patients \nwith GC.\n\n© 2024 The Author(s).

In this study, we found that chronic Cd (3 μM) exposure \npromoted the proliferation, adhesion, migration, and invasion of CRC cells in \nvitro, as well as lung metastasis in vivo. RNA-seq and TCGA-COAD datasets \nrevealed that decreased hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase trifunctional multienzyme \ncomplex subunit beta (HADHB) expression may be a crucial factor in Cd-induced \nCRC progression. Further analysis using qRT-PCR and tissue microarrays from CRC \npatients showed that HADHB expression was significantly reduced in CRC tissues \ncompared to adjacent normal tissues, and low HADHB expression was associated \nwith adverse clinical features and poor overall survival, either directly or \nthrough TNM stage. Furthermore, HADHB was found to play an important role in the \nCd-induced malignant metastatic phenotype of CRC cells and lung metastasis in \nmice. Mechanistically, we discovered that chronic Cd exposure resulted in \nhypermethylation of the HADHB promoter region via inhibition of DNA demethylase \ntet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 (TET2), which then led to decreased HADHB \nexpression and activation of the FAK signaling pathway, and ultimately \ncontributed to CRC progression. In conclusion, this study provided a new \npotential insight and evaluable biomarker for Cd exposure-induced CRC \nprogression and treatment.\n\nCopyright © 2024.

Two psoriasis-related datasets (GSE13355 \nand GSE14905) were merged into one comprehensive dataset after removing batch \neffects. Differentially expressed genes were identified using Limma and \nco-expression network analysis (WGCNA), and machine learning random forest \nalgorithm (RF) was used to screen the hub genes. We analyzed relevant gene \nenrichment pathways using GO and KEGG, and immune cell infiltration in psoriasis \nand CESC samples using CIBERSORT. The miRNA-mRNA and TFs-mRNA regulatory \nnetworks were then constructed using Cytoscape, and the biomarkers for psoriasis \nand CESC were determined. Potential drug targets were obtained from the cMAP \ndatabase, and biomarker expression levels in hela and psoriatic cell models were \nquantified by RT-qPCR.\nRESULTS: In this study, we identified 27 key genes associated with psoriasis and \ncervical squamous cell carcinoma. NCAPH, UHRF1, CDCA2, CENPN and MELK were \nidentified as hub genes using the Random Forest machine learning algorithm. \nChromosome mitotic region segregation, nucleotide binding and DNA methylation \nare the major enrichment pathways for common DEGs in the mitotic cell cycle. \nThen we analyzed immune cell infiltration in psoriasis and cervical squamous \ncell carcinoma samples using CIBERSORT. Meanwhile, we used the cMAP database to \nidentify ten small molecule compounds that interact with the central gene as \ndrug candidates for treatment. By analyzing miRNA-mRNA and TFs-mRNA regulatory \nnetworks, we identified three miRNAs and nine transcription factors closely \nassociated with five key genes and validated their expression in external \nvalidation datasets and clinical samples. Finally, we examined the diagnostic \neffects with ROC curves, and performed experimental validation in hela and \npsoriatic cell models.\nCONCLUSIONS: We identified five biomarkers, NCAPH, UHRF1, CDCA2, CENPN, and \nMELK, which may play important roles in the common pathogenesis of psoriasis and \ncervical squamous cell carcinoma, furthermore predict potential therapeutic \nagents. These findings open up new perspectives for the diagnosis and treatment \nof psoriasis and squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix.\n\nCopyright © 2024 Liu, Yin, Yang, Zhang, Wu, Zheng, Wu and Liu.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2024.1351908\nPMCID: PMC11165063\nPMID: 38863714 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest."

Intriguingly, modulation of DNA methylation by gut microbiota has \nbeen reported in preclinical models, although the relationship between \ntumor-infiltrating bacteria and CIMP status is currently unexplored. In this \nstudy, we investigated tumor-associated bacteria in 203 CRC tumor cases and \nvalidated the findings using The Cancer Genome Atlas datasets. We assessed the \nabundance of Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli, Fusobacterium nucleatum, \nand Klebsiella pneumoniae through qPCR analysis and observed enrichment of all \nfour bacterial species in CRC samples. Notably, except for E. coli, all \nexhibited significant enrichment in cases of CIMP. This enrichment was primarily \ndriven by a subset of cases distinguished by high levels of these bacteria, \nwhich we labeled as \"Superhigh\". The bacterial Superhigh status showed a \nsignificant association with CIMP (odds ratio 3.1, p-value = 0.013) and with \nMLH1 methylation (odds ratio 4.2, p-value = 0.0025). In TCGA CRC cases (393 \ntumor and 45 adj. normal), bacterial taxa information was extracted from \nnon-human whole exome sequencing reads, and the bacterial Superhigh status was \nsimilarly associated with CIMP (odds ratio 2.9, p < 0.001) and MLH1 methylation \n(odds ratio 3.5, p < 0.001). Finally, 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing revealed \nhigh enrichment of Bergeyella spp. C. concisus, and F. canifelinum in \nCIMP-Positive tumor cases.

Electronic address: \nDaniel.Nettersheim@med.uni-duesseldorf.de.\n\nGerm cell tumors (GCT) are the most common solid tumors in young men of age 15 - \n40. In previous studies, we profiled the interaction of GCT cells with cells of \nthe tumor microenvironment (TM), which showed that especially the 3D interaction \nof fibroblasts (FB) or macrophages with GCT cells influenced the growth behavior \nand cisplatin response as well as the transcriptome and secretome of the tumor \ncells, suggesting that the crosstalk of these cells with GCT cells is crucial \nfor tumor progression and therapy outcome. In this study, we shed light on the \nmechanisms of activation of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) in the GCT \nsetting and their effects on GCT cells lines and the monocyte cell line THP-1. \nEx vivo cultures of GCT-derived CAF were established and characterized \nmolecularly and epigenetically by performing DNA methylation arrays, RNA \nsequencing, and mass spectrometry-based secretome analysis. We demonstrated that \nthe activation state of CAF is influenced by their former prevailing tumor \nenvironment in which they have resided. Hereby, we postulate that seminoma (SE) \nand embryonal carcinoma (EC) activate CAF, while teratoma (TER) play only a \nminor role in CAF formation. In turn, CAF influence proliferation and the \nexpression of cisplatin sensitivity-related factors in GCT cells lines as well \nas polarization of in vitro-induced macrophages by the identified effector \nmolecules IGFBP1, LGALS3BP, LYVE1, and PTX3. Our data suggests that the vital \ninteraction of CAF with GCT cells and with macrophages has a huge influence on \nshaping the extracellular matrix as well as on recruitment of immune cells to \nthe TM. In conclusion, therapeutically interfering with CAF and / or macrophages \nin addition to the standard therapy might slow-down progression of GCT and \nre-shaping of the TM to a tumor-promoting environment. Significance: The \ninteraction of CAF with GCT and macrophages considerably influences the \nmicroenvironment. Thus, therapeutically interfering with CAF might slow-down \nprogression of GCT and re-shaping of the microenvironment to a tumor-promoting \nenvironment.\n\nCopyright © 2024.

It is \nhypothesized that epigenetic regulation by gut microbiota is a fundamental \ninterface by which commensal microbes dynamically influence intestinal biology. \nThe aim of this study is to explore the interplay between gut and tissue \nmicrobiota and host DNA methylation in CRC.\nMETHODS: Metagenomic sequencing of fecal samples was performed on matched CRC \npatients (n = 18) and healthy controls (n = 18). Additionally, tissue microbiome \nwas profiled with 16S rRNA gene sequencing on tumor (n = 24) and tumor-adjacent \nnormal (n = 24) tissues of CRC patients, while host DNA methylation was assessed \nthrough whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) in a subset of 13 individuals.\nRESULTS: Our analysis revealed substantial alterations in the DNA methylome of \nCRC tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues. An extensive meta-analysis, \nincorporating publicly available and in-house data, identified significant \nshifts in microbial-derived methyl donor-related pathways between tumor and \nadjacent normal tissues. Of note, we observed a pronounced enrichment of \nmicrobial-associated CpGs within the promoter regions of genes in adjacent \nnormal tissues, a phenomenon notably absent in tumor tissues. Furthermore, we \nestablished consistent and recurring associations between methylation patterns \nof tumor-related genes and specific bacterial taxa.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study emphasizes the pivotal role of the gut microbiota and \npathogenic bacteria in dynamically shaping DNA methylation patterns, impacting \nphysiological homeostasis, and contributing to CRC tumorigenesis. These findings \nprovide valuable insights into the intricate host-environment interactions in \nCRC development and offer potential avenues for therapeutic interventions in \nthis disease.\n\n© 2024.

We monitored the expression of PRDM14 in cells and patients using \nquantitative polymerase chain reaction, western blotting, and \nimmunohistochemistry. We observed that cell phenotypes and regulatory genes were \ninfluenced by PRDM14 by silencing PRDM14. We evaluated and validated the value \nof the PRDM14-derived prognostic model.

Here, we show, unlike most \ncancers, DNA of the TERT promoter is broadly hypomethylated in neuroblastoma. In \ntelomerase-positive neuroblastoma cells, the hypomethylated DNA promoter is \napproximately 1.5 kb. The TERT locus shows active chromatin marks with low \nenrichment for the repressive mark, H3K27me3. MYCN, a commonly amplified \noncogene in neuroblstoma, binds to the promoter and induces TERT expression. \nStrikingly, in neuroblastoma with long telomeres, the hypomethylated region \nspans the entire TERT locus, including multiple nearby genes with enrichment for \nthe repressive H3K27me3 chromatin mark. Furthermore, subtelomeric regions showed \nenrichment of repressive chromatin marks in neuroblastomas with long telomeres \nrelative to those with short telomeres. These repressive marks were even more \nevident at the genic loci, suggesting a telomere position effect (TPE). \nInhibiting H3K27 methylation by three different EZH2 inhibitors induced the \nexpression of TERT in cell lines with long telomeres and H3K27me3 marks in the \npromoter region. EZH2 inhibition facilitated MYCN binding to the TERT promoter \nin neuroblastoma cells with long telomeres. Taken together, these data suggest \nthat epigenetic regulation of TERT expression differs in neuroblastoma depending \non the telomere maintenance status, and H3K27 methylation is important in \nrepressing TERT expression in neuroblastoma with long telomeres.\nSIGNIFICANCE: The epigenetic landscape of the TERT locus is unique in \nneuroblastoma. The DNA at the TERT locus, unlike other cancer cells and similar \nto normal cells, are hypomethylated in telomerase-positive neuroblastoma cells. \nThe TERT locus is repressed by polycomb repressive complex-2 complex in \nneuroblastoma cells that have long telomeres and do not express TERT. Long \ntelomeres in neuroblastoma cells are also associated with repressive chromatin \nstates at the chromosomal termini, suggesting TPE.\n\n© 2024 The Authors; Published by the American Association for Cancer Research.\n\nDOI: 10.1158/2767-9764.CRC-22-0287\nPMCID: PMC11188873\nPMID: 38837897 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

We identified frequently mutated genes, \nincluding TP53, KMT2C, KMT2D, LRP1B, and FAT1. The most frequent mutation sites \nwere ALOX12B (c.1565C > T), SLX4 (c.2786C > T), LRIG1 (c.746A > G), and SPEN \n(c.6915_6917del) (6.5%). Pathway analysis revealed dysregulation of cell cycle \nregulation, epigenetic regulation, PI3K/AKT signaling, and NOTCH signaling. A \n17-mutated gene-related risk model was constructed using random survival forest \nanalysis and showed significant prognostic value in both our cohort and the \nvalidation cohort. Based on the Estimation of Stromal and Immune cells in \nMalignant Tumor tissues using Expression (ESTIMATE) algorithm, the Tumor Immune \nDysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) algorithm, and the MCPcounter algorithm, we \nfound that the risk score calculated by the risk model was significantly \ncorrelated with stimulatory immune checkpoints (TNFSF4, ITGB2, CXCL10, CXCL9, \nand BTN3A1; p < 0.05). Additionally, it was significantly associated with \nmarkers that are important in predicting response to immunotherapy (CD274, IFNG, \nand TAMM2; p < 0.05). Furthermore, the results of immunofluorescence double \nstaining showed that patients with high risk scores had a significantly higher \nlevel of M2 macrophage than those with low risk scores (p < 0.05). In \nconclusion, our study provides insights into the genomic landscape of ESCC and \nhighlights the prognostic value of a genomic mutation signature associated with \nthe immune microenvironment in southern Chinese patients with ESCC.\n\n© 2024.

This \nstudy aimed to further identify candidate biomarkers with prognostic and \ndiagnostic significance by integrating gene expression and DNA methylation data \nfrom PCa patients through association analysis.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: To this end, this paper proposes a sparse partial least \nsquares regression algorithm based on hypergraph regularization (HR-SPLS) by \nintegrating and clustering two kinds of data. Next, module 2, with the most \nsignificant weight, was selected for further analysis according to the weight of \neach module related to DNA methylation and mRNAs. Based on the DNA methylation \nsites in module 2, this paper uses multiple machine learning methods to \nconstruct a PCa diagnosis-related model of 10-DNA methylation sites.\nRESULTS: The results of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis showed \nthat the DNA methylation-related diagnostic model we constructed could diagnose \nPCa patients with high accuracy. Subsequently, based on the mRNAs in module 2, \nwe constructed a prognostic model for 7-mRNAs (MYH11, ACTG2, DDR2, CDC42EP3, \nMARCKSL1, LMOD1, and MYLK) using multivariate Cox regression analysis. The \nprognostic model could predict the disease free survival of PCa patients with \nmoderate to high accuracy (area under the curve (AUC) =0.761). In addition, Gene \nSet EnrichmentAnalysis (GSEA) and immune analysis indicated that the prognosis \nof patients in the risk group might be related to immune cell infiltration.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings may provide new methods and insights for identifying \ndisease-related biomarkers by integrating DNA methylation and gene expression \ndata.\n\nDOI: 10.18632/aging.205889\nPMCID: PMC11210239\nPMID: 38829766 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: CONFLICTS OF INTEREST: The authors declare that \nthey have no conflicts of interest."

The combination of radiotherapy with \nnimorazole has shown treatment benefit in HNSCC, but the precise underlying \nmolecular mechanisms remain unclear.\nPURPOSE: To assess and to characterize the transcriptomic/epigenetic landscape \nof HNSCC tumor models showing differential therapeutic response to fractionated \nradiochemotherapy (RCTx) combined with nimorazole.\nMATERIALS/METHODS: Bulk RNA-sequencing and DNA methylation experiments were \nconducted using untreated and treated HNSCC xenografts after 10 fractions of \nRCTx with and without nimorazole. These tumor models (FaDu, SAS, Cal33, SAT and \nUT-SCC-45) previously showed a heterogeneous response to RCTx with nimorazole. \nThe prognostic impact of candidate genes was assessed using clinical and gene \nexpression data from HNSCC patients treated with primary RCTx within the \nDKTK-ROG.\nRESULTS: Nimorazole responder and non-responder tumor models showed no \ndifferences in hypoxia gene signatures However, non-responder models showed \nupregulation of metabolic pathways. From that, a subset of 15 differentially \nexpressed genes stratified HNSCC patients into low and high-risk groups with \ndistinct outcome.\nCONCLUSION: In the present study, we found that nimorazole non-responder models \nwere characterized by upregulation of genes involved in Retinol metabolism and \nxenobiotic metabolic process pathways, which might contribute to identify \nmechanisms of resistance to nitroimidazole compounds and potentially expand the \nrepertoire of therapeutic options to treat HNSCC.\n\nCopyright © 2024 The Authors.

Here, we find that nucleotide \ndepletion and DNA replication stress drive differentiation in human and murine \nnormal and transformed hematopoietic systems, including patient-derived acute \nmyeloid leukemia (AML) xenografts. These cell state transitions begin during S \nphase and are independent of ATR/ATM checkpoint signaling, double-stranded DNA \nbreak formation, and changes in cell cycle length. In systems where \ndifferentiation is blocked by oncogenic transcription factor expression, \nreplication stress activates primed regulatory loci and induces \nlineage-appropriate maturation genes despite the persistence of progenitor \nprograms. Altering the baseline cell state by manipulating transcription factor \nexpression causes replication stress to induce genes specific for alternative \nlineages. The ability of replication stress to selectively activate primed \nmaturation programs across different contexts suggests a general mechanism by \nwhich changes in metabolism can promote lineage-appropriate cell state \ntransitions.\n\nCopyright © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

Considering \nthe diverse phenotypic landscape in BWSp, the characterization of the CDKN1C \nmolecular subtype remains relatively limited. Here, we investigate the role of \nCDKN1C in the broader BWSp phenotype. Notably, patients with CDKN1C variants \nappear to exhibit a different tumor risk than other BWSp molecular subtypes. We \nperformed a comprehensive literature review using the search term \"CDKN1C \nBeckwith\" to identify 113 cases of patients with molecularly confirmed \nCDKN1C-BWSp. We then assessed the genotype and phenotype in a novel cohort of \npatients with CDKN1C-BWSp enrolled in the BWS Research Registry. Cardinal and \nsuggestive features were evaluated for all patients reported, and tumor risk was \nestablished based on available reports. The most common phenotypes included \nmacroglossia, omphalocele, and ear creases/pits. Tumor types reported from the \nliterature included neuroblastoma, acute lymphocytic leukemia, superficial \nspreading melanoma, and intratubular germ cell neoplasia. Overall, this study \nidentifies unique features associated with CDKN1C variants in BWSp, enabling \nmore accurate clinical management. The absence of Wilms tumor and hepatoblastoma \nsuggests that screening for these tumors may not be necessary, while the \nneuroblastoma risk warrants appropriate screening recommendations.\n\n© 2024 The Author(s).

Recently, we tested a set of 15 published \ncervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 or worse (CIN3+)-specific methylation \nmarkers and found a panel of 3 markers with a sensitivity of 82% and a \nspecificity of 74%. In this study, we determined the sensitivity and specificity \nof 2 commercial assays using quantitative methylation-specific PCR. DNA from the \nsame cohort of high-risk human papillomavirus-positive self-sampled material \nobtained through the population-based screening program in the North of the \nNetherlands from women with CIN2 or less (<CIN3, n = 208) and women with CIN3+ \n(n = 96) was used. The QIAsure methylation test (consisting of 2 methylation \nmarkers) showed a sensitivity of 65% and a specificity of 72%, whereas the \nGyntect assay (consisting of 6 methylation markers) showed a sensitivity of 59% \nand a specificity of 91% for CIN3+. When we compared all individual 23 \nmethylation markers, receiver operating characteristic analysis showed an area \nunder the curve of ≥0.7 for 11 of 23 markers (P < .001). By model-based \nrecursive partitioning and robustness analysis, we found a panel with a better \nsensitivity compared with QIAsure and Gyntect (P < .001). This new panel, \nconsisting of ITGA4, ASCL1, and FAM19A4, has a sensitivity of 84% and a \nspecificity of 70%, similar to our previously identified panel (ANKRD18CP, LHX8, \nand EPB41L3). Thus, in addition to our previously identified panel, the \ncombination of ITGA4, ASCL1, and FAM19A4 showed good diagnostic performance and \npotentially can replace cytology, thereby avoiding additional doctor visits for \nmany women worldwide and reducing the time for decision making for referral to \nthe gynecologist.\n\nCopyright © 2024 The Authors.

The focus was on the role of MAGI2-AS3, \ndelivered by BMSC-EVs, in regulating USP6NL DNA methylation-mediated MYC protein \ntranslation modification to promote CDK2 downregulation. Utilizing \nbioinformatics analysis, we identified significant enrichment of MAGI2-AS3 \nrelated to copper-induced cell death in CRC. In vitro experiments demonstrated \nthe downregulation of MAGI2-AS3 in CRC cells, and BMSC-EVs were found to deliver \nMAGI2-AS3 to inhibit CRC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Further \nexploration revealed that MAGI2-AS3 suppressed MYC protein translation \nmodification by regulating USP6NL DNA methylation, leading to CDK2 \ndownregulation and prevention of colorectal cancer. Overexpression of MYC \nreversed the functional effects of BMSC-EVs-MAGI2-AS3. In vivo experiments \nvalidated the inhibitory impact of BMSC-EVs-MAGI2-AS3 on CRC tumorigenicity by \npromoting CDK2 downregulation through USP6NL DNA methylation-mediated MYC \nprotein translation modification. Overall, BMSC-EVs-MAGI2-AS3 may serve as a \npotential intervention to prevent CRC occurrence by modulating key molecular \npathways.\n\nCopyright © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

China.\n\nPancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most aggressive \nmalignancies, with a notoriously dismal prognosis. As a competitive inhibitor of \nDNA synthesis, gemcitabine is the cornerstone drug for treating PDAC at all \nstages. The therapeutic effect of gemcitabine, however, is often hindered by \ndrug resistance, and the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. It is \nunclear whether their response to chemotherapeutics is regulated by endocrine \nregulators, despite the association between PDAC risk and endocrine \nderegulation. Here, we show that prolactin receptor (PRLR) synergizes with \ngemcitabine in both in vitro and in vivo treatment of PDAC. Interestingly, PRLR \npromotes the expression of miR-4763-3p and miR-3663-5p, two novel miRNAs whose \nfunctions are unknown. Furthermore, the analysis of transcriptome sequencing \ndata of tumors from lactating mouse models enriches the PPP pathway, a \nmultifunctional metabolic pathway. In addition to providing energy, the PPP \npathway mainly provides a variety of raw materials for anabolism. We demonstrate \nthat two key enzymes of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), G6PD and TKT, are \ndirectly targeted by miR-4763-3p and miR-3663-5p. Notably, miR-4763-3p and \nmiR-3663-5p diminish the nucleotide synthesis of the PPP pathway, thereby \nincreasing gemcitabine sensitivity. As a result, PRLR harnesses these two miRNAs \nto suppress PPP and nucleotide synthesis, subsequently elevating the gemcitabine \nsensitivity of PDAC cells. Also, PDAC tissues and tumors from LSL-KrasG12D/+, \nLSL-Trp53R172H/+, and PDX1-cre (KPC) mice exhibit downregulation of PRLR. \nBisulfite sequencing of PDAC tissues revealed that PRLR downregulation is due to \nepigenetic methylation. In this study, we show for the first time that the \nendocrine receptor PRLR improves the effects of gemcitabine by boosting two new \nmiRNAs that block the PPP pathway and nucleotide synthesis by inhibiting two \nessential enzymes concurrently. The PRLR-miRNAs-PPP axis may serve as a possible \ntherapeutic target to supplement chemotherapy advantages in PDAC.\n\n© 2024 Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology.\n\nDOI: 10.1096/fj.202302287RR\nPMID: 38805171 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

With \nthe further study of the mechanism of gut microbiota, significant progress has \nbeen made in the study of the link between gut microbiota and epigenetics. This \nstudy visualizes the body of knowledge and research priorities between the gut \nmicrobiota and epigenetics through bibliometrics.\nMETHODS: Publications related to gut microbiota and epigenetics were searched in \nthe Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database. Vosviewer 1.6.17 and \nCiteSpace 6.1.R2 were used for bibliometric analysis.\nRESULTS: WoSCC includes 460 articles from 71 countries. The number of \npublications on gut microbiota and epigenetics has increased each year since \n2011. The USA, PEOPLES R CHINA, and ITALY are at the center of this field of \nresearch. The University of California System, Harvard University, and the \nUniversity of London are the main research institutions. Li, X, Yu, Q, Zhang, S \nX are the top authors in this research field. We found that current research \nhotspots and frontiers include short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) play an important \nrole in gut microbiota and epigenetic mechanisms, gut microbiota and epigenetics \nplay an important role in host obesity, diet, and metabolism. Gut microbiota and \nepigenetics are closely related to colorectal cancer, breast cancer, and \ninflammatory bowel disease. At the same time, we found that gut microbiota \nregulates epigenetics through the gut-brain axis and has an impact on \npsychiatric diseases. Therefore, probiotics can regulate gut microbiota, improve \nlifestyle, and reduce the occurrence and development of diseases.\nCONCLUSION: This is the first comprehensive and in-depth bibliometric study of \ntrends and developments in the field of gut microbiota and epigenetics research. \nThis study helps to guide the direction of research scholars in their current \nfield of study.\n\nCopyright © 2024 Tian and Chen.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2024.1412640\nPMCID: PMC11128553\nPMID: 38803501 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest."

In recent \nyears, dietary prevention of BC with epigenetically active phytochemicals has \nreceived increased attention due to its feasibility, effectiveness, and ease of \nimplementation. In this regard, combinatorial phytochemical intervention enables \nmore efficacious BC inhibition by simultaneously targeting multiple tumorigenic \npathways. We, therefore, focused on investigation of the effect of sulforaphane \n(SFN)-rich broccoli sprouts (BSp) and withaferin A (WA)-rich Ashwagandha (Ash) \ncombination on BC prevention in estrogen receptor-negative [ER(-)] mammary \ncancer using transgenic mice. Our results indicated that combinatorial BSp + Ash \ntreatment significantly reduced tumor incidence and tumor growth (~ 75%) as well \nas delayed (~ 21%) tumor latency when compared to the control treatment and \ncombinatorial BSp + Ash treatment was statistically more effective in \nsuppressing BC compared to single BSp or Ash intervention. At the molecular \nlevel, the BSp and Ash combination upregulated tumor suppressors (p53, p57) \nalong with apoptosis associated proteins (BAX, PUMA) and BAX:BCL-2 ratio. \nFurthermore, our result indicated an expressional decline of epigenetic \nmachinery HDAC1 and DNMT3A in mammary tumor tissue because of combinatorial \ntreatment. Interestingly, we have reported multiple synergistic interactions \nbetween BSp and Ash that have impacted both tumor phenotype and molecular \nexpression due to combinatorial BSp and Ash treatment. Our RNA-seq analysis \nresults also demonstrated a transcriptome-wide expressional reshuffling of genes \nassociated with multiple cell-signaling pathways, transcription factor activity \nand epigenetic regulations due to combined BSp and Ash administration. In \naddition, we discovered an alteration of gut microbial composition change \nbecause of combinatorial treatment. Overall, combinatorial BSp and Ash \nsupplementation can prevent ER(-) BC through enhanced tumor suppression, \napoptosis induction and transcriptome-wide reshuffling of gene expression \npossibly influencing multiple cell signaling pathways, epigenetic regulation and \nreshaping gut microbiota.\n\n© 2024.

Most show a classical tripartite morphology (different from seminoma) and \nare benign. However, well-documented cases of malignant spermatocytic tumors \nexist. Our previous work showed that a subset of spermatocytic tumors exhibiting \nTP53 mutations, DNA methylation profiles closer to seminomas, and/or gains in \nchromosome 12p exhibited aggressive characteristics, including sarcomatoid \ntransformation and metastatic dissemination. The microRNA-371-373 cluster is a \npromising biomarker which is upregulated in non-teratoma germ cell tumors with \nmalignant behavior. In this work we analyze microRNAs-371-373 b y quantitative \nreal-time polymerase chain reaction in 18 spermatocytic tumors representative of \nthe whole clinical spectrum, including 6 with aggressive features (sarcomatoid \ntransformation, metastases, or gains in chromosome 12p). The levels of \nmicroRNAs-371-373 were significantly higher in non-teratoma germ cell tumors \ncompared to spermatocytic tumors, overall (p < 0.0001). Importantly, levels of \nmicroRNA-371-373 were higher in spermatocytic tumors with aggressive features \ncompared to non-aggressive neoplasms. The highest levels were observed in one \ntumor showing isochromosome 12p. These results further support our previous \nfindings that a subset of spermatocytic tumors are intermediate between \nso-called type II and type III germ cell tumors and that embryonic microRNAs \nplay a role in aggressive behavior in spermatocytic tumors. Accordingly, this \nsubset of tumors may behave aggressively and require close follow up. In the \nfuture, this opens an opportunity for microRNA testing in serum of spermatocytic \ntumor patients for risk stratification purposes.\n\nCopyright © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

Coiled-coil domain containing 12 gene (CCDC12) \nimplicated in tumorigenesis. This study aims to investigate the potential of \nblood-based CCDC12 methylation for breast cancer detection.\nMETHODS: DNA methylation level of CpG sites (Cytosine-phosphate Guanine \ndinucleotides) in CCDC12 gene was measured by mass spectrometry in 255 breast \ncancer patients, 155 patients with benign breast nodules and 302 healthy \ncontrols. The association between CCDC12 methylation and breast cancer risk was \nevaluated by logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic curve \nanalysis.\nRESULTS: A total of eleven CpG sites were analyzed. The CCDC12 methylation \nlevels were higher in breast cancer patients. Compared to the lowest tertile of \nmethylation level in CpG_6,7, CpG_10 and CpG_11, the highest quartile was \nassociated with 82, 91 and 95% increased breast cancer risk, respectively. The \nCCDC12 methylation levels were associated with estrogen receptor (ER) and human \nepidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) status. In ER-negative and HER2-positive \n(ER-/HER2+) breast cancer subtype, the combination of four sites CpG_2, CpG_5, \nCpG_6,7 and CpG_11 methylation levels could distinguish ER-/HER2+ breast cancer \nfrom the controls (AUC = 0.727).\nCONCLUSION: The hypermethylation levels of CCDC12 in peripheral blood could be \nused for breast cancer detection.\n\nPlain Language Summary: Breast cancer detection could be facilitated by novel \nblood-based DNA methylation biomarkers.The methylation levels of CpG sites in \nCCDC12 were higher in breast cancer than those in controls.The combination of \nfour sites CpG_2, CpG_5, CpG_6,7 and CpG_11 methylation levels could distinguish \nER-/HER2+ breast cancer subtype from the controls.\n\nDOI: 10.1080/1354750X.2024.2358302\nPMID: 38776382 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

This \nstudy assessed the relationship between vitamin B12 intake and all-cause and \ncancer-specific mortality among CRC patients. We analyzed data from the NHANES \nfrom 1999 to 2018, using multivariable Cox regression, competing risk model, \nKaplan-Meier survival curves, and stratified analysis with interaction effects. \nThe studied involved 4,554 cancer patients (mean age 65.8 years, 47.6% males). \nResults from multivariate Cox regression indicated that each additional \n1 mcg/day of dietary vitamin B12 independently increased the risk of all-cause \n(HR, 1.07; 95% CI: 1.04-1.09, p < 0.001) and cancer-specific mortality (HR, \n1.04; 95% CI, 1.02-1.06; p < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier curves indicated a higher risk \nof all-cause mortality with increased vitamin B12 intake (Log rank p = 0.01). \nSubgroup analysis suggested that higher vitamin B12 intake correlated with \nincreased all-cause mortality risk, especially in individuals with higher \nprotein (HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.02-1.06; p = 0.019) or carbohydrate intake (HR, \n1.03; 95% CI, 1.01-1.05; p = 0.04). Thus, higher vitamin B12 intake correlates \nwith increased all-cause and cancer-specific mortality in CRC patients, \nparticularly those with higher protein or carbohydrate intake.\n\nDOI: 10.1080/01635581.2024.2353938\nPMID: 38775076 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

The characteristics of function and composition in the \ngut microbiota of patients with breast cancer patients has been reported, \nhowever the detailed causation between gut microbiota and breast cancer remains \nuncertain. In the present study, 16S rRNA sequencing revealed that Prevotella, \nparticularly the dominant species Prevotella copri, is significantly enriched \nand prevalent in gut microbiota of breast cancer patients. Prior-oral \nadministration of P. copri could promote breast cancer growth in specific \npathogen-free mice and germ-free mice, accompanied with sharp reduction of \nindole-3-pyruvic acid (IPyA). Mechanistically, the present of excessive P. copri \nconsumed a large amount of tryptophan (Trp), thus hampering the physiological \naccumulation of IPyA in the host. Our results revealed that IPyA is an intrinsic \nanti-cancer reagent in the host at physiological level. Briefly, IPyA directly \nsuppressed the transcription of UHRF1, following by the declined UHRF1 and PP2A \nC in nucleus, thus inhibiting the phosphorylation of AMPK, which is just \nopposite to the cancer promoting effect of P. copri. Therefore, the exhaustion \nof IPyA by excessive P. copri strengthens the UHRF1-mediated negative control to \ninactivated the energy-controlling AMPK signaling pathway to promote tumor \ngrowth, which was indicated by the alternation in pattern of protein expression \nand DNA methylation. Our findings, for the first time, highlighted P. copri as a \nrisk factor for the progression of breast cancer.\n\nDOI: 10.1080/19490976.2024.2347757\nPMCID: PMC11123460\nPMID: 38773738 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: No potential conflict of interest was reported \nby the author(s)."

Although the prognosis is good, one-third has a primary \nrefractory or relapsing disease which underscores the importance of developing \npredictive biological markers capable of identifying high- and low-risk \npatients. DNA methylation (DNAm) and telomere maintenance alterations are \nhallmarks of cancer and aging. Both these alterations may contribute to the \nheterogeneity of the disease, and potentially influence the prognosis of LBCL.\nRESULTS: We studied the DNAm profiles (Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip) and \nrelative telomere lengths (RTL) with qPCR of 93 LBCL cases: Diffuse large B-cell \nlymphoma not otherwise specified (DLBCL, n = 66), High-grade B-cell lymphoma \n(n = 7), Primary CNS lymphoma (n = 8), and transformation of indolent B-cell \nlymphoma (n = 12). There was a substantial methylation heterogeneity in DLBCL \nand other LBCL entities compared to normal cells and other B-cell neoplasms. \nLBCL cases had a particularly aberrant semimethylated pattern (0.15 ≤ β ≤ 0.8) \nwith large intertumor variation and overall low hypermethylation (β > 0.8). DNAm \npatterns could not be used to distinguish between germinal center B-cell-like \n(GC) and non-GC DLBCL cases. In cases treated with R-CHOP-like regimens, a high \npercentage of global hypomethylation (β < 0.15) was in multivariable analysis \nassociated with worse disease-specific survival (DSS) (HR 6.920, 95% \nCI 1.499-31.943) and progression-free survival (PFS) (HR 4.923, 95% \nCI 1.286-18.849) in DLBCL and with worse DSS (HR 5.147, 95% CI 1.239-21.388) in \nLBCL. These cases with a high percentage of global hypomethylation also had a \nhigher degree of CpG island methylation, including islands in \npromoter-associated regions, than the cases with less hypomethylation. \nAdditionally, telomere length was heterogenous in LBCL, with a subset of the \nDLBCL-GC cases accounting for the longest RTL. Short RTL was independently \nassociated with worse DSS (HR 6.011, 95% CI 1.319-27.397) and PFS (HR 4.689, 95% \nCI 1.102-19.963) in LBCL treated with R-CHOP-like regimens.\nCONCLUSION: We hypothesize that subclones with high global hypomethylation and \nhypermethylated CpG islands could have advantages in tumor progression, e.g. by \ninactivating tumor suppressor genes or promoting treatment resistance. Our \nfindings suggest that cases with high global hypomethylation and thus poor \nprognosis could be candidates for alternative treatment regimens including \nhypomethylating drugs.\n\n© 2024.

Somatic mutational and DNA \nmethylation (DNAm) clocks are promising tools to molecularly track mitotic age, \nyet their relationship is underexplored and their potential for cancer risk \nprediction in normal tissues remains to be demonstrated. Here we build and \nvalidate an improved pan-tissue DNAm counter of total mitotic age called \nstemTOC. We demonstrate that stemTOC's mitotic age proxy increases with the \ntumor cell-of-origin fraction in each of 15 cancer-types, in precancerous \nlesions, and in normal tissues exposed to major cancer risk factors. Extensive \nbenchmarking against 6 other mitotic counters shows that stemTOC compares \nfavorably, specially in the preinvasive and normal-tissue contexts. By \ncross-correlating stemTOC to two clock-like somatic mutational signatures, we \nconfirm the mitotic-like nature of only one of these. Our data points towards \nDNAm as a promising molecular substrate for detecting mitotic-age increases in \nnormal tissues and precancerous lesions, and hence for developing cancer-risk \nprediction strategies.\n\n© 2024.

To identify potential biomarkers and molecular targets and understand \nhow they impact disease outcomes, it is important to identify key groups of \nCNAs, the associated methylation, and the gene expressions they impact, through \na joint integrative analysis. Here, we propose a novel analysis pipeline, the \njoint sparse canonical correlation analysis (jsCCA), an extension of sCCA, to \neffectively identify an ensemble of CNAs, methylation sites and gene \n(expression) components in the context of disease endpoints, especially tumor \ncharacteristics. Our approach detects potentially orthogonal gene components \nthat are highly correlated with sets of methylation sites which in turn are \ncorrelated with sets of CNA sites. It then identifies the genes within these \ncomponents that are associated with the outcome. Further, we aggregate the \neffect of each gene expression set on tumor stage by constructing \"gene \ncomponent scores\" and test its interaction with traditional risk factors. \nAnalyzing clinical and genomic data on 515 renal clear cell carcinoma (ccRCC) \npatients from the TCGA-KIRC, we found eight gene components to be associated \nwith methylation sites, regulated by groups of proximally located CNA sites. \nAssociation analysis with tumor stage at diagnosis identified a novel \nassociation of expression of ASAH1 gene trans-regulated by methylation of \nseveral genes including SIX5 and by CNAs in the 10q25 region including TCF7L2. \nFurther analysis to quantify the overall effect of gene sets on tumor stage, \nrevealed that two of the eight gene components have significant interaction with \nsmoking in relation to tumor stage. These gene components represent distinct \nbiological functions including immune function, inflammatory responses, and \nhypoxia-regulated pathways. Our findings suggest that jsCCA analysis can \nidentify interpretable and important genes, regulatory structures, and \nclinically consequential pathways. Such methods are warranted for comprehensive \nanalysis of multimodal data especially in cancer genomics.\n\n© 2024 The Authors.

We aimed to develop a blood-based assay to aid in the \ndiagnosis, detection and prognostic evaluation of HCC.\nMETHODS: A three-phase multicentre study was conducted to screen, optimise and \nvalidate HCC-specific differentially methylated regions (DMRs) using \nnext-generation sequencing and quantitative methylation-specific PCR (qMSP).\nRESULTS: Genome-wide methylation profiling was conducted to identify DMRs \ndistinguishing HCC tumours from peritumoural tissues and healthy plasmas. The \ntwenty most effective DMRs were verified and incorporated into a multilocus qMSP \nassay (HepaAiQ). The HepaAiQ model was trained to separate 293 HCC patients \n(Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage 0/A, 224) from 266 controls \nincluding chronic hepatitis B (CHB) or liver cirrhosis (LC) (CHB/LC, 96), benign \nhepatic lesions (BHL, 23), and healthy controls (HC, 147). The model achieved an \narea under the curve (AUC) of 0.944 with a sensitivity of 86.0% in HCC and a \nspecificity of 92.1% in controls. Blind validation of the HepaAiQ model in a \ncohort of 523 participants resulted in an AUC of 0.940 with a sensitivity of \n84.4% in 205 HCC cases (BCLC stage 0/A, 167) and a specificity of 90.3% in 318 \ncontrols (CHB/LC, 100; BHL, 102; HC, 116). When evaluated in an independent test \nset, the HepaAiQ model exhibited a sensitivity of 70.8% in 65 HCC patients at \nBCLC stage 0/A and a specificity of 89.5% in 124 patients with CHB/LC. Moreover, \nHepaAiQ model was assessed in paired pre- and postoperative plasma samples from \n103 HCC patients and correlated with 2-year patient outcomes. Patients with high \npostoperative HepaAiQ score showed a higher recurrence risk (Hazard ratio, 3.33, \np < .001).\nCONCLUSIONS: HepaAiQ, a noninvasive qMSP assay, was developed to accurately \nmeasure HCC-specific DMRs and shows great potential for the diagnosis, detection \nand prognosis of HCC, benefiting at-risk populations.\n\n© 2024 The Author(s).

Simple \nand objective tools to reliably detect women with EC are urgently needed. We \nrecently developed and validated the DNA methylation (DNAme)-based women's \ncancer risk identification-quantitative polymerase chain reaction test for \nendometrial cancer (WID-qEC) test that could address this need. Here, we \ndemonstrate that the stability of the WID-qEC test remains consistent regardless \nof: (i) the cervicovaginal collection device and sample media used (Cervex brush \nand PreservCyt or FLOQSwab and eNAT), (ii) the collector of the specimen \n(gynaecologist- or patient-based), and (iii) the precise sampling site \n(cervical, cervicovaginal and vaginal). Furthermore, we demonstrate sample \nstability in eNAT medium for 7 days at room temperature, greatly facilitating \nthe implementation of the test into diagnostic laboratory workflows. When \napplying FLOQSwabs (Copan) in combination with the eNAT (Copan) sample \ncollection media, the sensitivity and specificity of the WID-qEC test to detect \nuterine (i.e., endometrial and cervical) cancers in gynaecologist-taken samples \nwas 92.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 75.0%-98.8%) and 98.6% (95% \nCI = 91.7%-99.9%), respectively, whilst the sensitivity and specificity in \npatient collected self-samples was 75.0% (95% CI = 47.4%-91.7%) and 100.0% (95% \nCI = 93.9%-100.0%), respectively. Taken together these data confirm the \nrobustness and clinical potential of the WID-qEC test.\n\n© 2024 The Authors.

We utilized data from a random population sample of 9,360 individuals \n(men and women, aged 45-69) from the HAPIEE Study who had been followed up for \n16 years. A nested case-control design yielded 35 incident CRC cases and 354 \nmatched controls. Six baseline epigenetic age (EA) measures (Horvath, Hannum, \nPhenoAge, Skin and Blood (SB), BLUP, and Elastic Net (EN)) were calculated along \nwith their respective EAAs. After adjustment, the odds ratios (ORs) for CRC risk \nper decile increase in EAA ranged from 1.20 (95% CI: 1.04-1.39) to 1.44 (95% CI: \n1.21-1.76) for the Horvath, Hannum, PhenoAge, and BLUP measures. Conversely, the \nSB and EN EAA measures showed borderline inverse associations with ORs of \n0.86-0.87 (95% CI: 0.76-0.99). Tertile analysis reinforced a positive \nassociation between CRC risk and four EAA measures (Horvath, Hannum, PhenoAge, \nand BLUP) and a modest inverse relationship with EN EAA. Our findings from a \nprospective population-based-case-control study indicate a direct association \nbetween incident CRC and four markers of accelerated baseline epigenetic age. In \ncontrast, two markers showed a negative association or no association. These \nresults warrant further exploration in larger cohorts and may have implications \nfor CRC risk assessment and prevention.\n\nDOI: 10.3390/ijms25094850\nPMCID: PMC11084311\nPMID: 38732069 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare no conflicts of interest."

In \nthis context, we focused on the potential use of epigenetic data in clinical \nmanagement to aid in diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making. First, we used \nthe F-36P MDS cell line to establish an azacitidine-resistant F-36P cell line. \nWe performed expression profiling of azacitidine-resistant and parental F-36P \ncells and used biological and bioinformatics approaches to analyze candidate \nazacitidine-resistance-related genes and pathways. Eighty candidate genes were \nidentified and found to encode proteins previously linked to cancer, chronic \nmyeloid leukemia, and transcriptional misregulation in cancer. Interestingly, 24 \nof the candidate genes had promoter methylation patterns that were inversely \ncorrelated with azacitidine resistance, suggesting that DNA methylation status \nmay contribute to azacitidine resistance. In particular, the DNA methylation \nstatus and/or mRNA expression levels of the four genes (AMER1, HSPA2, NCX1, and \nTNFRSF10C) may contribute to the clinical effects of azacitidine in MDS.

Therefore, \nit is essential to identify biomarkers associated with metastasis and recurrence \nin CRC. DNA methylation has a regulatory role in cancer metastasis, tumor immune \nmicroenvironment (TME), and prognosis and may be one of the most valuable \nbiomarkers for predicting CRC metastasis and prognosis. We constructed a \ndiagnostic model and nomogram that can effectively predict CRC metastasis based \non the differential methylation CpG sites (DMCs) between metastatic and \nnon-metastatic CRC patients. Then, we identified 17 DMCs associated with \nprogression free survival (PFS) of CRC and constructed a prognostic model. The \nprognosis model based on 17 DMCs can predict the PFS of CRC with medium to high \naccuracy. The results of immunohistochemical analysis indicated that the protein \nexpression levels of the genes involved in prognostic DMCs were different \nbetween normal and colorectal cancer tissues. According to the results of \nimmune-related analysis, we found that the low-risk patients had better \nimmunotherapy response. In addition, high risk scores were negatively correlated \nwith high tumor mutation burden (TMB) levels, and patients with low TMB levels \nin the high-risk group had the worst PFS. Our work shows the clinical value of \nDNA methylation in predicting CRC metastasis and PFS, as well as their \ncorrelation with TME, immunotherapy, and TMB, which helps understand the changes \nof DNA methylation in CRC metastasis and improving the treatment and prognosis \nof CRC.\n\n© 2024.

Nevertheless, few studies have been \nconducted to investigate the impact of RNA editing on cervical squamous cell \ncarcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma (CESC). In order to study the \nconnection between RNA editing and CESC patients' prognoses, we obtained \nCESC-related information from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and \nrandomly allocated the patients into the training group or testing group. An RNA \nediting-based risk model for CESC patients was established by Cox regression \nanalysis and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). According \nto the median score generated by this RNA editing-based risk model, patients \nwere categorized into subgroups with high and low risks. We further constructed \nthe nomogram by risk scores and clinical characteristics and analyzed the impact \nof RNA editing levels on host gene expression levels and adenosine deaminase \nacting on RNA. Finally, we also compared the biological functions and pathways \nof differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between different subgroups by \nenrichment analysis. In this risk model, we screened out 6 RNA editing sites \nwith significant prognostic value. The constructed nomogram performed well in \nforecasting patients' prognoses. Furthermore, the level of RNA editing at the \nprognostic site exhibited a strong correlation with host gene expression. In the \nhigh-risk subgroup, we observed multiple biological functions and pathways \nassociated with immune response, cell proliferation, and tumor progression.

We examined the \nassociation of mZNF331 with clinicopathologic features, relapse, survival, and \ntreatment efficacy in patients with stage III colon cancer treated within a \nrandomized adjuvant chemotherapy trial (CALGB/Alliance89803).

Histopathologic features were \nlargely similar between patients with mZNF331 compared to unmethylated ZNF331 \n(unmZNFF31). There was no significant difference in disease-free or overall \nsurvival between patients with mZNF331 versus unmZNF331 colon cancers, even when \nadjusting for clinicopathologic features and molecular marker status. Similarly, \nthere was no difference in disease-free or overall survival across treatment \narms when stratified by ZNF331 methylation status. While ZNF331 promoter \nhypermethylation is frequently observed in CRC, our current study of a small \nsubset of patients with stage III colon cancer suggests limited applicability as \na prognostic marker.

This study aimed to explore the mechanisms and applications \nof these genes across diverse cancer types. We analyzed profiling data from over \n10,000 individuals, covering 33 cancer types, 750 small molecule drugs, and 24 \nimmune cell types. We focused on DCBLD2's function at the single-cell level and \ncomputed an iAge-CRG score using GSVA. This score was correlated with cancer \npathways, immune infiltration, and survival. A signature was then derived using \nunivariate Cox and LASSO regression, followed by ROC curve analysis, nomogram \nconstruction, decision curve analysis, and immunocytochemistry. Our \ncomprehensive analysis revealed epigenetic, genomic, and immunogenomic \nalterations in iAge-CRGs, especially DCBLD2, leading to abnormal expression. \nAberrant DCBLD2 expression strongly correlated with cancer-associated fibroblast \ninfiltration and prognosis in multiple cancers. Based on GSVA results, we \ndeveloped a risk model using five iAge-CRGs, which proved to be an independent \nprognostic index for uveal melanoma (UVM) patients. We also systematically \nevaluated the correlation between the iAge-related signature risk score and \nimmune cell infiltration. iAge-CRGs, particularly DCBLD2, emerge as potential \ntargets for enhancing immunotherapy outcomes. The strong correlation between \nabnormal DCBLD2 expression, cancer-associated fibroblast infiltration, and \npatient survival across various cancers underscores their significance. Our \nfive-gene risk signature offers an independent prognostic tool for UVM patients, \nhighlighting the crucial role of these genes in suppressing the immune response \nin UVM.Kindly check and confirm whether the corresponding affiliation is \ncorrectly identified.I identified the affiliation is correctly.thank you.Per \nstyle, a structured abstract is not allowed so we have changed the structured \nabstract to an unstructured abstract.

Early intervention can significantly improve \nprognosis. DNA methylation could occur in the early stage of tumor. \nComprehensive understanding the epigenetic landscape of early-stage LUAD is \ncrucial in understanding tumorigenesis.\nMETHODS: Enzymatic methyl sequencing (EM-seq) was performed on 23 tumors and \npaired normal tissue to reveal distinct epigenetic landscape, for compared with \nThe Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) 450K methylation microarray data. Then, an \nintegrative analysis was performed combined with TCGA LUAD RNA-seq data to \nidentify significant differential methylated and expressed genes. Subsequently, \nthe prognostic risk model was constructed and cellular composition was analyzed.\nRESULTS: Methylome analysis of EM-seq comparing tumor and normal tissues \nidentified 25 million cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites and 30,187 \ndifferentially methylated regions (DMR) with a greater number of untraditional \ntypes. EM-seq identified a significantly higher number of CpG sites and DMRs \ncompared to the 450K microarray. By integrating the differentially methylated \ngenes (DMGs) with LUAD-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from the \nTCGA database, we constructed prognostic model based on six differentially \nmethylated-expressed genes (MEGs) and verified our prognostic model in GSE13213 \nand GSE42127 dataset. Finally, cell deconvolution based on the in-house EM-seq \nmethylation profile was used to estimate cellular composition of early-stage \nLUAD.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study firstly delves into novel pattern of epigenomic DNA \nmethylation and provides a multidimensional analysis of the role of DNA \nmethylation revealed by EM-seq in early-stage LUAD, providing distinctive \ninsights into its potential epigenetic mechanisms.\n\n© 2024.

Although cancer cells are molecularly \nheterogeneous, we hypothesized convergent adaptive strategies to common host \nselection forces can be inferred from patterns of epigenetic and genetic \nevolutionary selection in similar tumors. We systematically investigated gene \nmutations and expression changes in lung adenocarcinomas with no common driver \ngenes (n = 313). Although 13,461 genes were mutated in at least one sample, only \n376 non-synonymous mutations evidenced positive evolutionary selection with \nconservation of 224 genes, while 1736 and 2430 genes exhibited ≥ two-fold \nincreased and ≥ 50% decreased expression, respectively. Mutations under positive \nselection are more frequent in genes with significantly altered expression \nsuggesting they often \"hardwire\" pre-existing epigenetically driven adaptations. \nConserved genes averaged 16-fold higher expression in normal lung tissue \ncompared to those with selected mutations demonstrating pathways necessary for \nboth normal cell function and optimal cancer cell fitness. The convergent LUAD \nphenotype exhibits loss of differentiated functions and cell-cell interactions \ngoverning tissue organization. Conservation with increased expression is found \nin genes associated with cell cycle, DNA repair, p53 pathway, epigenetic \nmodifiers, and glucose metabolism. No canonical driver gene pathways exhibit \nstrong positive selection, but extensive down-regulation of membrane ion \nchannels suggests decreased transmembrane potential may generate persistent \nproliferative signals. NCD LUADs perform niche construction generating a stiff, \nimmunosuppressive microenvironment through selection of specific collagens and \nproteases. NCD LUADs evolve to a convergent phenotype through a network of \ninterconnected genetic, epigenetic, and ecological pathways.\n\n© 2024.

Epigenetic \nchanges, such as deregulation of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and microRNA \n(miR), have been linked to the advancement of CC; however, the effects of high \nglucose levels on their deregulation and, in turn, colon cancer remain \nunexplored.\nMETHODS: Fifty patients had a dual diagnosis of CC and T2DM, and 60 patients \nwith CC without diabetes mellitus were included in the study. qRT-PCR was used \nto examine the expression of lncRNA ANRIL and miR-186-5p in tissue samples. \nANRIL, miR-186-5p, and their downstream target genes HIF-1α, PFK, HK, Bcl-2, and \nBax were also determined in CC cell lines under various glucose conditions. \nGlucose uptake, lactate production and cells proliferation were estimated in CC \ncell lines.\nRESULTS: A significant upregulation of ANRIL expression levels (p<0.001) and a \nsignificant downregulation of miR-186-5p expression (p<0.001) in diabetic colon \ncancer specimens compared to those in non-diabetic colon cancer group were \nobserved. MiR-186-5p expression levels were inversely correlated with ANRIL \nexpression levels, blood glucose levels and HbA1c%. Concerning in vitro model, a \nsignificant upregulation of ANRIL, downregulation of miR-186-5p, upregulation of \nHIF-1α, glycolytic enzymes and activation of antiapoptotic pathway was detected \nin higher glucose concentrations than lower one. There was a significant \nincrease of glucose uptake, lactate accumulation and proliferation of the Caco2 \nand SW620 cell lines in a dose dependent manner of glucose concentrations. \nMoreover, a significant positive correlation between glucose uptake and ANRIL \nexpression was shown.\nCONCLUSIONS: A high-glucose environment can increase the tumor-promoting effect \nof ANRIL. ANRIL can promote glucose metabolism and colon cancer proliferation by \ndownregulating miR-186-5p with subsequent upregulation of glycolysis enzymes \nexpression and inhibition of apoptosis.\n\nDOI: 10.31557/APJCP.2024.25.4.1371\nPMCID: PMC11162718\nPMID: 38679999 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: None."

Through analysis of Differential Expression Genes (DEGs), Gene Set \nVariation Analysis (GSVA) and Weighted Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA), we \nidentified co-expressed genes between obesity and PTC, and their pathways were \nmainly enriched in the regulation of B-cells. Furthermore, through TCGA-THCA \n(thyroid carcinoma) cohorts analysis, we identified B-cell regulatory-related \ngenes LEF1, TNFRSF13C, SHLD2 and SHLD3 as independent prognostic markers of PTC. \nNext, we explored the transcriptional regulation mechanism of the increased risk \nof PTC in obesity through analysis of DNA methylation CpGs data and single-cell \nRNA sequences (scRNA-seq) from GEO database. PTC-induced hypomethylation of the \npromoter region may be involved in the transcriptional regulation of these \ngenes, while these genes were further identified in naive and regulatory B-cells \nof both diseases. Notably, both of the gene expressions in naive and regulatory \nB-cells showed high similarity in both diseases.

We hypothesize that advanced biological aging \ncontributes to cancer-related morbidity and mortality for PWH and cancer. We \nsought to determine the impact of clonal hematopoiesis (CH) on cancer \ndisparities in PWH.\nMETHODS: We conducted a retrospective study to compare the prevalence and \nclinical outcomes of CH in PWH and people without HIV (PWoH) and cancer. \nIncluded in the study were PWH and similar PWoH based on tumor site, age, tumor \nsequence, and cancer treatment status. Biological aging was also measured using \nepigenetic methylation clocks.\nRESULTS: In 136 patients with cancer, PWH had twice the prevalence of CH \ncompared to similar PWoH (23% vs 11%, P = .07). After adjusting for patient \ncharacteristics, PWH were 4 times more likely than PWoH to have CH (odds ratio, \n4.1 [95% confidence interval, 1.3-13.9]; P = .02). The effect of CH on survival \nwas most pronounced in PWH, who had a 5-year survival rate of 38% if they had CH \n(vs 59% if no CH), compared to PWoH who had a 5-year survival rate of 75% if \nthey had CH (vs 83% if no CH).\nCONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first evidence that PWH may have a higher \nprevalence of CH than PWoH with the same cancers. CH may be an independent \nbiological aging risk factor contributing to inferior survival for PWH and \ncancer.\n\n© The Author(s) 2024.

Here, we describe a nanomedicine with dual responsiveness to pH and \nenzyme for a programmed activation of antitumor immune through the lymphatic \nsystem. The proposed nanomedicine can release the STING agonist diABZI-C2-NH2 in \nthe LNs' acidic environment to activate dendritic cells (DCs) and T cells. Then, \nthe remaining nanomedicine hitchhikes on the activated T cells (PD-1+ T cells) \nthrough binding to PD-1, resulting in an effective delivery into tumor tissues \nowing to the tumor-homing capacity of PD-1+ T cells. The enzyme matrix \nmetalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) being enriched in tumor tissue triggers the release \nof PD-1 antibody (aPD-1) which exerts immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. \nEventually, the nanomedicine delivers a DNA methylation inhibitor GSK-3484862 \n(GSK) into tumor cells, and then the latter combines with granzyme B (GZMB) to \ntrigger tumor cell pyroptosis. Consequently, the pyroptotic tumor cells induce \nrobust immunogenic cell death (ICD) enhancing the DCs maturation and initiating \nthe cascading antitumor immune response. Study on a 4T1 breast tumor mouse model \ndemonstrates the prominent antitumor therapeutic outcome of this nanomedicine \nthrough creating a positive feedback loop of cancer-immunity cycles including \nimmune activation in LNs, T cell-mediated drug delivery, ICB therapy, and tumor \ncell pyroptosis-featured ICD.\n\nDOI: 10.1021/acsnano.3c11464\nPMID: 38639726 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Among the various modifications, sialylation has emerged as a \ndominant subtype implicated in tumor progression, metastasis, immune evasion, \nand chemoresistance. The prognostic significance of sialylation-related \nmolecules has been demonstrated in colorectal cancer. However, the potential \nroles and regulatory mechanisms of sialylation in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) \nhave not been thoroughly investigated. Through Pearson correlation, univariate \nCox hazards proportional regression, and random survival forest model analyses, \nwe identified several prognostic long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) associated with \naberrant sialylation and tumor progression, including LINC00857, LINC00968, \nLINC00663, and ITGA9-AS1. Based on the signatures of four lncRNAs, we classified \npatients into two clusters with different landscapes using a non-negative matrix \nfactorization approach. Collectively, patients in Cluster 1 (C1) exhibited worse \nprognoses than those in Cluster 2 (C2), as well as heavier tumor mutation \nburden. Functional enrichment analysis showed the enrichment of several \npro-tumor pathways in C1, differing from the upregulated Longevity and \nprogrammed cell death pathways in C2. Moreover, we profiled immune infiltration \nlevels of important immune cell lineages in two subgroups using MCPcounter \nscores and single sample gene set enrichment analysis scores, revealing a \nrelatively immunosuppressive microenvironment in C1. Risk analysis indicated \nthat LINC00857 may serve as a pro-tumor regulator, while the other three lncRNAs \nmay be protective contributors. Consistently, we observed upregulated LINC00857 \nin C1, whereas increased expressive levels of LINC00968, LINC00663, and \nITGA9-AS1 were observed in C2. Finally, drug sensitivity analysis suggested that \npatients in the two groups may benefit from different therapeutic strategies, \ncontributing to precise treatment in LUAD. By integrating multi-omics data, we \nidentified four core sialylation-related lncRNAs and successfully established a \nprognostic model to distinguish patients with different characterizations. These \nfindings may provide some insights into the underlying mechanism of sialylation, \nand offer a new stratification way as well as clinical guidance in LUAD.\n\n© 2024.

In Sudan, cases with \ndelayed presentation, particularly those with risk factors such as Toombak \ndipping and alcohol consumption, frequently present with extensive lesions and a \nwide area of Field cancerization which characterized by the presence of genetic \nand epigenetic changes in histologically normal-appearing tissues, and have \nincreased risk for recurrent and second primary tumors. This necessitates more \naggressive treatment and is usually associated with poorer outcomes. The present \nstudy aims to investigate the survival of oral squamous cell carcinoma patients \nwith a wide field of cancerization.\nMETHODS: This prospective longitudinal study includes ninety-three oral cancer \npatients with extensive fields of cancerization who underwent surgical treatment \nat Khartoum Teaching Dental Hospital (KTDH) conducted from 2019 to 2023. These \npatients were regularly assessed for clinical changes such as recurrence, the \ndevelopment of second primary tumours, and overall survival over a period of one \nyear.\nRESULTS: Out of the 93 patients, 57 (61.3%) were males, and 36 (38.7%) were \nfemales. The majority of the patients (82%) had stage IV tumours, and 62.3% had \nnodal metastasis. Twenty-eight (30%) patients developed recurrences, and 14 \n(15%) developed second primary tumours. The overall one-year survival rate was \n89%, and all deceased patients passed away within 12 months. The survival rate \nfor patients with different types of recurrences varied, with patients who had \nregional, local, and locoregional recurrences having survival rates of 87%, 74%, \nand 72%, respectively. Patients who did not experience a recurrence had a \none-year survival rate of 92%. Patients who developed second primary tumours had \nan 86% survival rate. The survival rates for OSCC patients at stages III, IVa, \nand IVb were 90%, 90%, and 71%, respectively.\nCONCLUSION: In this study, 62% of patients had nodal metastasis, 30% developed \nrecurrence, and 15% developed second primary tumours. The overall one-year \nsurvival rate was 89%, although the development of recurrences and second \nprimary tumours had a negative impact on the survival rate.\n\n© 2024.

Polycyclic aromatic \nhydrocarbons (PAHs) are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP)1A and 1B1 to \nDNA-reactive metabolites, which could lead to mutations in critical genes, \neventually resulting in cancer. Omega-3 fatty acids, such as eicosapentaenoic \nacid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are beneficial against cancers. In \nthis investigation, we elucidated the mechanisms by which omega-3 fatty acids \nEPA and DHA will attenuate PAH-DNA adducts and lung carcinogenesis and \ntumorigenesis mediated by the PAHs BP and MC. Adult wild-type (WT) (A/J) mice, \nCyp1a1-null, Cyp1a2-null, or Cyp1b1-null mice were exposed to PAHs \nbenzo[a]pyrene (BP) or 3-methylcholanthrene (MC), and the effects of omega-3 \nfatty acid on PAH-mediated lung carcinogenesis and tumorigenesis were studied. \nThe major findings were as follows: (i) omega-3 fatty acids significantly \ndecreased PAH-DNA adducts in the lungs of each of the genotypes studied; (ii) \ndecreases in PAH-DNA adduct levels by EPA/DHA was in part due to inhibition of \nCYP1B1; (iii) inhibition of soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) enhanced the \nEPA/DHA-mediated prevention of pulmonary carcinogenesis; and (iv) EPA/DHA \nattenuated PAH-mediated carcinogenesis in part by epigenetic mechanisms. Taken \ntogether, our results suggest that omega-3 fatty acids have the potential to be \ndeveloped as cancer chemo-preventive agents in people.\n\nDOI: 10.3390/ijms25073781\nPMCID: PMC11012139\nPMID: 38612589 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare no conflict of interest."

However, a comprehensive study has not yet been undertaken \nexamining the immunological and predictive effects of TUBA1B in a pan-carcinoma \ncontext. Using data from TCGA, GEO, and other databases, we analyzed TUBA1B \nexpression across various carcinoma types using transcriptional profiling, \nprognostic implications, genetic and epigenetic alterations, methylation \npatterns, and immunological significance. To validate our findings, we conducted \nWestern blot analysis to assess TUBA1B protein levels in matched breast cancer \ntissue samples and performed CCK-8 proliferation assay, flow cytometry, \ntranswell invasion, and migration assays to comprehensively examine the \nfunctional impact of TUBA1B on breast cancer cells. Our pan-cancer analysis \nfound TUBA1B upregulation across most tumor types, with varying expression \npatterns in distinct immune and molecular subtypes. High TUBA1B expression was \nan independent risk factor and associated with poor prognoses in several \ncancers, including BRCA, KICH, LGG, LUAD, and MESO. TUBA1B also demonstrates \nmoderate to high diagnostic accuracy in most tumor types. Increased m6A \nmethylation levels were observed in the TUBA1B gene, while its promoter region \ndisplayed low methylation levels. TUBA1B's expression impacted some cancers by \nelevating tumor mutation burden, microsatellite instability, neoantigen \nformation, immune cell infiltration, and the modulation of immune checkpoints. \nFunctional enrichment analysis highlights TUBA1B's involvement in important \ncellular processes such as the cell cycle, p53 signaling, cell senescence, \nprogrammed cell death, and the regulation of immune-related pathways. Moreover, \nour study reveals higher TUBA1B protein expression in breast cancer tissues \ncompared to adjacent tissues. In vitro experiments confirm that TUBA1B deletion \nreduces breast cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and migration while \nincreasing apoptosis. In conclusion, our study suggests that TUBA1B could \npotentially serve as a diagnostic marker for predicting cancer immunological \nprofiles and survival outcomes and shed light on the expression and role of \nTUBA1B in breast cancer, providing a solid foundation for considering it as a \npromising therapeutic target for breast cancer patient treatment.\n\n© 2024.

In particular, \nprostate cancer poses a challenge for ICB therapy due to its immunosuppressive \nfeatures. A ketogenic diet (KD) has been reported to enhance response to ICB \ntherapy in some other cancer models. However, adverse effects associated with \ncontinuous KD were also observed, demanding better mechanistic understanding and \noptimized regimens for using KD as an immunotherapy sensitizer. In this study, \nwe established a series of ICB-resistant prostate cancer cell lines and \ndeveloped a highly effective strategy of combining anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 \nantibodies with histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) vorinostat, a cyclic KD \n(CKD), or dietary supplementation of the ketone body β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), \nwhich is an endogenous HDACi. CKD and BHB supplementation each delayed prostate \ncancer tumor growth as monotherapy, and both BHB and adaptive immunity were \nrequired for the antitumor activity of CKD. Single-cell transcriptomic and \nproteomic profiling revealed that HDACi and ketogenesis enhanced ICB efficacy \nthrough both cancer cell-intrinsic mechanisms, including upregulation of MHC \nclass I molecules, and -extrinsic mechanisms, such as CD8+ T-cell \nchemoattraction, M1/M2 macrophage rebalancing, monocyte differentiation toward \nantigen-presenting cells, and diminished neutrophil infiltration.

The molecular and \ncellular mechanisms contributing to BLCA ITH generation remain elusive. It is \nfound that a TM4SF1-positive cancer subpopulation (TPCS) can generate ITH in \nBLCA, evidenced by integrative single cell atlas analysis. Extensive profiling \nof the epigenome and transcriptome of all stages of BLCA revealed their \nevolutionary trajectories. Distinct ancestor cells gave rise to low-grade \nnoninvasive and high-grade invasive BLCA. Epigenome reprograming led to \ntranscriptional heterogeneity in BLCA. During early oncogenesis, \nepithelial-to-mesenchymal transition generated TPCS. TPCS has stem-cell-like \nproperties and exhibited transcriptional plasticity, priming the development of \ntranscriptionally heterogeneous descendent cell lineages. Moreover, TPCS \nprevalence in tumor is associated with advanced stage cancer and poor prognosis. \nThe results of this study suggested that bladder cancer interacts with its \nenvironment by acquiring a stem cell-like epigenomic landscape, which might \ngenerate ITH without additional genetic diversification.\n\n© 2024 The Authors.

These diseases have complex and multifactorial origins, \ninvolving genetic, epigenetic, environmental and lifestyle factors. While \nGenome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) is widely recognized as a valuable tool for \nidentifying variants associated with complex phenotypes; the multifactorial \nnature of NCDs necessitates a more comprehensive exploration, encompassing not \nonly the genetic but also the epigenetic aspect. For this purpose, we employed a \nbioinformatics-multiomics approach to examine the genetic and epigenetic \ncharacteristics of NCDs (i.e. colorectal cancer, coronary atherosclerosis, \nsquamous cell lung cancer, psoriasis, type 2 diabetes, and multiple sclerosis), \naiming to identify novel biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis. Leveraging GWAS \nsummary statistics, we pinpointed Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) \nindependently associated with each NCD. Subsequently, we identified genes linked \nto cell cycle, inflammation and oxidative stress mechanisms, revealing shared \ngenes across multiple diseases, suggesting common functional pathways. From an \nepigenetic perspective, we identified microRNAs (miRNAs) with regulatory \nfunctions targeting these genes of interest. Our findings underscore critical \ngenetic pathways implicated in these diseases. In colorectal cancer, the \ndysregulation of the \"Cytokine Signaling in Immune System\" pathway, involving \nLAMA5 and SMAD7, regulated by Hsa-miR-21-5p, Hsa-miR-103a-3p, and \nHsa-miR-195-5p, emerged as pivotal. In coronary atherosclerosis, the pathway \nassociated with \"binding of TCF/LEF:CTNNB1 to target gene promoters\" displayed \nnoteworthy implications, with the MYC factor controlled by Hsa-miR-16-5p as a \npotential regulatory factor. Squamous cell lung carcinoma analysis revealed \nsignificant pathways such as \"PTK6 promotes HIF1A stabilization,\" regulated by \nHsa-let-7b-5p. In psoriasis, the \"Endosomal/Vacuolar pathway,\" involving HLA-C \nand Hsa-miR-148a-3p and Hsa-miR-148b-3p, was identified as crucial. Type 2 \nDiabetes implicated the \"Regulation of TP53 Expression\" pathway, controlled by \nHsa-miR-106a-5p and Hsa-miR-106b-5p. In conclusion, our study elucidates the \ngenetic framework and molecular mechanisms underlying NCDs, offering crucial \ninsights into potential genetic/epigenetic biomarkers for diagnosis and \nprognosis. The specificity of pathways and related miRNAs in different \npathologies highlights promising candidates for further clinical validation, \nwith the potential to advance personalized treatments and alleviate the global \nburden of NCDs.\n\nCopyright © 2024 Elsevier Ltd.

A somatic \ndinucleotide mutation in the lncRNA GAS8-AS1 was reported in Chinese papillary \nthyroid cancer. However, GAS8-AS1 dinucleotide alteration and its impact have \nnever been explored in differentiated thyroid cancers and other populations.\nMETHODS: We extracted genomic DNA from 265 DTCs and 97 normal healthy subjects, \nPCR amplified and Sanger sequenced to examine the GAS8-AS1 dinucleotide \nalteration. Calculated genotype/allele frequency to test Hardy-Weinberg \nEquilibrium (HWE) and performed a genetic model of inheritance to determine its \nassociation with DTC risk. Correlated the GAS8-AS1 dinucleotide variant \ndistribution with clinical characteristics to find the association. Predicted \nGAS8-AS1 RNA secondary structure for wild type and variant using RemuRNA and \nRNAfold to assess the conformational changes.\nRESULTS: GAS8-AS1 dinucleotide alteration (n.713A > G, rs55742939; n.714T > C, \nrs61118444) identified in DTCs is a germline variant not somatic. The GAS8-AS1 \ngenotype and allele frequency significantly deviated for HWE in DTCs \n(χ2 = 37.954; p = 0.0001) though not associated with its risk. Dinucleotide \nvariant distribution was remarkably associated with early-stage disease \n(p = 0.002), lymph node (p = 0.01), and distant metastasis (p = 0.01) in DTCs. \nThe GAS8-AS1 bearing dinucleotide variant markedly showed conformational change \ncompared to that of its wild type.\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that GAS8-AS1 is genetically deregulated \nand implicated in several stages of DTC tumorigenesis suggesting it could be a \npromising prognostic biomarker in DTCs.\n\n© 2024.

This study aimed to investigate the clinicopathological \ncharacteristics and prognostic value of m5C regulators in bladder cancer (BLCA), \nand their correlation with the tumor immune microenvironment.\nMETHODS: Thirteen m5C RNA methylation regulators were analyzed using \nRNA-sequencing and corresponding clinical information obtained from the TCGA \ndatabase. The Cluster Profiler package was used to analyze the gene ontology \nfunction of potential targets and enriched the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and \nGenomes pathway. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to compare survival \ndifferences using the log-rank test and univariate Cox proportional hazards \nregression. The correlation between signature prognostic m5C regulators and \nvarious immune cells was analyzed. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression \nanalyses identified independence of the ALYREF gene signature.\nRESULTS: Nine out of the 13 m5C RNA methylation regulators were differentially \nexpressed in BLCA and normal samples and were co-expressed. These 9 regulators \nwere associated with clinicopathological tumor characteristics, particularly \nhigh or low tumor risk, pT or pTNM stage, and migration. Consensus clustering \nanalysis divides the BLCA samples into 4 clusters. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes \nand Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment annotation and gene ontology function \nanalysis identified 273 upregulated and 594 downregulated genes in BLCA. \nNotably, only ALYREF was significantly correlated with OS (P < .05). ALYREF \nexhibited significant infiltration levels in macrophage cells. Therefore, we \nconstructed a nomogram for ALYREF as an independent prognostic factor. \nAdditionally, we observed that both the mRNA and protein levels of ALYREF were \nupregulated, and immunofluorescence showed that ALYREF was mainly distributed in \nnuclear speckles. ALYREF overexpression was significantly associated with poor \nOS.\nCONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrated the potential of ALYREF to predict \nclinical prognostic risks in BLCA patients and regulate the tumor immune \nmicroenvironment. As such, ALYREF may serve as a novel prognostic indicator in \nBLCA patients.\n\nCopyright © 2024 the Author(s).

Therefore, \nthere is an urgent need to identify highly sensitive, specific, and noninvasive \nbiomarkers for the early detection of this neoplasm. Hypermethylated \nTWIST1/Vimentin promoter may be a noninvasive biomarker using urine sample. We \nassessed the TWIST1/Vimentin promoter methylation status in urine samples using \nthe Methylated Human TWIST1 and Vimentin Gene Detection Kit (Jiangsu MicroDiag \nBiomedicine Co., Ltd., China). The samples were collected from five groups: \ngroup 1 consisted of patients with BUC, group 2 contained other patients with \nurologic tumors, group 3 consisted of patients with benign diseases (e.g., \nurinary tract infections, lithiasis, and benign prostatic hyperplasia), Group 4 \nincluded UTUC (upper tract urothelial carcinoma) patients and group5 comprised \nhealthy individuals. The study encompassed 77 BUC patients, and we evaluated the \ndegree of methylation of the TWIST1/Vimentin gene in their urine samples. \nNotably, TWIST1/Vimentin positivity was significantly elevated in comparison to \ngroups 2, 3 and 5 (all p < 0.001) at a rate of 77.9%, but no significant \ndifference was observed when compared to group 4. In the relationship between \nTWIST1/Vimentin methylation and clinicopathological features of BC patients from \nour center, we found there was no significant association between \nTWIST1/Vimentin status and proteinuria and/or hematuria, and hypermethylation of \nTWIST1 / VIM genes was found in both high and low tumor grade and in both \nnon-muscle invasive bladder cancer (stages Tis, Ta, or T1) and muscle-invasive \nbladder cancer (stage T2 or above). In the multivariable analysis for cancer \ndetection, a positive TWIST1/Vimentin methylation were significantly linked to a \nheightened risk of BC. Moreover, TWIST1/Vimentin promoter methylation \ndemonstrated an ability to detect BUC in urine samples with a sensitivity of 78% \nand a specificity of 83%. Our findings reveal that hypermethylation of the \nTWIST1/Vimentin promoter occurs in bladder urothelial carcinoma, and its high \nsensitivity and specificity suggest its potential as a screening and therapeutic \nbiomarker for urothelial carcinoma of the bladder.\n\n© 2024.

Herein, a novel ratiometric \nfluorescence method based on the methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme \n(MSRE), CRISPR/Cas12a, and catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) amplification were \ndeveloped to detect site-specific methylation with high sensitivity and \nspecificity. In detail, AciI, one of the commonly used MSREs, was employed to \ndistinguish the methylated target from nonmethylated targets. The CRISPR/Cas12a \nsystem was utilized to recognize the site-specific target. In this process, the \nprotospacer adjacent motif and crRNA-dependent identification, the single-base \nresolution of Cas12a, can effectively ensure detection specificity. The \ntrans-cleavage ability of Cas12a can convert one target into abundant activators \nand can then trigger the CHA reaction, leading to the accomplishment of cascaded \nsignal amplification. Moreover, with the structural change of the hairpin probe \nduring CHA, two labeled dyes can be spatially separated, generating a change of \nthe Förster resonance energy transfer signal. In general, the proposed strategy \nof tandem CHA after the CRISPR/Cas12a reaction not only avoids the generation of \nfalse-positive signals caused by the target-similar nucleic acid but can also \nimprove the sensitivity. The use of ratiometric fluorescence can eradicate \nenvironmental effects by self-calibration. Consequently, the proposed approach \nhad a detection limit of 2.02 fM. This approach could distinguish between \ncolorectal cancer and precancerous tissue, as well as between colorectal \npatients and healthy people. Therefore, the developed method can serve as an \nexcellent site-specific methylation detection tool, which is promising for \nbiological and disease studies.\n\nDOI: 10.1021/acssensors.3c02571\nPMID: 38573977 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

We aimed to investigate the potential of smoking-related white \nblood cell (WBC) methylation markers to contribute to an increase in bladder \ncancer risk prediction over classical questionnaire-based smoking metrics (i.e., \nduration, intensity, packyears) in a nested case-control study within the \nprospective prostate, lung, colorectal, and ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening \nTrial and the alpha-tocopherol, beta-carotene cancer (ATBC) Prevention Study \n(789 cases; 849 controls). We identified 200 differentially methylated sites \nassociated with smoking status and 28 significantly associated (after correction \nfor multiple testing) with bladder cancer risk among 2670 previously reported \nsmoking-related cytosine-phosphate-guanines sites (CpGs). Similar patterns were \nobserved across cohorts. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses \nindicated that cg05575921 (AHHR), the strongest smoking-related association we \nidentified for bladder cancer risk, alone yielded similar predictive performance \n(AUC: 0.60) than classical smoking metrics (AUC: 0.59-0.62). Best prediction was \nachieved by including the first principal component (PC1) from the 200 \nsmoking-related CpGs alongside smoking metrics (AUC: 0.63-0.65).

Lower grade glioma (LGG), as a malignant tumor, is accompanied by \nabnormalities in mitosis, but there have been no reports of REEP4 so far.\nMETHODS: We collected transcriptome data, DNA methylation data and the clinical \ncharacteristics of thousands of patients with LGG. Various big data analysis \nmethods and molecular biology experiments were employed to reveal the impact of \nREEP4 on the pathological process of LGG.\nRESULTS: It was found that the expression of REEP4 was significantly elevated \nand negatively regulated by its methylation site. Therefore, both the high \nexpression of REEP4 and low methylation state of cg16311504 showed that the \npatients are correlated with lower patient survival rate. In addition, high \nREEP4 expression participates in the regulation of various cancer-related \ncellular signaling pathways, such as the cell cycle, MAPK signaling pathway, \nNOD-like receptor signaling pathway, etc. More importantly, the level of immune \ncell infiltration significantly increased in the high expression group of REEP4 \nin the LGG tumor microenvironment and REEP4 has a high positive correlation with \nPD-L1 and other immune checkpoints.\nCONCLUSIONS: In brief, this study is the first to introduce REEP4 in malignant \ntumors, which can be used as an independent risk factor that participates in the \nmalignant process of LGG. More importantly, REEP4 has the potential to become a \nnew star in the field of anti-tumor treatment.\n\nDOI: 10.18632/aging.205695\nPMCID: PMC11042925\nPMID: 38552216 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: CONFLICTS OF INTEREST: The authors declare no \nconflicts of interest related to this study."

Addressing these challenges, this study utilized multi-omics \ndata to define consensus molecular subtypes in CRC and elucidate their \nassociation with clinical outcomes and underlying biological processes.\nMETHODS: Consensus molecular subtypes were obtained by applying ten integrated \nmulti-omics clustering algorithms to analyze TCGA-CRC multi-omics data, \nincluding mRNA, lncRNA, miRNA, DNA methylation CpG sites, and somatic mutation \ndata. The association of subtypes with prognoses, enrichment functions, immune \nstatus, and genomic alterations were further analyzed. Next, we conducted \nunivariate Cox and Lasso regression analyses to investigate the potential \nprognostic application of biomarkers associated with multi-omics subtypes \nderived from weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). The function \nof one of the biomarkers MID2 was validated in CRC cell lines.\nRESULTS: Two CRC subtypes linked to distinct clinical outcomes were identified \nin TCGA-CRC cohort and validated with three external datasets. The CS1 subtype \nexhibited a poor prognosis and was characterized by higher tumor-related \nHallmark pathway activity and lower metabolism pathway activity. In addition, \nthe CS1 was predicted to have less immunotherapy responder and exhibited more \ngenomic alteration compared to CS2. Then a prognostic model comprising five \ngenes was established, with patients in the high-risk group showing substantial \nconcordance with the CS1 subtype, and those in the low-risk group with the CS2 \nsubtype. The gene MID2, included in the prognostic model, was found to be \ncorrelated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway and distinct DNA \nmethylation patterns. Knockdown of MID2 in CRC cells resulted in reduced colony \nformation, migration, and invasion capacities.\nCONCLUSION: The integrative multi-omics subtypes proposed potential biomarkers \nfor CRC and provided valuable knowledge for precision oncology.\n\n© 2024.

To address this \nchallenge, we employed a supervised machine learning technique, specifically \nrandom survival forests, to predict the risk of relapse and mortality using \narray-based DNA methylation data from a cohort of 763 pediatric ALL patients \ntreated in Nordic countries. The relapse risk predictor (RRP) was constructed \nbased on 16 CpG sites, demonstrating c-indexes of 0.667 and 0.677 in the \ntraining and test sets, respectively. The mortality risk predictor (MRP), \ncomprising 53 CpG sites, exhibited c-indexes of 0.751 and 0.754 in the training \nand test sets, respectively. To validate the prognostic value of the predictors, \nwe further analyzed two independent cohorts of Canadian (n = 42) and Nordic \n(n = 384) ALL patients. The external validation confirmed our findings, with the \nRRP achieving a c-index of 0.667 in the Canadian cohort, and the RRP and MRP \nachieving c-indexes of 0.529 and 0.621, respectively, in an independent Nordic \ncohort. The precision of the RRP and MRP models improved when incorporating \ntraditional risk group data, underscoring the potential for synergistic \nintegration of clinical prognostic factors. The MRP model also enabled the \ndefinition of a risk group with high rates of relapse and mortality. Our results \ndemonstrate the potential of DNA methylation as a prognostic factor and a tool \nto refine risk stratification in pediatric ALL. This may lead to personalized \ntreatment strategies based on epigenetic profiling.\n\n© 2024.

Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research \nInstitute, Tampa, FL. Electronic address: rami.komrokji@moffitt.org.\n\nBACKGROUND: Myelofibrosis is the most aggressive subtype among classical \nBCR::ABL1 negative myeloproliferative neoplasms. About 90% of cases are driven \nby constitutive activation of 1 of 3 genes impacting the JAK/STAT pathway: JAK2, \nCALR, and MPL. Triple-negative myelofibrosis (TN-MF) accounts for only 5%-10% of \ncases and carries the worst outcomes. Little has been described about this \nsubset of disease. Given the marked heterogeneity surrounding disease biology, \nclonal architecture, clinical presentation, and poor outcomes in TN-MF, \nidentification of features of interest and assessment of treatment response are \nareas in need of further investigation.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: We collected and evaluated baseline clinical and molecular \nparameters from 626 patients with a diagnosis of myelofibrosis who presented to \nthe H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa (Florida, US) between 2003 and 2021 \nand compared them based on presence or absence of the three classical phenotypic \ndriver mutations.\nRESULTS: A small proportion of patients (6%) harbored TN-MF which correlated \nwith inferior outcomes, marked by a 4-year reduction in overall survival time \ncompared to the non-TN cohort (mOS 37.4 months vs. 85.7 months; P = .009) and \nhigher rates of leukemic transformation. More pronounced thrombocytopenia and \nanemia, lower LDH, EPO levels, as well as lower percentage of marrow blasts at \nbaseline were more commonly seen in TN-MF (P < .05). Similarly, patients with \nTN-MF had higher risk disease per DIPSS+ and GIPSS. Mutations impacting RNA \nsplicing, epigenetic modification and signaling, specifically SRSF2, SETBP1, \nIDH2, CBL, and GNAS, were more commonly seen among those lacking a classical \nphenotypic driver. The prevalence of co-mutant ASXL1/SRSF2 clones was \nsignificantly higher in TN-MF as was trisomy 8. TN patients had fewer responses \n(46.2% vs. 63.4%) and shorter duration of response to ruxolitinib.\nCONCLUSION: TN-MF is invariably associated with significantly decreased survival \nand more aggressive clinical behavior with higher rates of leukemic \ntransformation and shorter duration of response to ruxolitinib. Mutations \nimpacting RNA splicing, epigenetic modification and signaling (SRSF2, SETBP1, \nIDH2, CBL, and GNAS) are more common in TN-MF, which likely drive its aggressive \ncourse and may account for suboptimal responses to JAK inhibition.\n\nCopyright © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

Box 3354, Riyadh 11211, Saudi \nArabia.\n\nBreast cancer (BC) and ovarian cancer (OC) are rapidly increasing in Saudi \nArabia. BRCA1 and MGMT epimutations have been linked to a higher risk of these \nmalignancies. The present research investigated the impact of these epimutations \non the prevalence of BC and OC among Saudi women. DNA methylation was evaluated \nusing methylation-specific PCR, whereas mRNA expression levels were assessed \nusing qRT-PCR. We evaluated white blood cell (WBC)-BRCA1 methylation in 1958 \nSaudi women (908 BC patients, 223 OC patients, and 827 controls). MGMT \nmethylation was determined in 1534 of the 1958 women (700 BC patients, 223 OC \npatients, and 611 controls). BRCA1 methylation was detected in 8.6% of the \ncontrols and 11% of the BC patients. This epimutation was linked to 13.8% of the \nearly-onset BC patients (p = 0.003) and 20% of the triple-negative breast cancer \n(TNBC) patients (p = 0.0001). BRCA1 methylation was also detected in 14% of the \nOC patients (p = 0.011), 19.4% of patients aged <55 years (p = 0.0007), and \n23.4% of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) patients. In contrast, the \nBRCA1 mutation was detected in 24% of the OC patients, 27.4% of patients aged \n≥55 years, and 26.7% of the HGSOC patients. However, MGMT methylation was \ndetected in 10% of the controls and 17.4% of the BC patients (p = 0.0003). This \nepimutation was linked to 26.4% of the late-onset BC patients (p = 0.0001) and \n11% of the TNBC patients. MGMT methylation was also found in 15.2% of the OC \npatients (p = 0.034) and 19.1% of HGSOC patients (p = 0.054). Furthermore, 36% \nof the BRCA1-methylated patients and 34.5% of the MGMT-methylated patients had a \nfamily history of cancer, including breast and ovarian cancer. Notably, BRCA1 \nand MGMT mRNA levels were greater in the WBC RNA of the BC patients and \ncancer-free methylation carriers than in that of the OC patients. Our data \nindicate that BRCA1 and MGMT epimutations significantly contribute to the \ndevelopment of breast cancer and ovarian cancer in Saudi cancer patients. These \nblood-based biomarkers could help identify female patients at high risk of \ndeveloping TNBC and HGSOC at an early age.\n\nDOI: 10.3390/ijms25063108\nPMCID: PMC10970267\nPMID: 38542081 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare no conflicts of interest."

Our investigation aimed \nto assess the efficacy of the diagnosis and triage of the PAX1/SOX1 methylation \npanel in detecting CIN or CA.\nMETHODS: A total of 461 patients with abnormal high-risk human papillomavirus \n(hrHPV) or cytology test results were recruited for this study. Each patient \nunderwent an assortment of assessments, comprising a cytology test, hrHPV test, \ncolposcopy examination, and PAX1 and SOX1 methylation tests.\nRESULTS: The extent of methylation of both genes demonstrates a positive \ncorrelation with the severity of CIN lesions and CA. To determine the \ncorrelation for patients with CIN2 or worse (CIN2+), the area under curve was \n0.821 (95% CI: 0.782-0.853) for PAX1 and 0.800 (95% CI: 0.766-0.838) for SOX1, \nwhile for CIN3 or worse (CIN3+), 0.881 (95% CI: 0.839-0.908) for PAX1 and 0.867 \n(95% CI: 0.830-0.901) for SOX1. The PAX1/SOX1 methylation marker panel performed \nsensitivity and specificity of 77.16% and 91.67% for CIN2+, 84.76% and 90.50% \nfor CIN3+, respectively. Regarding triaging hrHPV+ patients, the PAX1/SOX1 \nmethylation test only referred 11.83% of the patients who are unnecessary for \ncolonoscopy examination, which is comparatively lower than cytology, thereby \nsignifying a promising triage strategy for hrHPV-positive women. Furthermore, we \nobserved that the positive PAX1/SOX1 methylation test result for untreated CIN1 \nor fewer patients would result in a higher likelihood of progression upon a \n24-month follow-up visit.\nCONCLUSION: The present investigation demonstrates that the PAX1/SOX1 \nmethylation marker panel exhibits favorable diagnostic performance in CIN \ndetection and holds the potential to be employed for individual CIN tests or \nhrHPV-positive triage.\n\n© 2024 The Author(s).

This study aimed to investigate the potential genes underlying \nthis mechanism. GM Genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary data were from \nthe MiBioGen consortium. PC GWAS data were from the National Human Genome \nResearch Institute-European Bioinformatics Institute (NHGRI-EBI) GWAS Catalogue. \nTo detect the causal relationship between GM and PC, we implemented three \ncomplementary Mendelian randomization (MR) methods: Inverse Variance Weighting \n(IVW), MR-Egger and Weighted Median, followed by sensitivity analyses. \nFurthermore, we integrated GM GWAS data with blood cis-expression quantitative \ntrait loci (eQTLs) and blood cis-DNA methylation QTL (mQTLs) using Summary \ndata-based Mendelian Randomization (SMR) methods. This integration aimed to \nprioritize potential GM-affecting genes through SMR analysis of two molecular \ntraits. PC cis-eQTLs and cis-mQTLs were summarized from The Cancer Genome Atlas \n(TCGA) data. Through colocalization analysis of GM cis-QTLs and PC cis-QTLs \ndata, we identified common genes that influence both GM and PC. Our study found \na causal association between GM and PC, including four protective and five \nrisk-associated GM [Inverse Variance Weighted (IVW), p < 0.05]. No significant \nheterogeneity of instrumental variables (IVs) or horizontal pleiotropy was \nfound. The gene SVBP was identified as a GM-affecting gene using SMR analysis of \ntwo molecular traits (FDR<0.05, P_HEIDI>0.05). Additionally, two genes, MCM6 and \nRPS26, were implicated in the interaction between GM and PC based on \ncolocalization analysis (PPH4>0.5). In summary, this study provides evidence for \nfuture research aimed at developing suitable therapeutic interventions and \ndisease prevention.\n\n© 2024 The Authors.

We evaluated whether DNA methylation \nstatus of selected candidate genes can predict the risk of metastasis beyond \nclinical risk factors in men with untreated PCa. A nested case-control study was \nconducted among men diagnosed with localized PCa at Kaiser Permanente California \nbetween 01/01/1997-12/31/2006 who did not receive curative treatments. Cases \nwere those who developed metastasis within 10 years from diagnosis. Controls \nwere selected using density sampling. Ninety-eight candidate genes were selected \nfrom functional categories of cell cycle control, metastasis/tumour suppressors, \ncell signalling, cell adhesion/motility/invasion, angiogenesis, and immune \nfunction, and 41 from pluripotency genes. Cancer DNA from diagnostic biopsy \nblocks were extracted and analysed. Associations of methylation status were \nassessed using CpG site level and principal components-based analysis in \nconditional logistic regressions. In 215 cases and 404 controls, 27 candidate \ngenes were found to be statistically significant in at least one of the two \nanalytical approaches. The agreement between the methods was 25.9% (7 candidate \ngenes, including 2 pluripotency markers). The DNA methylation status of several \ncandidate genes was significantly associated with risk of metastasis in \nuntreated localized PCa patients. These findings may inform future risk \nprediction models for PCa metastasis beyond clinical characteristics.\n\nDOI: 10.1080/15592294.2024.2308920\nPMCID: PMC10965114\nPMID: 38525786 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare the following financial \ninterests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing \ninterests: Chao CR received research funding from Merck & Co. for research \nprojects unrelated to this work.

This increased risk may result from occupational \nexposures to many toxicants, including per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances \n(PFAS). This study assessed the association between firefighting as an \noccupation in general or PFAS serum levels, with DNA methylation. Only genomic \nregions previously linked to prostate cancer risk were selected for analysis: \nGSTP1, Alu repetitive elements, and the 8q24 chromosomal region. There were 444 \nmale firefighters included in this study, with some analyses being conducted on \nfewer participants due to missingness. Statistical models were used to test \nassociations between exposures and DNA methylation at CpG sites in the selected \ngenomic regions. Exposure variables included proxies of cumulative firefighting \nexposures (incumbent versus academy status and years of firefighting experience) \nand biomarkers of PFAS exposures (serum concentrations of 9 PFAS). Proxies of \ncumulative exposures were associated with DNA methylation at 15 CpG sites and \none region located within FAM83A (q-value <0.1). SbPFOA was associated with 19 \nCpG sites (q < 0.1), but due to low detection rates, this PFAS was modeled as \ndetected versus not detected in serum. Overall, there is evidence that \nfirefighting experience is associated with differential DNA methylation in \nprostate cancer risk loci, but this study did not find evidence that these \ndifferences are due to PFAS exposures specifically.\n\n© 2024 The Authors.

Our study identified a signature of potential prognostic \ngenes associated with ECM and constructed immune risk-related prognosis model in \nLUAD. We downloaded mRNAs transcriptome data, miRNAs expression data, and \nclinical patient information for LUAD based on The Cancer Genome Atlas. \"Limma, \nclusterProfiler, ggplot2\" R packages and GSEA were used to analyze meaningful \ngenes and explore potential biological function. A competing endogenous RNA \nnetwork was constructed to reveal the mechanism of ECM-related genes. Combined \nwith clinical LUAD patients' characteristics, univariate and multivariate Cox \nregression analyses were used to build prognostic immune risk model. Next, we \ncalculated AUC value of ROC curve, and explored survival probability of \ndifferent risk groups. A total of 2966 mRNAs were differently expressed in LUAD \nsamples and normal samples. Function enrichment analyses proved mRNAs were \nassociated with many tumor pathways, such as cell adhesion, vascular smooth \nmuscle contraction, and cell cycle. There were 18 mRNAs related to ECM receptor \nsignaling pathway, and 7 mRNAs expressions were correlated with EGFR expression, \nbut only 5mRNAs were associated with the long-term prognosis. Based on Integrin \nalpha-8 (ITGA8) molecule, we identified potential 3 miRNAs from several \ndatabases. The promoter of ITGA8 was higher-methylated and lower-expressed in \nLUAD. And lower-expressed group has poor prognosis for patients. 66 \nimmunomodulators related to ITGA8 were performed to construct immune correlation \nprediction model (p < 0.05). Comprehensive analyses of ITGA8 revealed it \ncombined focal adhesion kinase to activate PI3K/AKT signaling pathway to \ninfluence the occurrence and development of LUAD. A novel immune prognostic \nmodel about ITGA8 was constructed and verified in LUAD patients. Combined with \nnon-coding genes and genomic epigenetics, identification of potential biomarkers \nprovided new light on therapeutic strategy for clinical patients.\n\n© 2024.

Our aim was to assess the performance of the S5 DNA methylation \nclassifier for predicting incident high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia \n(CIN) and ICC among hrHPV+ women in the ARTISTIC screening trial cohort. The S5 \nclassifier, comprising target regions of tumour suppressor gene EPB41L3 and L1 \nand L2 regions of HPV16, HPV18, HPV31, and HPV33, was assayed by pyrosequencing \nin archived hrHPV+ liquid-based samples from 343 women with high-grade disease \n(139 CIN2, 186 CIN3, and 18 ICC) compared to 800 hrHPV+ controls. S5 DNA \nmethylation correlated directly with increasing severity of disease and \ninversely with lead time to diagnosis. S5 could discriminate between hrHPV+ \nwomen who developed CIN3 or ICC and hrHPV+ controls (p <.0001) using samples \ntaken on average 5 years before diagnosis. This relationship was independent of \ncytology at baseline. The S5 test showed much higher sensitivity than HPV16/18 \ngenotyping for identifying prevalent CIN3 (93% vs. 61%, p = .01) but lower \nspecificity (50% vs. 66%, p <.0001). The S5 classifier identified most women at \nhigh risk of developing precancer and missed very few prevalent advanced lesions \nthus appearing to be an objective test for triage of hrHPV+ women. The \ncombination of methylation of host and HPV genes enables S5 to combine the \npredictive power of methylation with HPV genotyping to identify hrHPV-positive \nwomen who are at highest risk of developing CIN3 and ICC in the future.\n\n© 2024 The Authors.

While electronic cigarettes \n(e-cigarettes) have been advocated as harm reduction alternatives to tobacco \nproducts, recent studies have revealed potential detrimental effects, \nhighlighting the urgent need for further research into the molecular and health \nimpacts of e-cigarettes. Here, we applied computational deconvolution methods to \ndissect the cell- and tissue-specific epigenetic effects of tobacco or \ne-cigarette use on DNA methylation (DNAme) in over 3,500 buccal/saliva, \ncervical, or blood samples, spanning epithelial and immune cells at directly and \nindirectly exposed sites. The 535 identified smoking-related DNAme loci \n[cytosine-phosphate-guanine sites (CpG)] clustered into four functional groups, \nincluding detoxification or growth signaling, based on cell type and anatomic \nsite. Loci hypermethylated in buccal epithelial cells of smokers associated with \nNOTCH1/RUNX3/growth factor receptor signaling also exhibited elevated \nmethylation in cancer tissue and progressing lung carcinoma in situ lesions, and \nhypermethylation of these sites predicted lung cancer development in buccal \nsamples collected from smokers up to 22 years prior to diagnosis, suggesting a \npotential role in driving carcinogenesis. Alarmingly, these CpGs were also \nhypermethylated in e-cigarette users with a limited smoking history.

However, it is unknown whether aberrant DNA methylation, which is \ninduced by atrophic gastritis (AG) and is a risk for gastric cancer, is induced \nby NG. Here, we analyzed methylation induction by NG.\nMETHODS: Gastric mucosal samples were obtained from non-cancerous antral tissues \nof 16 NG and 20 AG patients with gastric cancer and 5 NG and 6 AG patients \nwithout, all age- and gender-matched. Genome-wide methylation analysis and \nexpression analysis were conducted by a BeadChip array and RNA-sequencing, \nrespectively.\nRESULTS: Clustering analysis of non-cancerous antral tissues of NG and AG \npatients with gastric cancer was conducted using methylation levels of 585 \npromoter CpG islands (CGIs) of methylation-resistant genes, and a large fraction \nof NG samples formed a cluster with strong methylation induction. Promoter CGIs \nof CDH1 and DAPK1 tumor-suppressor genes were more methylated in NG than in AG. \nNotably, methylation levels of these genes were also higher in the antrum of NG \npatients without cancer. Genes related to lymphoid follicle formation, such as \nCXCL13/CXCR5 and CXCL12/CXCR4, had higher expression in NG, and genes involved \nin DNA demethylation TET2 and IDH1, had only half the expression in NG.\nCONCLUSIONS: Severe aberrant methylation, involving multiple tumor-suppressor \ngenes, was induced in the gastric antrum and body of patients with NG, in \naccordance with their high gastric cancer risk.\n\n© 2024.

However, the specific \nregulatory mechanisms remain unclear. Using CellAge and The Cancer Genome Atlas \ndatabases and in-house RNA-seq data, DNA methylation-modified cellular \nsenescence genes (DMCSGs) were validated by Support Vector Machine and \ncorrelation analyses. In 1150 cases and 1342 controls, we identified colorectal \ncancer risk variants in DMCSGs. The regulatory effects of gene, variant, and DNA \nmethylation were explored through dual-luciferase and 5-azacytidine treatment \nexperiments, complemented by multiple database analyses. Biological functions of \nkey gene were evaluated via cell proliferation assays, SA-β-gal staining, \nsenescence marker detection, and immune infiltration analyses. The genetic \nvariant rs4558926 in the downstream of TACC3 was significantly associated with \ncolorectal cancer risk (OR = 1.35, P = 3.22 × 10-4). TACC3 mRNA expression \nincreased due to rs4558926 C > G and decreased DNA methylation levels. The CpG \nsites in the TACC3 promoter region were regulated by rs4558926. TACC3 knockdown \ndecreased proliferation and senescence in colorectal cancer cells. In addition, \nsubjects with high-TACC3 expression presented an immunosuppressive \nmicroenvironment. These findings provide insights into the involvement of \ngenetic variants of cellular senescence genes in the development and progression \nof colorectal cancer.\n\n© 2024.

We previously demonstrated that dietary polyphenols, \nspecifically resveratrol (RSV) and other stilbenoids, epigenetically target \noncogenes for silencing via DNA hypermethylation in breast cancer. In the \npresent study, we identify signal transduction regulators among \nRSV-hypermethylated targets and investigate the functional role of RSV-mediated \nDNA hypermethylation in the regulation of Hedgehog and Wnt signaling. \nNon-invasive ER-positive MCF-7 and highly invasive triple-negative MCF10CA1a \nhuman breast cancer cell lines were used as experimental models. Upon 9-day \nexposure to 15 µM RSV, pyrosequencing and qRT-PCR were performed to assess DNA \nmethylation and expression of GLI2 and WNT4, which are upstream regulators of \nthe Hedgehog and Wnt pathways, respectively. Our results showed that RSV led to \na DNA methylation increase within GLI2 and WNT4 enhancers, which was accompanied \nby decreases in gene expression. Consistently, we observed the downregulation of \ngenes downstream of the Hedgehog and Wnt signaling, including common targets \nshared by both pathways, CCND1 and CYR61. Further analysis using chromatin \nimmunoprecipitation identified increased H3K27 trimethylation and decreased H3K9 \nand H3K27 acetylation, along with abolishing OCT1 transcription factor binding. \nThose changes indicate a transcriptionally silent chromatin state at GLI2 and \nWNT4 enhancers. The inhibition of the Wnt signal transduction was confirmed \nusing a phospho-antibody array that demonstrated suppression of positive and \nstimulation of negative Wnt regulators. In conclusion, our results provide \nscientific evidence for dietary polyphenols as epigenetics-modulating agents \nthat act to re-methylate and silence oncogenes, reducing the oncogenic signal \ntransduction. Targeting such an action could be an effective strategy in breast \ncancer prevention and/or adjuvant therapy.\n\nDOI: 10.3390/nu16050699\nPMCID: PMC10934115\nPMID: 38474826 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare no conflicts of interest."

In continuation, the identified genes were \nvalidated by an independent dataset and showed a correlation with nodal and \nmetastatic status. Furthermore, gene ontology and pathway analysis revealed that \nimmune-related pathways are activated in ccRCC patients.\nCONCLUSIONS: The network analysis of six overexpressed genes suggests their \npotential role in an immunosuppressive environment, leading to tumor progression \nand poor prognosis.

Nevertheless, \nthe extracellular signaling cues that modulate the distribution of this central \nchromatin modification are largely unclear. DNA methylation is highly abundant \nat repetitive elements, but its investigation in live cells has been complicated \nby methodological challenges. Utilizing a CRISPR/dCas9 biosensor that reads DNA \nmethylation of human α-satellite repeats in live cells, we here uncover a \nsignaling pathway linking the chromatin and transcriptional state of repetitive \nelements to epithelial adherens junction integrity. Specifically, we find that \nin confluent breast epithelial cell monolayers, α-satellite repeat methylation \nis reduced by comparison to low density cultures. This is coupled with increased \ntranscriptional activity at repeats. Through comprehensive perturbation \nexperiments, we identify the junctional protein E-cadherin, which links to the \nactin cytoskeleton, as a central molecular player for signal relay into the \nnucleus. Furthermore, we find that this pathway is impaired in cancer cells that \nlack E-cadherin and are not contact-inhibited. This suggests that the molecular \nconnection between cell density and repetitive element methylation could play a \nrole in the maintenance of epithelial tissue homeostasis.\n\n© 2024.

Downregulation of the nitric oxide (NO)-cyclic guanosine \nmonophosphate (cGMP) signalling pathway contributes to prostate dysfunctions. \nPrevious studies in cancer cells or vessels have shown that the epigenetic \nmechanisms control the gene and protein expression of the enzymes involved in \nthe production of NO and cGMP. This study is aimed to evaluate the effect of a \n2-week treatment of 5-azacytidine (5-AZA), a DNA-methyltransferase inhibitor, in \nthe prostate function of mice fed with a high-fat diet. Functional, \nhistological, biochemical and molecular assays were carried out.

The relaxation induced by the NO-donor \nand the protein expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and \nsoluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) were significantly decreased in the prostate of \nobese mice. The treatment with 5-AZA reverted the higher expression of α-actin, \nreduced the hypercontractility state of the prostate and increased the \nexpression of eNOS and sGC and intraprostatic levels of cGMP. When prostates \nfrom obese mice treated with 5-AZA were incubated in vitro with inhibitors of \nthe NOS or sGC, the inhibitory effect of 5-AZA was reverted, therefore, showing \nthe involvement of NO and cGMP.

Yet, our understanding of the mechanisms driving CH progression \nto MN and clinical risk prediction of MN remains limited. The human proteome \nreflects complex interactions between genetic and epigenetic regulation of \nbiological systems. We hypothesized that the plasma proteome might predict MN \nrisk and inform our understanding of the mechanisms promoting MN development.\nEXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We jointly characterized CH and plasma proteomic profiles \nof 46,237 individuals in the UK Biobank at baseline study entry. During 500,036 \nperson-years of follow-up, 115 individuals developed MN. Cox proportional hazard \nregression was used to test for an association between plasma protein levels and \nMN risk.\nRESULTS: We identified 115 proteins associated with MN risk, of which 30% (N = \n34) were also associated with CH. These were enriched for known regulators of \nthe innate and adaptive immune system. Plasma proteomics improved the prediction \nof MN risk (AUC = 0.85; P = 5×10-9) beyond clinical factors and CH (AUC = 0.80). \nIn an independent group (N = 381,485), we used inherited polygenic risk scores \n(PRS) for plasma protein levels to validate the relevance of these proteins \ntoMNdevelopment. PRS analyses suggest that most MN-associated proteins we \nidentified are not directly causally linked toMN risk, but rather represent \ndownstream markers of pathways regulating the progression of CH to MN.\nCONCLUSIONS: These data highlight the role of immune cell regulation in the \nprogression of CH to MN and the promise of leveraging multi-omic \ncharacterization of CH to improveMN risk stratification.

However, associations between DNA methylation-based aging \nbiomarkers and HRQOL have not been evaluated.\nMETHODS: DNA methylation was generated with Infinium EPIC BeadChip on \nblood-derived DNA (median for age at blood draw = 34.5 years, range = 18.5-66.6 \nyears), and HRQOL was assessed with age at survey (mean = 32.3 years, range = \n18.4-64.5 years) from 2206 survivors in the St Jude Lifetime Cohort. DNA \nmethylation-based aging biomarkers, including epigenetic age using multiple \nclocks (eg, GrimAge) and others (eg, DNAmB2M: beta-2-microglobulin; DNAmADM: \nadrenomedullin), were derived from the DNAm Age Calculator \n(https://dnamage.genetics.ucla.edu). HRQOL was assessed using the Medical \nOutcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey to capture 8 domains and \nphysical and mental component summaries. General linear models evaluated \nassociations between HRQOL and epigenetic age acceleration (EAA; eg, \nEAA_GrimAge) or other age-adjusted DNA methylation-based biomarkers (eg, \nageadj_DNAmB2M) after adjusting for age at blood draw, sex, cancer treatments, \nand DNA methylation-based surrogate for smoking pack-years. All P values were \n2-sided.\nRESULTS: Worse HRQOL was associated with greater EAA_GrimAge (physical component \nsummaries: β = -0.18 years, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.251 to -0.11 \nyears; P = 1.85 × 10-5; and 4 individual HRQOL domains), followed by \nageadj_DNAmB2M (physical component summaries: β = -0.08 years, 95% CI = -0.124 \nto -0.037 years; P = .003; and 3 individual HRQOL domains) and ageadj_DNAmADM \n(physical component summaries: β = -0.082 years, 95% CI = -0.125 to -0.039 \nyears; P = .002; and 2 HRQOL domains). EAA_Hannum (Hannum clock) was not \nassociated with any HRQOL.\nCONCLUSIONS: Overall and domain-specific measures of HRQOL are associated with \nDNA methylation measures of biological aging. Future longitudinal studies should \ntest biological aging as a potential mechanism underlying the association \nbetween poor HRQOL and increased risk of clinically assessed adverse health \noutcomes.\n\n© The Author(s) 2024.

To dissect how the DNA \nmethylation heterogeneity in gliomas is influenced by the complex cellular \ncomposition of the tumour immune microenvironment, we first compared the DNA \nmethylation profiles of purified human immune cells and bulk glioma tissue, \nstratifying three tumour immune microenvironmental subtypes for GBM and LGG \nsamples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We found that more intermediate \nmethylation sites were enriched in glioma tumour tissues, and used the \nProportion of sites with Intermediate Methylation (PIM) to compare intertumoral \nDNA methylation heterogeneity. A larger PIM score reflected stronger DNA \nmethylation heterogeneity. Enhanced DNA methylation heterogeneity was associated \nwith stronger immune cell infiltration, better survival rates, and slower tumour \nprogression in glioma patients. We then created a Cell-type-associated DNA \nMethylation Heterogeneity Contribution (CMHC) score to explore the impact of \ndifferent immune cell types on heterogeneous CpG site (CpGct) in glioma tissues. \nWe identified eight prognosis-related CpGct to construct a risk score: the \nCell-type-associated DNA Methylation Heterogeneity Risk (CMHR) score. CMHR was \npositively correlated with cytotoxic T-lymphocyte infiltration (CTL), and showed \nbetter predictive performance for IDH status (AUC = 0.96) and glioma \nhistological phenotype (AUC = 0.81). Furthermore, DNA methylation alterations of \neight CpGct might be related to drug treatments of gliomas. In conclusion, we \nindicated that DNA methylation heterogeneity is associated with a complex tumour \nimmune microenvironment, glioma phenotype, and patient's prognosis.\n\nDOI: 10.1080/15592294.2024.2318506\nPMCID: PMC10936651\nPMID: 38439715 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: No potential conflict of interest was reported \nby the author(s)."

Notably, much research has focused on the link between epigenetic \nalterations and lung cancer induced by chemicals, although circRNAs are also \nemerging as relevant contributors to the carcinogenic process of benzo(a)pyrene. \nIn this study, we identified circ_0067716 as being significantly upregulated in \nresponse to stress injury and downregulated during malignant transformation \ninduced by benzo(a)pyrene-7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide (BPDE) in human bronchial \nepithelial cells. The observed differential expression of circ_0067716 in cells \ntreated with BPDE for varying durations suggests a strong correlation between \nthis circRNA and BPDE exposure. The tissue samples of lung cancer patients also \nsuggest that a lower circ_0067716 expression is associated with BPDE-DNA adduct \nlevels. Remarkably, we demonstrate that EIF4A3, located in the nucleus, \ninteracts with the flanking sequences of circ_0067716 and inhibits its \nbiogenesis. Conversely, circ_0067716 is capable of sequestering EIF4A3 in the \ncytoplasm, thereby preventing its translocation into the nucleus. EIF4A3 and \ncirc_0067716 can form a double-negative feedback loop that could be affected by \nBPDE. During the initial phase of BPDE exposure, the expression of circ_0067716 \nwas increased in response to stress injury, resulting in cell apoptosis through \nthe involvement of miR-324-5p/DRAM1/BAX axis. Subsequently, as cellular \nadaptation progressed, long-term induction due to BPDE exposure led to an \nelevated EIF4A3 and a reduced circ_0067716 expression, which facilitated the \nproliferation of cells by stabilizing the PI3K/AKT pathway. Thus, our current \nstudy describes the effects of circ_0067716 on the genotoxicity and \ncarcinogenesis induced by benzo(a)pyrene and puts forwards to the possible \nregulatory mechanism on the occurrence of smoking-related lung cancer, providing \na unique insight based on epigenetics.\n\nCopyright © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

This aggressiveness is a consequence of the activation of \nepithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) caused by many different inducers or \nregulators, signaling cascades, epigenetic regulation, and the tumor \nenvironment. Alterations in EMT-related genes and transcription factors are \nassociated with poor prognosis in ccRCC. EMT-related factors suppress E-cadherin \nexpression and are associated with tumor progression, local invasion, and \nmetastasis. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression levels and \nprognostic significance of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), \nβ-catenin, and E-cadherin in ccRCC patients. We examined these proteins \nimmunohistochemically in tumor areas and adjacent normal tissues resected from \npatients with ccRCC. Analysis of the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) cohort was \nperformed to verify our results. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that median \noverall survival (OS) was significantly shorter in patients with tumors \nexhibiting high MIFn and MIFm-c levels compared to those with low MIFn and \nMIFm-c levels (p = 0.03 and p = 0.007, respectively). In the TCGA cohort, there \nwas a significant correlation between MIF expression and OS (p < 0.0001). In \nconclusion, this study provides further evidence for the biological and \nprognostic value of MIF in the context of EMT as a potential early prognostic \nmarker for advanced-stage ccRCC.\n\n© 2024 The Authors.

We previously reported that the CpG island of SMOC1 is frequently \nmethylated in traditional serrated adenomas (TSAs) and colorectal cancers (CRCs) \nbut is rarely methylated in sessile serrated lesions (SSLs). In the present \nstudy, we aimed to further characterize the expression of SMOC1 in early \ncolorectal lesions.\nMETHODS: SMOC1 expression was analyzed immunohistochemically in a series of \ncolorectal tumors (n = 199) and adjacent normal colonic tissues (n = 112).\nRESULTS: SMOC1 was abundantly expressed in normal colon and SSLs while it was \nsignificantly downregulated in TSAs, advanced adenomas and cancers. Mean \nimmunohistochemistry scores were as follows: normal colon, 24.2; hyperplastic \npolyp (HP), 18.9; SSL, 23.8; SSL with dysplasia (SSLD)/SSL with early invasive \ncancer (EIC), 15.8; TSA, 5.4; TSA with high grade dysplasia (HGD)/EIC, 4.7; \nnon-advanced adenoma, 21.4; advanced adenoma, 11.9; EIC, 10.9. Higher levels \nSMOC1 expression correlated positively with proximal colon locations and flat \ntumoral morphology, reflecting its abundant expression in SSLs. Among TSAs that \ncontained both flat and protruding components, levels of SMOC1 expression were \nsignificantly lower in the protruding components.\nCONCLUSION: Our results suggest that reduced expression of SMOC1 is associated \nwith progression of TSAs and conventional adenomas and that SMOC1 expression may \nbe a biomarker for diagnosis of serrated lesions and risk prediction in \ncolorectal tumors.\n\n© 2024.

Histone modifications regulate several biological processes that \nare fundamental to the development of cancer. Lysine methyltransferase 5C \n(KMT5C; also known as SUV420H2) is an epigenetic modifier responsible for the \ntrimethylation of H4K20, which drives critical cellular events, including genome \nintegrity, cell growth and epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT), in various \ntypes of cancer. However, the role of KMT5C in ccRCC remains unclear. As such, \nthe expression and function of KMT5C in ccRCC were investigated in the present \nstudy. KMT5C expression was significantly increased in ccRCC tissues compared \nwith normal tissues (P<0.0001), and it was closely associated with the overall \nsurvival rate of patients with ccRCC. By establishing ccRCC cell lines with \nKMT5C expression knockdown, the role of KMT5C in the maintenance of aerobic \nglycolysis in ccRCC cells via the regulation of several vital glycolytic genes \nwas identified. Additionally, KMT5C promoted the proliferation and EMT of ccRCC \ncells by controlling crucial EMT transcriptional factors. Together, these data \nsuggested that KMT5C may act as an oncoprotein, guide molecular diagnosis, and \nshed light on novel drug development and therapeutic strategies for patients \nwith ccRCC.\n\nDOI: 10.3892/ijo.2024.5633\nPMCID: PMC10919755\nPMID: 38426605 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that they have no competing \ninterests."

Neural Network, \nRandom Forest, and extreme gradient boosting machine learning models were \ntrained to distinguish between tumor types. Methylation data of 29 nonpancreatic \nneoplasms (n = 3708) were used to develop an algorithm capable of detecting \nneoplasms of non-pancreatic origin.\nRESULTS: After benchmarking 3 state-of-the-art machine learning models, the \nrandom forest model emerged as the best classifier with 96.9% accuracy. All \nclassifications received a probability score reflecting the confidence of the \nprediction. Increasing the score threshold improved the random forest classifier \nperformance up to 100% with 87% of samples with scores surpassing the cutoff. \nUsing a logistic regression model, detection of nonpancreatic neoplasms achieved \nan area under the curve of >0.99. Analysis of biopsy specimens showed concordant \nclassification with their paired resection sample.\nCONCLUSIONS: Pancreatic neoplasms can be classified with high accuracy based on \nDNA methylation signatures. Additionally, non-pancreatic neoplasms are \nidentified with near perfect precision. In summary, methylation profiling can \nserve as a valuable adjunct in the diagnosis of pancreatic neoplasms with \nminimal risk for misdiagnosis, even in the pre-operative setting.\n\nCopyright © 2024 The Author(s).

Genetically modified mouse \nmodels and human tumor samples have revealed that p53 loss results in extensive \nchromosomal abnormalities, from copy number alterations to structural \nrearrangements. In this perspective article we explore the multifaceted \nrelationship between p53, genomic stability, and epigenetic control, \nhighlighting its significance in cancer biology. p53 emerges as a critical \nregulator of DNA repair mechanisms, influencing key components of repair \npathways and directly participating in DNA repair processes. p53 role in genomic \nintegrity however extends beyond its canonical functions. p53 influences also \nepigenetic landscape, where it modulates DNA methylation and histone \nmodifications. This epigenetic control impacts the expression of genes involved \nin tumor suppression and oncogenesis. Notably, p53 ability to ensure cellular \nresponse to DNA demethylation contributes to the maintenance of genomic \nstability by preventing unscheduled transcription of repetitive non-coding \ngenomic regions. This latter indicates a causative relationship between the \ncontrol of epigenetic stability and the maintenance of genomic integrity in \np53-mediated tumor suppression. Understanding these mechanisms offers promising \navenues for innovative therapeutic strategies targeting epigenetic dysregulation \nin cancer and emphasizes the need for further research to unravel the \ncomplexities of this relationship. Ultimately, these insights hold the potential \nto transform cancer treatment and prevention strategies.\n\n© 2024.

Psychosocial stress is associated with fibroid risk and severity. The \nrelationship between psychosocial stress and fibroid pathogenesis may involve \nalterations in microRNAs (miRNAs) although this has yet to be examined. We \ninvestigated associations between two psychosocial stress measures, a composite \nmeasure of recent stressful life events and perceived social status, with \nexpression levels of 401 miRNAs in myometrium (n = 20) and fibroids (n = 44; 20 \nwith paired fibroid and myometrium samples) among pre-menopausal women who \nunderwent surgery for fibroid treatment. We used linear regressions to identify \npsychosocial stressors associated with miRNAs, adjusting for covariates (age, \nbody mass index, race/ethnicity, and oral contraceptive use). The association \nbetween psychosocial stressors and miRNAs was considered statistically \nsignificant at an FDR p < 0.10 and showed a monotonic response (nominal \np-trend < 0.05). In the myometrium, 21 miRNAs were significantly associated with \na composite measure of recent stressful events, and two miRNAs were associated \nwith perceived social status. No fibroid miRNAs were associated with either \nstress measure. Pathway analyses revealed miRNA-mRNA targets were significantly \nenriched (FDR p < 0.05) in pathways relevant to cancer/tumor development. Of the \n74 differentially expressed miRNAs between myometrium and fibroids, miR-27a-5p \nand miR-301b were also associated with stress exposure. Our pilot analysis \nsuggests that psychosocial stress is associated with myometrial miRNA expression \nand, thus, may have a role in the pathogenesis of fibroids from healthy \nmyometrium.\n\n© 2024.

Exploring the potential anoikis mechanisms and pathways might facilitate \nGC research.\nPURPOSE: The authors aim to determine the significance of anoikis-related genes \n(ARGs) in GC prognosis and explore the regulatory mechanisms in epigenetics.\nMETHODS: After describing the genetic and transcriptional alterations of ARGs, \nwe searched differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from the cancer genome \natlas and gene expression omnibus databases to identify major cancer marker \npathways. The non-negative matrix factorisation algorithm, Lasso, and Cox \nregression analysis were used to construct a risk model, and we validated and \nassessed the nomogram. Based on multiple levels and online platforms, this \nresearch evaluated the regulatory relationship of ARGs with GC.\nRESULTS: Overexpression of ARGs is associated with poor prognosis, which \nmodulates immune signalling and promotes anti-anoikis. The consistency of the \nDEGs clustering with weighted gene co-expression network analysis results and \nthe nomogram containing 10 variable genes improved the clinical applicability of \nARGs. In anti-anoikis mode, cytology, histology, and epigenetics could \nfacilitate the analysis of immunophenotypes, tumour immune microenvironment \n(TIME), and treatment prognosis.\nCONCLUSION: A novel anoikis-related prognostic model for GC is constructed, and \nthe significance of anoikis-related prognostic genes in the TIME and the \nmetabolic pathways of tumours is initially explored.\n\n© 2024 The Authors.

Although Sorafenib is the standard systemic therapy for \ntreating HCC, but it develops resistance very quickly, leading to poor \nprognosis. The current study was planned to explore the effect of l-methionine \non the anticancer activity of Sorafenib in HCC. Ten millimolar of l-methionine \ntreatment significantly reduced the IC50 of Sorafenib from \n5.513 ± 0.171 to 0.8095 ± 0.0465 µM in HepG2 cell line. It also resulted in \nconcomitant increase in oxidative stress and deactivation of ERK/AMPK/AKT \npathway. Additionally, it also resulted in the increased expression of dual \nspecificity phosphatase 3 (DUSP3). In a rat model of sorafenib-resistant HCC \ninduced by diethylnitrosamine (DEN) (100 mg/L/day) and Sorafenib \n(10 mg/kg), l-methionine (300 and 500 mg/kg/day) supplementation overcame the \ndrug resistance, as indicated by the reduced formation of surface tumor \nnodules, prevention of cellular hypertrophy, hyperplasia and inflammation, and \nimproved animal survival. Furthermore, l-methionine in combination with \nSorafenib also inhibited AMPK/AKT and ERK pathway. At chromatin \nlevel, l-methionine supplementation prevented global methylation of H3K27me3, an \ninactivation mark, and demethylation of H3K36me2, an activation mark. \nInterestingly, our findings suggest that inhibition of the ERK pathway via \nincreased activity of DUSP3 is epigenetically regulated. Besides, chromatin \nimmunoprecipitation data exhibited augmented H3K36me2 (an activation mark) \nlevels on the DUSP3 promoter region. To the best of our knowledge, we are the \nfirst to report that l-methionine supplementation improves the chemosensitivity \nin Sorafenib-resistant HCC via modulating the epigenetic landscape and can be a \npotential therapeutic strategy.\n\n© 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.\n\nDOI: 10.1002/jbt.23663\nPMID: 38367245 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

By taking advantage of the \nco-existence of epithelial and quasi-mesenchymal cells within immortalized \ncancer cell lines, we have analyzed the role of EMT-related gene isoforms in the \nregulation of epithelial mesenchymal plasticity (EMP) in high grade serous \novarian cancer. When compared with colon cancer, a distinct spectrum of \ndownstream targets characterizes quasi-mesenchymal ovarian cancer cells, likely \nto reflect the different modalities of metastasis formation between these two \ntypes of malignancy, i.e. hematogenous in colon and transcoelomic in ovarian \ncancer. Moreover, upstream RNA-binding proteins differentially expressed between \nepithelial and quasi-mesenchymal subpopulations of ovarian cancer cells were \nidentified that underlie differential regulation of EMT-related isoforms. In \nparticular, the up- and down-regulation of RBM24 and ESRP1, respectively, \nrepresent a main regulator of EMT in ovarian cancer cells. To validate the \nfunctional and clinical relevance of our approach, we selected and functionally \nanalyzed the Tropomyosin 1 gene (TPM1), encoding for a protein that specifies \nthe functional characteristics of individual actin filaments in contractile \ncells, among the ovarian-specific downstream AS targets. The low-molecular \nweight Tpm1.8/9 isoforms are specifically expressed in patient-derived ascites \nand promote invasion through activation of EMT and Wnt signaling, together with \na broad spectrum of inflammation-related pathways. Moreover, Tpm1.8/9 expression \nconfers resistance to taxane- and platinum-based chemotherapy. Small molecule \ninhibitors that target the Tpm1 isoforms support targeting Tpm1.8/9 as \ntherapeutic targets for the development of future tailor-made clinical \ninterventions.\n\n© 2024.

Patients with a history of breast cancer (hereinafter referred to as \nbreast cancer survivors) are at increased risk for subsequent chronic diseases, \nbut the long-term changes in peripheral leukocyte composition following a breast \ncancer diagnosis and treatment remain unknown.\nOBJECTIVE: To examine longitudinal changes in peripheral leukocyte composition \nin women who did and did not develop breast cancer and identify whether \ndifferences in breast cancer survivors were associated with specific treatments.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this prospective cohort study, paired \nblood samples were collected from 2315 women enrolled in The Sister Study, a \nUS-nationwide prospective cohort study of 50 884 women, at baseline (July 2003 \nto March 2009) and follow-up (October 2013 to March 2015) home visits, with a \nmean (SD) follow-up interval of 7.6 (1.4) years. By design, approximately half \nof the included women had been diagnosed and treated for breast cancer after \nenrollment and before the second blood draw. A total of 410 women were included \nin the present study, including 185 breast cancer survivors and 225 who remained \nfree of breast cancer over a comparable follow-up period. Data were analyzed \nfrom April 21 to September 9, 2022.\nEXPOSURES: Breast cancer status and, among breast cancer survivors, cancer \ntreatment type (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, endocrine therapy, or surgery).\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Blood DNA methylation data were generated in 2019 \nusing a genome-wide methylation screening tool and deconvolved to estimate \npercentages of 12 circulating leukocyte subsets.\nRESULTS: Of the 410 women included in the analysis, the mean (SD) age at \nenrollment was 56 (9) years. Compared with breast cancer-free women, breast \ncancer survivors had decreased percentages of circulating eosinophils (-0.45% \n[95% CI, -0.87% to -0.03%]; P = .03), total CD4+ helper T cells (-1.50% [95% CI, \n-2.56% to -0.44%]; P = .01), and memory B cells (-0.22% [95% CI, -0.34% to \n-0.09%]; P = .001) and increased percentages of circulating naive B cells (0.46% \n[95% CI, 0.17%-0.75%]; P = .002). In breast cancer survivor-only analyses, \nradiotherapy was associated with decreases in total CD4+ T cell levels, whereas \nchemotherapy was associated with increases in naive B cell levels. Surgery and \nendocrine therapy were not meaningfully associated with leukocyte changes.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study of 410 women, breast cancer \nsurvivors experienced lasting changes in peripheral leukocyte composition \ncompared with women who remained free of breast cancer. These changes may be \nrelated to treatment with chemotherapy or radiotherapy and could influence \nfuture chronic disease risk.\n\nDOI: 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.56113\nPMCID: PMC10870180\nPMID: 38358741 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: Conflict of Interest Disclosures: None reported."

This study was aimed \nto comprehensive explore the prognostic value of BRAF/RAS mutations, TERT \npromoter mutations, and TERT promoter methylation in PTC.\nMETHODS: The relationships of BRAF/RAS mutations, TERT promoter mutations, and \nTERT promoter methylation with clinical characteristics and outcomes of PTC were \nanalyzed in 382 patients with PTC.\nRESULTS: TERT promoter mutation and hypermethylation were collectively observed \nin 52 (13.6%) samples and associated with BRAF/RAS mutation, aggressive clinical \ncharacteristics, and poor clinical outcomes of PTC. Coexistence of BRAF/RAS and \nTERT alterations was found in 45 of 382 (11.8%) PTC patients and strongly \nassociated with old patient age, extrathyroidal extension, advanced pathologic T \nstage and metastasis. Importantly, patients with both BRAF/RAS and TERT \nalterations had higher rates of tumor recurrence (13.6% vs 1.5%, P = 0.042) and \ndisease progression (24.4% vs 3.3%, P < 0.001) than patients without any \nalterations, and cox regression analysis revealed that the coexistence of \nBRAF/RAS and TERT alterations, but not BRAF/RAS or TERT alterations alone, \nincreased the risk of progression-free interval with an adjusted HR of 10.35 \n(95% CI: 1.79-59.81, P = 0.009).\nCONCLUSIONS: This study suggested that comprehensively analysis of BRAF/RAS \nmutations, TERT promoter mutation and methylation is an effective strategy to \nidentify high-risk patients with PTC.\n\n© 2024.

Since epigenetic mechanisms are suspected to \ncontribute to the multifactorial pathogenesis of CD, we studied CpG methylation \nat the CDH1 locus. The methylation of the CpG island (CGI) and of the 1st \nenhancer, two critical regulatory positions, was quantified in surgical \nspecimens of inflamed ileal mucosa and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells \n(PBMC) of 21 CD patients. Sixteen patients operated on for a non-inflammatory \nbowel disease, although not normal controls, provided a macroscopically normal \nileal mucosa and PBMC for comparison.\nRESULTS: In ileal mucosa, 19/21 (90%) CD patients vs 8/16 control patients (50%) \n(p < 0.01) had a methylated CDH1 promoter CGI. In PBMC, CD patients with \nmethylated CGI were 11/21 (52%) vs 7/16 controls (44%), respectively. \nMethylation in the 1st enhancer of CDH1 was also higher in the CD group for each \nof the studied CpGs and for their average value (45 ± 17% in CD patients vs \n36 ± 17% in controls; p < 0.001). Again, methylation was comparable in PBMC. \nMethylation of CGI and 1st enhancer were not correlated in mucosa or PBMC.\nCONCLUSIONS: Methylation of several CpGs at the CDH1 locus was increased in the \ninflamed ileal mucosa, not in the PBMC, of CD patients, suggesting the \nassociation of CDH1 methylation with ileal inflammation. Longitudinal studies \nwill explore if this increased methylation is a risk marker for colorectal \ncancer.\n\n© 2024.

In addition, immunohistochemistry \nstaining and genetic detection of NUDT21 in HHNCC tumor tissues by \nimmunohistochemistry and qRT-PCR. Then, through in vitro cell experiments, \nNUDT21 was knocked down by lentivirus to detect the proliferation, cycle, \napoptosis of FaDu and CNE-2Z cells, and finally by PathScan intracellular \nsignaling array reagent to detect the apoptotic protein content.\nRESULTS: Based on the pan-cancer analysis, we found that elevated expression of \nNUDT21 in most cancers was significantly correlated with TMB, MSI, neoantigens \nand chromosomal ploidy, and in epigenetics, elevated NUDT21 expression was \nstrongly associated with genomic stability, mismatch repair genes, tumor \nstemness, and RNA methylation. Based on immunosuppressive score, we found that \nNUDT21 plays an essential role in the immunosuppressive environment by \nsuppressing immune checkpointing effect in most cancers. In addition, using \nHHNSCC as a study target, PCR and pathological detection of NUDT21 in tumor \ntissues was significantly increased than that in paracancerous normal tissues. \nIn vitro cellular assays, silencing NUDT21 inhibited proliferation and promoted \napoptosis in FaDu and CNE-2Z cells, and blocked the cell cycle in the G2/M \nphase. Therefore, the experiments confirmed that NUDT21 promotes the \nproliferation of FaDu by suppressing the expression of apoptotic.\n\nDOI: 10.18632/aging.205539\nPMCID: PMC10929839\nPMID: 38349866 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: CONFLICTS OF INTEREST: No potential conflicts of \ninterest were reported by the author(s)."

Due to the scarcity of samples and the tumor's rarity, progress in \ndeveloping effective treatments has been historically limited. To tackle this \nissue, a high-throughput screening of epigenetic drugs was conducted to identify \ncompounds capable of disrupting the invasive properties of the tumor and its \ncancer stem cells (CSCs). ACC cells were screened for changes in tumor \nviability, chromatin decondensation, Snail inhibition along tumor migration, and \ndisruption of cancer stem cells. Seven compounds showed potential clinical \ninterest, and further validation showed that Scriptaid emerged as a promising \ncandidate for treating ACC invasion. Scriptaid demonstrated a favorable cellular \ntoxicity index, effectively inhibited Snail expression, induced hyperacetylation \nof histone, reduced cell migration, and effectively disrupted tumorspheres. \nAdditionally, LMK235 displayed encouraging results in four out of five \nvalidation assays, further highlighting its potential in combating tumor \ninvasion in ACC.

However, the interaction between genetics and \nepigenetics in chemical carcinogenesis is still not fully understood. Here, we \nconstructed an in vitro human lung carcinogenesis model (16HBE-T) by treating \nhuman bronchial epithelial cells with a typical significant carcinogen \nbenzo(a)pyrene (BaP). We identified a novel circular RNA, circ0087385, which was \noverexpressed in 16HBE-T and human lung cancer cell lines, as well as in lung \ncancer tissues and serum exosomes from lung cancer patients. The upregulated \ncirc0087385 after exposure to BaP promoted DNA damage in the early stage of \nchemical carcinogenesis and affected the cell cycle, proliferation, and \napoptosis of the malignantly transformed cells. Overexpression of circ0087385 \nenhanced the expression of cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1), which is crucial for \nmetabolically activating BaP. Interfering with circ0087385 or CYP1A1 reduced the \nlevels of ultimate carcinogen benzo(a)pyrene diol epoxide (BPDE) and BPDE-DNA \nadducts. Interfering with CYP1A1 partially reversed the DNA damage induced by \nhigh expression of circ0087385, as well as decreased the level of BPDE and \nBPDE-DNA adducts. These findings provide novel insights into the interaction \nbetween epigenetics and genetics in chemical carcinogenesis which are crucial \nfor understanding the epigenetic and genetic toxicity of chemicals.\n\n© The Author(s) 2024.

Its prevalence is \ninfluenced by various risk factors, including age, gender, and genetic \npredisposition. This study investigates the association between BC and the \nSirtuin 1 (SIRT1) gene polymorphism rs369274325 in the Turkish population. \nGenomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood samples and genotyping of \nrs369274325 polymorphism in SIRT 1 was investigated in 200 individuals (in 100 \nTurkish bladder cancer patients and 100 healthy individuals as the control \ngroup.) by real-time PCR. Demographic information, smoking and alcohol \nconsumption status was analyzed by statistical analysis. Statistical analysis \nwas performed by Pearson's Chi-square test. Smoking and alcohol consumption were \nsignificantly higher in BC patients compared to controls (p < 0.00018 and \np < 0.0001, respectively). The genotypic distribution of SIRT1 rs369274325 did \nnot show a significant difference between BC patients and controls (p = 0.5550). \nBC, influenced by genetic and environmental factors, has been linked to various \ngene mutations. SIRT1, involved in diverse physiological processes, is proposed \nto play a role in BC. However, our study did not find a significant association \nbetween SIRT1 rs369274325 polymorphism and BC in the Turkish population.\n\nDOI: 10.1080/15257770.2024.2310710\nPMID: 38305254 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Electronic address: r.ameziane@um5r.ac.ma.\n\nCellular senescence is a pathophysiological process with multifaceted effects. \nIt is involved in wound healing, aging and age-related diseases as well as \ncancer. On the one hand, senescence is considered as barrier against \ntumorigenesis by inducing an irreversible/prolonged cell cycle arrest. On the \nother hand, it may promote tumorigenesis when senescent cells accumulate genomic \ninstability and bypass this cell cycle arrest. Interestingly, the bystander \neffects mediate the propagation of the genetic instability from senescent cells \nto their environment through the SASP (Senescence Associated Secretory \nPhenotype) including proinflammatory cytokines, proteases, growth factors and \nReactive Oxygen Species 'ROS.' From several markers explored to detect senescent \ncells (β-galactosidase, p16, p21, p53, heterochromatin foci, DNA damage,…), ROS \narouse particular interest because of their involvement at the chronic \nsupraphysiological level, in the induction and maintain of DNA damage, \ninflammation, cell cycle disruption and epigenetic instability. In this context, \nthe choice of methods to detect ROS in senescent cells is of particular interest \nand must take into account relevant parameters as well as the specificity for \neach species of ROS and the subcellular localization of ROS production. In this \nchapter, we introduce senescence and ROS, we briefly discuss the advantages and \nthe shortcomings of methods routinely used to detect ROS. In addition, we \ndescribe the protocol to detect ROS at mitochondrial level (using the MitoSOX \nstaining) in the BCPAP cell line (from human papillary thyroid carcinomas) \nexpressing BRAFV600E oncogene known to trigger senescence.\n\nCopyright © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

As little is known about the \nmolecular underpinnings of PTs, current diagnosis relies on histological \nexamination. However, accurate classification is often difficult, particularly \nfor distinguishing borderline from malignant PTs. Furthermore, PTs can be \nmisdiagnosed as other tumour types with shared histological features, such as \nfibroadenoma and metaplastic breast cancers. As DNA methylation is a recognised \nhallmark of many cancers, we hypothesised that DNA methylation could provide \nnovel biomarkers for diagnosis and tumour stratification in PTs, whilst also \nallowing insight into the molecular aetiology of this otherwise understudied \ntumour. We generated whole-genome methylation data using the Illumina EPIC \nmicroarray in a novel PT cohort (n = 33) and curated methylation microarray data \nfrom published datasets including PTs and other potentially histopathologically \nsimilar tumours (total n = 817 samples). Analyses revealed that PTs have a \nunique methylome compared to normal breast tissue and to potentially \nhistopathologically similar tumours (metaplastic breast cancer, fibroadenoma and \nsarcomas), with PT-specific methylation changes enriched in gene sets involved \nin KRAS signalling and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Next, we identified 53 \ndifferentially methylated regions (DMRs) (false discovery rate < 0.05) that \nspecifically delineated malignant from non-malignant PTs. The top DMR in both \ndiscovery and validation cohorts was hypermethylation at the HSD17B8 CpG island \npromoter. Matched PT single-cell expression data showed that HSD17B8 had minimal \nexpression in fibroblast (putative tumour) cells. Finally, we created a \nmethylation classifier to distinguish PTs from metaplastic breast cancer \nsamples, where we revealed a likely misdiagnosis for two TCGA metaplastic breast \ncancer samples. In conclusion, DNA methylation alterations are associated with \nPT histopathology and hold the potential to improve our understanding of PT \nmolecular aetiology, diagnostics, and risk stratification. © 2024 The Authors. \nThe Journal of Pathology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of The \nPathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.\n\n© 2024 The Authors.

Programmed cell death (PCD) plays a critical role in \nCRC, offering potential targets for therapy by regulating cell elimination \nprocesses that can suppress tumor growth or trigger cancer cell resistance. \nUnderstanding the complex interplay between PCD mechanisms and CRC pathogenesis \nis crucial. This study aims to construct a PCD-related prognostic signature in \nCRC using machine learning integration, enhancing the precision of CRC prognosis \nprediction.\nMETHOD: We retrieved expression data and clinical information from the Cancer \nGenome Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets. Fifteen forms of PCD \nwere identified, and corresponding gene sets were compiled. Machine learning \nalgorithms, including Lasso, Ridge, Enet, StepCox, survivalSVM, CoxBoost, \nSuperPC, plsRcox, random survival forest (RSF), and gradient boosting machine, \nwere integrated for model construction. The models were validated using six GEO \ndatasets, and the programmed cell death score (PCDS) was established. Further, \nthe model's effectiveness was compared with 109 transcriptome-based CRC \nprognostic models.\nRESULT: Our integrated model successfully identified differentially expressed \nPCD-related genes and stratified CRC samples into four subtypes with distinct \nprognostic implications. The optimal combination of machine learning models, \nRSF + Ridge, showed superior performance compared with traditional methods. The \nPCDS effectively stratified patients into high-risk and low-risk groups, with \nsignificant survival differences. Further analysis revealed the prognostic \nrelevance of immune cell types and pathways associated with CRC subtypes. The \nmodel also identified hub genes and drug sensitivities relevant to CRC \nprognosis.\nCONCLUSION: The current study highlights the potential of integrating machine \nlearning models to enhance the prediction of CRC prognosis. The developed \nprognostic signature, which is related to PCD, holds promise for personalized \nand effective therapeutic interventions in CRC.\n\n© 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.\n\nDOI: 10.1002/tox.24157\nPMID: 38299230 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Exposure to asbestos is a frequent \ncause. However, studies in rodents have shown that certain multiwalled carbon \nnanotubes (MWCNTs) can also induce malignant mesothelioma. The exact mechanisms \nare still unclear. To gain further insights into molecular pathways leading to \ncarcinogenesis, we analyzed tumors in Wistar rats induced by intraperitoneal \napplication of MWCNTs and amosite asbestos. Using transcriptomic and epigenetic \napproaches, we compared the tumors by inducer (MWCNTs or amosite asbestos) or by \ntumor type (sarcomatoid, epithelioid, or biphasic).\nRESULTS: Genome-wide transcriptome datasets, whether grouped by inducer or tumor \ntype, showed a high number of significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) \nrelative to control peritoneal tissues. Bioinformatic evaluations using \nIngenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) revealed that while the transcriptome datasets \nshared commonalities, they also showed differences in DEGs, regulated canonical \npathways, and affected molecular functions. In all datasets, among highly- \nscoring predicted canonical pathways were Phagosome Formation, IL8 Signaling, \nIntegrin Signaling, RAC Signaling, and TREM1 Signaling. Top-scoring activated \nmolecular functions included cell movement, invasion of cells, migration of \ncells, cell transformation, and metastasis. Notably, we found many genes \nassociated with malignant mesothelioma in humans, which showed similar \nexpression changes in the rat tumor transcriptome datasets. Furthermore, RT-qPCR \nrevealed downregulation of Hrasls, Nr4a1, Fgfr4, and Ret or upregulation of Rnd3 \nand Gadd45b in all or most of the 36 tumors analyzed. Bisulfite sequencing of \nHrasls, Nr4a1, Fgfr4, and Ret revealed heterogeneity in DNA methylation of \npromoter regions. However, higher methylation percentages were observed in some \ntumors compared to control tissues. Lastly, global 5mC DNA, m6A RNA and 5mC RNA \nmethylation levels were also higher in tumors than in control tissues.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings may help better understand how exposure to MWCNTs can \nlead to carcinogenesis. This information is valuable for risk assessment and in \nthe development of safe-by-design strategies.\n\n© 2024.

The miR-21 gene is situated on chromosome \n17q23.2, positioned at the 3'-UTR of the gene that encodes vacuole membrane \nprotein-1 (VMP1). In this current study, we presented evidence indicating that \nmiR-21 possesses its own gene promoter, which can be found in the intron 10 of \nthe VMP1 gene. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by global DNA sequencing \n(ChIP-seq) revealed the presence of a broad H3K4me3 peak spanning the entire \ngene body of the primary miR-21 and the existence of super-enhancer clusters in \nthe close proximity to both the miR-21 gene promoter and the transcription \ntermination site in arsenic (As3+)-induced cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) and \nhuman induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). In non-transformed human \nbronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B), As3+ treatment enhanced Nrf2 binding to \nboth the host gene VMP1 of miR-21 and the miR-21 gene. Knockout of Nrf2 \ninhibited both the basal and As3+-induced expressions of miR-21. Furthermore, \nthe As3+-enhanced Nrf2 peaks in ChIP-seq fully overlap with these \nsuper-enhancers enriched with H3K4me1 and H3K27ac in the miR-21 gene, suggesting \nthat Nrf2 may coordinate with other transcription factors through the \nsuper-enhancers to regulate the expression of miR-21 in cellular response to \nAs3+. These findings demonstrate the unique genetic and epigenetic \ncharacteristics of miR-21 and may provide insights into understanding the novel \nmechanisms linking environmental As3+ exposure and human cancers.\n\nCopyright © 2024 The Authors.

Differences in genetic susceptibility mechanisms may contribute to this \ndisparity.\nMETHODS: To gain insights into the regulatory mechanisms of prostate cancer \nsusceptibility variants, we tested the association between SNPs and DNA \nmethylation (DNAm) at nearby CpG sites across the genome in benign and cancer \nprostate tissue from 74 AA and 74 EA men. Genome-wide SNP data (from benign \ntissue) and DNAm were generated using Illumina arrays.\nRESULTS: Among AA men, we identified 6,298 and 2,641 cis-methylation QTLs \n(meQTL; FDR of 0.05) in benign and tumor tissue, respectively, with 6,960 and \n1,700 detected in EA men. We leveraged genome-wide association study (GWAS) \nsummary statistics to identify previously reported prostate cancer GWAS signals \nlikely to share a common causal variant with a detected meQTL. We identified \nnine GWAS-meQTL pairs with strong evidence of colocalization (four in EA benign, \nthree in EA tumor, two in AA benign, and three in AA tumor). Among these \ncolocalized GWAS-meQTL pairs, we identified colocalizing expression quantitative \ntrait loci (eQTL) impacting four eGenes with known roles in tumorigenesis.\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight epigenetic regulatory mechanisms by which \nprostate cancer-risk SNPs can modify local DNAm and/or gene expression in \nprostate tissue.\nIMPACT: Overall, our findings showed general consistency in the meQTL landscape \nof AA and EA men, but meQTLs often differ by tissue type (normal vs. cancer). \nAncestry-based linkage disequilibrium differences and lack of AA representation \nin GWAS decrease statistical power to detect colocalization for some regions.\n\n©2024 American Association for Cancer Research.\n\nDOI: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-23-0849\nPMCID: PMC10990789\nPMID: 38294689 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: Conflict of Interest Statement: The author \ndeclare no potential conflicts of interest."

It is exceptionally used as an \ninsecticide for malaria control. Exposure occurs in regions where DDT is \napplied, as well as in the Arctic, where its endocrine disrupting metabolite, \np, p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p, p'-DDE) accumulates in marine mammals \nand fish. DDT and p, p'-DDE exposures are linked to birth defects, infertility, \ncancer, and neurodevelopmental delays. Of particular concern is the potential of \nDDT use to impact the health of generations to come via the heritable sperm \nepigenome.\nOBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to assess the sperm epigenome in \nrelation to p, p'-DDE serum levels between geographically diverse populations.\nMETHODS: In the Limpopo Province of South Africa, we recruited 247 VhaVenda \nSouth African men and selected 50 paired blood serum and semen samples, and 47 \nGreenlandic Inuit blood and semen paired samples were selected from a total of \n193 samples from the biobank of the INUENDO cohort, an EU Fifth Framework \nProgramme Research and Development project. Sample selection was based on \nobtaining a range of p, p'-DDE serum levels (mean = 870.734 ± 134.030 ng/mL). We \nassessed the sperm epigenome in relation to serum p, p'-DDE levels using \nMethylC-Capture-sequencing (MCC-seq) and chromatin immunoprecipitation followed \nby sequencing (ChIP-seq). We identified genomic regions with altered DNA \nmethylation (DNAme) and differential enrichment of histone H3 lysine 4 \ntrimethylation (H3K4me3) in sperm.\nRESULTS: Differences in DNAme and H3K4me3 enrichment were identified at \ntransposable elements and regulatory regions involved in fertility, disease, \ndevelopment, and neurofunction. A subset of regions with sperm DNAme and H3K4me3 \nthat differed between exposure groups was predicted to persist in the \npreimplantation embryo and to be associated with embryonic gene expression.\nDISCUSSION: These findings suggest that DDT and p, p'-DDE exposure impacts the \nsperm epigenome in a dose-response-like manner and may negatively impact the \nhealth of future generations through epigenetic mechanisms. Confounding factors, \nsuch as other environmental exposures, genetic diversity, and selection bias, \ncannot be ruled out. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP12013.\n\nDOI: 10.1289/EHP12013\nPMCID: PMC10829569\nPMID: 38294233 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Assessing the scope and intensity \nof this process in the colon may support risk prediction and colorectal cancer \nprevention.\nMETHODS: The Swiss Epigenetic Colorectal Cancer Study (SWEPIC) study, \nencompassing 1111 participants for DNA methylation analysis and a subset of 84 \nfor RNA sequencing, was employed to detect field cancerization in individuals \nwith adenomatous polyps (AP). Methylation variations were evaluated for their \ndiscriminative capability, including in external cohorts, genomic localization, \nclinical correlations, and associated RNA expression patterns.\nRESULTS: Normal cecal tissue of individuals harboring an AP in the proximal \ncolon manifested dysregulated DNA methylation compared to tissue from healthy \nindividuals at 558 unique loci. Leveraging these adenoma-related differentially \nvariable and methylated CpGs (aDVMCs), our classifier discerned between healthy \nand AP-adjacent tissues across SWEPIC datasets (cross-validated area under the \nreceiver operating characteristic curve [ROC AUC] = 0.63-0.81), including within \nage-stratified cohorts. This discriminative capacity was validated in 3 external \nsets, differentiating healthy from cancer-adjacent tissue (ROC AUC = 0.82-0.88). \nNotably, aDVMC dysregulation correlated with polyp multiplicity. More than 50% \nof aDVMCs were significantly associated with age. These aDVMCs were enriched in \nactive regions of the genome (P < .001), and associated genes exhibited altered \nexpression in AP-adjacent tissues.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings underscore the early onset of field cancerization in \nthe right colon during the neoplastic transformation process. A more extensive \nvalidation of aDVMC dysregulation as a stratification tool could pave the way \nfor enhanced surveillance approaches, especially given its linkage to adenoma \nemergence.\n\n© The Author(s) 2024.

Early detection is crucial to reduce lung cancer-related \nmortality. Aberrant DNA methylation occurs early during carcinogenesis and can \nbe detected in blood. It is essential to investigate the dysregulated blood \nmethylation markers for early diagnosis of NSCLC.\nMETHODS: NSCLC-associated methylation gene folate receptor gamma (FOLR3) was \nselected from an Illumina 850K array analysis of peripheral blood samples. Mass \nspectrometry was used for validation in two independent case-control studies \n(validation I: n = 2548; validation II: n = 3866). Patients with lung squamous \ncarcinoma (LUSC) or lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), normal controls (NCs) and benign \npulmonary nodule (BPN) cases were included. FOLR3 methylations were compared \namong different populations. Their associations with NSCLC clinical features \nwere investigated. Receiver operating characteristic analyses, Kruskal-Wallis \ntest, Wilcoxon test, logistics regression analysis and nomogram analysis were \nperformed.\nRESULTS: Two CpG sites (CpG_1 and CpG_2) of FOLR3 was significantly lower \nmethylated in NSCLC patients than NCs in the discovery round. In the two \nvalidations, both LUSC and LUAD patients presented significant FOLR3 \nhypomethylations. LUSC patients were highlighted to have significantly lower \nmethylation levels of CpG_1 and CpG_2 than BPN cases and LUAD patients. Both in \nthe two validations, CpG_1 methylation and CpG_2 methylation could discriminate \nLUSC from NCs well, with areas under the curve (AUCs) of 0.818 and 0.832 in \nvalidation I, and 0.789 and 0.780 in validation II. They could also \ndifferentiate LUAD from NCs, but with lower efficiency. CpG_1 and CpG_2 \nmethylations could also discriminate LUSC from BPNs well individually in the two \nvalidations. With the combined dataset of two validations, the independent \nassociations of age, gender, and FOLR3 methylation with LUSC and LUAD risk were \nshown and the age-gender-CpG_1 signature could discriminate LUSC and LUAD from \nNCs and BPNs, with higher efficiency for LUSC.\nCONCLUSIONS: Blood-based FOLR3 hypomethylation was shown in LUSC and LUAD. FOLR3 \nmethylation heterogeneity between LUSC and LUAD highlighted its stronger \nassociations with LUSC. FOLR3 methylation and the age-gender-CpG_1 signature \nmight be novel diagnostic markers for the early detection of NSCLC, especially \nfor LUSC.\n\n© 2024.

Breast tissue is particularly susceptible to \nstimuli in early life. Only limited data are available on associations of \none-carbon metabolism-related vitamin intake during youth and young adulthood \nwith breast density, a strong risk factor for breast cancer.\nMETHODS: Over 18 years in the DISC and DISC06 Follow-up Study, diets of 182 \nyoung women were assessed by three 24-hour recalls on five occasions at ages 8 \nto 18 years and once at 25 to 29 years. Multivariable-adjusted linear \nmixed-effects regression was used to examine associations of intakes of \none-carbon metabolism-related vitamins with MRI-measured percent dense breast \nvolume (%DBV) and absolute dense breast volume (ADBV) at ages 25 to 29 years.\nRESULTS: Folate intake in youth was inversely associated with %DBV (Ptrend = \n0.006) and ADBV (Ptrend = 0.02). These inverse associations were observed with \nintake during post-, though not premenarche. In contrast, premenarche vitamin B2 \nintake was positively associated with ADBV (Ptrend < 0.001). Young adult folate \nand vitamin B6 intakes were inversely associated with %DBV (all Ptrend ≤ 0.04), \nwhereas vitamins B6 and B12 were inversely associated with ADBV (all Ptrend ≤ \n0.04).\nCONCLUSIONS: Among these DISC participants intakes of one-carbon \nmetabolism-related vitamins were associated with breast density. Larger \nprospective studies among diverse populations are needed to replicate these \nfindings.\nIMPACT: Our results suggest the importance of one-carbon metabolism-related \nvitamin intakes early in life with development of breast density and thereby \npotentially breast cancer risk later in life.\n\n©2024 American Association for Cancer Research.\n\nDOI: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-23-1279\nPMCID: PMC11038423\nPMID: 38270539 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: Conflict of Interest disclosure: Authors declare \nthey have no conflicts of interest."

Cervical cancer studies suggest that HPV DNA \nmethylation changes can be used as a biomarker to discriminate cancer patients \nfrom HPV-infected individuals. As such, this study was designed to establish a \nprotocol to evaluate DNA methylation changes in HPV late genes and long control \nregion (LCR) in saliva samples of HPV-HNC patients and HPV-positive controls. \nHigher methylation levels were detected in HPV late genes (L1 and L2) in both \ntumour and saliva samples of HPV-HNC patients compared with HPV-positive \ncontrols. Moreover, methylation patterns between tumours and corresponding \nsaliva samples were observed to have a strong correlation (Passing-Bablok \nregression analysis; τ = 0.7483, P < 0.0001). Considering the differences \nbetween HNC and controls in methylation levels in late genes, and considering \nprimer amplification efficiencies, 13 CpG sites located at L1 and L2 genes were \nselected for further evaluation. A total of 18 HNC saliva samples and 10 control \nsaliva samples were assessed for the methylation levels in the selected sites. \nFrom the CpG sites evaluated statistically significant differences were \nidentified for CpG sites at L2-CpG 6 (P = 0.0004), L1-CpG 3 (P = 0.0144), L1-CpG \n2 (P = 0.0395) and L2-CpG 19 (P = 0.0455). Our pilot data indicate that higher \nlevels of DNA methylation in HPV late genes are indicative of HPV-HNC risk, and \nit is a potential supplementary biomarker for salivary HPV detection-based \nHPV-HNC screening.\n\n© The Author(s) 2024.

In this study, the association between \nB. thetaiotaomicron, a gut microbiota species, and HCC recurrence, as well as \npatient clinical outcomes, was investigated. It was observed that B. \nthetaiotaomicron-derived acetic acid has the potential to modulate the \npolarization of pro-pro-inflammatory macrophagess, which promotes the function \nof cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. The increased biosynthesis of fatty acids was \nimplicated in the modulation of pro-inflammatory macrophages polarization by B. \nthetaiotaomicron-derived acetic acid. Furthermore, B. thetaiotaomicron-derived \nacetic acid was found to facilitate the transcription of ACC1, a key enzyme \ninvolved in fatty acid biosynthesis, through histone acetylation modification in \nthe ACC1 promoter region. Curcumin, an acetylation modification inhibitor, \nsignificantly blocked the inhibitory effects of B. thetaiotaomicron and acetic \nacid on HCC tumor growth. These findings highlight the potential role of gut \nmicrobiota-derived acetic acid in HCC recurrence and patient clinical outcomes, \nand suggest a complex interplay between gut microbiota, immune modulation, fatty \nacid metabolism, and epigenetic regulation in the context of HCC development. \nFurther research in this area may provide insights into novel strategies for HCC \nprevention and treatment by targeting the gut microbiota and its metabolites.\n\nDOI: 10.1080/19490976.2023.2297846\nPMCID: PMC10813637\nPMID: 38270111 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: Authors declare there are not any competing \nfinancial interests in relation to the work described."

Various \ngenetic and environmental factors play important roles in the emergence of \ncolorectal adenocarcinoma. Non-coding RNAs, approximately 20-22 nucleotides, are \ntranscribed irregularly in many cancer cells and play a critical role in many \nmetabolic pathways in clinical cancer cases. DNA methylation is a critical \nepigenetic alteration that controls gene expression. In the current study, \ntranscriptional silencing and CpG hypermethylation were developed as a \ntherapeutic gene editing strategy for the clinical repression of colorectal \nadenocarcinoma.\nMETHODS: A human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line (Caco2) and a normal lung \nfibroblast cell line (Wi38) were utilized as the paradigms in this research to \nexamine the effect of mir155 molecule transfection and CpGs-island (CGI) \nmethylation. Cell counting was achieved using six-well and 24-well plates before \ntransfection using a hemocytometer. The two cell lines were transfected with the \nmir155 agomir and antagomir molecules. The transfection efficiency, cell \nviability, cell IC50, and target gene expression were measured, and \nCGIs-methylation was achieved by bisulfate conversion.\nRESULTS: The outcomes revealed the downregulation of oncogenes (AKT1 and VCAM1 \ngenes as cancer-associated genes) and the upregulation of tumor suppressor genes \n(TSGs, Tp53 and KEAP1). In addition, CpG-islands methylation showed significant \nblocking of the oncogene promoter regions, and the switch on of TSG promoter \nregions was continuous.\nCONCLUSIONS: miRNA-CGI-methylation led to the regression of Caco2 cell \nproliferation, suggesting the potential use of RNA silencing and DNA methylation \nin targeted gene therapy for colorectal cancer.\n\nDOI: 10.4166/kjg.2023.132\nPMID: 38268163 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

However, the mechanisms underlying \nthe relationship is still unclear. Plasma microRNA (miRNA) is a typical \nepigenetic biomarker that was linked to environment exposure and lung cancer \ndevelopment. We aimed to reveal the mediation effect of plasma miRNAs on \nBaP-related lung cancer. We designed a lung cancer case-control study including \n136 lung cancer patients and 136 controls, and measured the adducts of \nbenzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide-albumin (BPDE-Alb) and sequenced miRNA profiles in \nplasma. The relationships between BPDE-Alb adducts, normalized miRNA levels and \nthe risk of lung cancer were assessed by linear regression models. The mediation \neffects of miRNAs on BaP-related lung cancer were investigated. A total of 190 \nplasma miRNAs were significantly related to lung cancer status at Bonferroni \nadjusted P < 0.05, among which 57 miRNAs showed different levels with |fold \nchange| > 2 between plasma samples before and after tumor resection surgery at \nBonferroni adjusted P < 0.05. Especially, among the 57 lung cancer-associated \nmiRNAs, BPDE-Alb adducts were significantly related to miR-17-3p, miR-20a-3p, \nmiR-135a-5p, miR-374a-5p, miR-374b-5p, miR-423-5p and miR-664a-5p, which could \nin turn mediate a separate 42.2%, 33.0%, 57.5%, 36.4%, 48.8%, 32.5% and 38.2% of \nthe relationship of BPDE-Alb adducts with the risk of lung cancer.

One potential mechanism for the effects \nof environmental factors is through epigenetic modifications that affect gene \nexpression without changing the underlying DNA sequence. However, the functional \ncooperation between dietary factors and cancer-causing epigenetic regulation is \nlargely unknown. Here, we use a mouse model of age-dependent p16 epimutation, in \nwhich the p16 gene activity is directly controlled by promoter DNA methylation. \nWe show p16 epimutation is modulated by folate and cofactors in dietary \nsupplementation, which leads to increased colon cancer risk.

Here, we investigated the \nhistopathologic and molecular profiles of precancerous gastric cardia lesions \n(PGCLs) and biomarkers for risk stratification of gastric cardia IM.\nMETHODS: We conducted a hospital-based evaluation (n = 4578) for PGCL profiles \nin high-incidence and non-high-incidence regions for GCC in China. We next \nperformed 850K methylation arrays (n = 42) and RNA-seq (n = 44) in tissues with \nPGCLs. We then examined the protein expression of candidate biomarker using \nimmunohistochemistry.\nRESULTS: Of the 4578 participants, 791 were diagnosed with PGCLs (600 IM, 62 IM \nwith IEN, and 129 IEN). We found that individuals from high-incidence regions \n(26.7%) were more likely to develop PGCLs than those from non-high-incidence \nareas (13.5%). DNA methylation and gene expression alterations, indicated by \ndifferentially methylated probes (DMPs) and differentially expressed genes \n(DEGs), exhibited a progressive increase from type I IM (DMP = 210, DEG = 24), \ntype II IM (DMP = 3402, DEG = 129), to type III IM (DMP = 3735, DEG = 328), \npeaking in IEN (DMP = 47 373, DEG = 2278). Three DEGs with aberrant promoter \nmethylation were identified, shared exclusively by type III IM and IEN. Of these \nDEGs, we found that OLFM4 expression appears in IMs and increases remarkably in \nIENs (P < .001).\nCONCLUSIONS: We highlight that type III IM and IEN share similar epigenetic and \ntranscriptional features in gastric cardia and propose biomarkers with potential \nutility in risk prediction.\n\n© The Author(s) 2024.

Although tumor cells are surrounded by many immune cells \nsuch as macrophages, T cells may be suppressed, be inactivated, or not be \npresented due to various mechanisms, which usually results in poor prognosis and \ninsensitivity to immunotherapy. Immunotherapy is considered a promising \nanti-cancer therapy in osteosarcoma but requires more research, but osteosarcoma \ndoes not currently respond well to this therapy. The cancer immunity cycle (CIC) \nis essential for anti-tumor immunity, and is epigenetically regulated. \nTherefore, it is possible to modulate the immune microenvironment of \nosteosarcoma by targeting epigenetic factors. In this study, we explored the \ncorrelation between epigenetic modulation and CIC in osteosarcoma through \nbioinformatic methods. Based on the RNA data from TARGET and GSE21257 cohorts, \nwe identified epigenetic related subtypes by NMF clustering and constructed a \nclinical prognostic model by the LASSO algorithm. ESTIMATE, Cibersort, and xCell \nalgorithms were applied to analyze the tumor microenvironment. Based on eight \nepigenetic biomarkers (SFMBT2, SP140, CBX5, HMGN2, SMARCA4, PSIP1, ACTR6, and \nCHD2), two subtypes were identified, and they are mainly distinguished by immune \nresponse and cell cycle regulation. After excluding ACTR6 by LASSO regression, \nthe prognostic model was established and it exhibited good predictive efficacy. \nThe risk score showed a strong correlation with the tumor microenvironment, drug \nsensitivity and many immune checkpoints. In summary, our study sheds a new light \non the CIC-related epigenetic modulation mechanism of osteosarcoma and helps \nsearch for potential drugs for osteosarcoma treatment.\n\n© 2024.

Average age was 65.5 \n(cases) and 63.2 (controls) years. Mean sensitivity in the VS from \ncross-validation was 95.2% for colorectal cancer and 57.2% for APLs, with \nspecificities of 89.8% (no CRC/APLs) and 92.4% (no neoplasia). Subgroup analyses \nshowed colorectal cancer sensitivities of 93.4% (stage I) and 94.2% (stage II). \nAPL sensitivity was 82.9% for high-grade dysplasia, 73.4% for villous lesions, \n49.8% for tubular lesions, and 30.2% for SSLs. These data support high \nsensitivity and specificity for a next-generation mt-sDNA test panel. Further \nevaluation of assay performance will be characterized in a prospective, \nmulti-center clinical validation study (NCT04144738).\nPREVENTION RELEVANCE: This study highlights performance of the next-generation \nmt-sDNA test, which exhibits high sensitivity and specificity for detecting \ncolorectal cancer and APLs. This noninvasive option has potential to increase \nscreening participation and clinical outcomes. A multi-center, clinical \nvalidation trial is underway.

However, the pathological and \nmolecular mechanisms of SSL with dysplasia (SSLD) are unclear. Here, we aimed to \nexamine the clinicopathological and molecular alterations in SSLD and to \nevaluate the significance of such alterations with regard to lesion progression. \nFifty-four SSLDs (20 serrated dysplasia cases and 17 intestinal dysplasia cases, \nincluding 30 low-grade dysplasia [LGD] cases, 7 high-grade dysplasia [HGD] \ncases, and 17 intramucosal adenocarcinomas [IMAs]) were evaluated. Molecular \nalterations, including immunohistochemical expression of various markers, DNA \nmethylation status, and multiple genetic mutations (using next-generation \nsequencing), were assessed. Additionally, such alterations were also \ninvestigated in 41 CRCs with an MSI phenotype (invasion beyond submucosa). The \nfrequency of mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency in SSLD was 12 of 39 cases \n(32.4 %), whereas the MMR proficient type was observed in 17 of 39 SSLD cases. \nSSLD with serrated dysplasia showed a significantly higher frequency of loss of \nMMR protein expression and methylation status. Moreover, loss of MMR protein \nexpression differed significantly between LGD and IMA. Furthermore, the \nfrequency of TP53 mutation was significantly higher in IMA than in LGD. The \ncurrent findings demonstrated that SSL with serrated dysplasia may be associated \nwith an increased risk of malignant transformation compared with intestinal \ndysplasia. Loss of MMR proteins and mutation of TP53 may play important roles in \ntumor progression from dysplasia to carcinomatous lesions.\n\nCopyright © 2024 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Epigenetics is the study of heritable changes in characteristics \nbeyond the DNA sequence. Epigenetic information is essential for maintaining \nspecific expression patterns of genes and the normal development of individuals, \nand disorders of epigenetic modifications may alter the expression of oncogenes \nand tumor suppressor genes and affect the development of cancer. This study \nelucidates the relationship between epigenetics and the prognosis of CRC \npatients by developing a predictive model to explore the potential value of \nepigenetics in the treatment of CRC.\nMETHODS: Gene expression data of CRC patients' tumor tissue and controls were \ndownloaded from GEO database. Combined with the 720 epigenetic-related genes \n(ERGs) downloaded from EpiFactors database, prognosis-related epigenetic genes \nwere selected by univariate cox and LASSO analyses. The Kaplan-Meier and ROC \ncurve were used to analyze the accuracy of the model. Data of 238 CRC samples \nwith survival data downloaded from the GSE17538 were used for validation. \nFinally, the risk model is combined with the clinical characteristics of CRC \npatients to perform univariate and multivariate cox regression analysis to \nobtain independent risk factors and draw nomogram. Then we evaluated the \naccuracy of its prediction by calibration curves.\nRESULTS: A total of 2906 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified \nbetween CRC and control samples. After overlapping DEGs with 720 ERGs, 56 \nepigenetic-related DEGs (DEERGs) were identified. Combining univariate and LASSO \nregression analysis, the 8 epigenetic-related genes-based risk score model of \nCRC was established. The ROC curves and survival difference of high and low risk \ngroups revealed the good performance of the risk score model based on prognostic \nbiomarkers in both training and validation sets. A nomogram with good \nperformance to predict the survival of CRC patients were established based on \nage, NM stage and risk score. The calibration curves showed that the prognostic \nmodel had good predictive performance.\nCONCLUSION: In this study, an epigenetically relevant 8-gene signature was \nconstructed that can effectively predict the prognosis of CRC patients and \nprovide potential directions for targeted therapies for CRC.\n\n© 2024.

Although \nPRS is used in clinical practice to predict breast cancer risk, it is more \naccurate for Europeans than for non-Europeans because of the sample size of \ntraining genome-wide association studies (GWAS). To address this disparity, we \nconstructed a PRS model for predicting the risk of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in \nthe Korean population.\nRESULTS: Using GWAS analysis, we identified 43 Korean-specific variants and \ncalculated the PRS. Subsequent to plotting receiver operating characteristic \n(ROC) curves, we selected the 31 best-performing variants to construct an \noptimal PRS model. The resultant PRS model with 31 variants demonstrated a \nprediction rate of 77.4%. The pathway analysis indicated that the identified \nnon-coding variants are involved in regulating the expression of genes related \nto cancer initiation and progression. Notably, favorable lifestyle habits, such \nas avoiding tobacco and alcohol, mitigated the risk of RCC across PRS strata \nexpressing genetic risk.\nCONCLUSION: A Korean-specific PRS model was established to predict the risk of \nRCC in the underrepresented Korean population. Our findings suggest that \nlifestyle-associated factors influencing RCC risk are associated with acquired \nrisk factors indirectly through epigenetic modification, even among individuals \nin the higher PRS category.\n\n© 2024.

Electronic address: angelica.ortiz@nyulangone.org.\n\nCancer cells release extracellular vesicles (EVs) that participate in altering \nthe proximal tumor environment and distal tissues to promote cancer progression. \nChronic exposure to nickel (Ni), a human group I carcinogen, results in \nepigenetic changes that promotes epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). \nCells that undergo EMT demonstrate various molecular changes, including elevated \nlevels of the mesenchymal cadherin N-cadherin (N-CAD) and the transcription \nfactor Zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1). Moreover, the molecular \nchanges following EMT induce changes in cellular behavior, including \nanchorage-independent growth, which contributes to cancer cells detaching from \ntumor bulk during the metastatic process. Here, we present data demonstrating \nthat EVs from Ni-exposed cells induce EMT in recipient BEAS-2B cells in the \nabsence of Ni. Moreover, we show evidence that the EVs from Ni-altered cells \npackage the transcription factor nuclear protein 1 (NUPR1), a transcription \nfactor associated with Ni exposure and cancer progression. Moreover, our data \ndemonstrates that the NUPR1 in the EVs becomes part of the recipient cell \nproteomic milieu and carry the NUPR1 to the nuclear space of the recipient cell. \nInterestingly, knockdown of NUPR1 in Ni-transformed cells suppressed NUPR1 \npackaging in the EVs, and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) demonstrated \ndecreased EV release. Reduction of NUPR1 in EVs resulted in diminished EMT \ncapacity that resulted in decreased anchorage independent growth. This study is \nthe first to demonstrate the role of NUPR1 in extracellular vesicle-mediate \ncancer progression.\n\nCopyright © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

We also evaluated the interaction of current smoking \nwith sex or diet (fibre, folate, and vitamin C).\nFINDINGS: Using false discovery rate (FDR < 0.05), 65,857 CpGs were \ndifferentially methylated in relation to current smoking, 4025 with recent \nquitting, 594 with in utero exposure, and 6 with ETS. Most current smoking CpGs \nattenuated within a year of quitting. CpGs related to in utero exposure in \nadults were enriched for those previously observed in newborns. Differential \nmethylation by current smoking at 4-71 CpGs may be modified by sex or dietary \nintake. Nearly half (35-50%) of differentially methylated CpGs on the 450 K \narray were associated with blood gene expression. Current smoking and in utero \nsmoking CpGs implicated 3049 and 1067 druggable targets, including chemotherapy \ndrugs.\nINTERPRETATION: Many smoking-related methylation sites were identified with \nIllumina's EPIC array. Most signals revert to levels observed in never smokers \nwithin a year of cessation. Many in utero smoking CpGs persist into adulthood. \nSmoking-related druggable targets may provide insights into cancer treatment \nresponse and shared mechanisms across smoking-related diseases.\nFUNDING: Intramural Research Program of the National Institutes of Health, \nNorwegian Ministry of Health and Care Services and the Ministry of Education and \nResearch, Chief Scientist Office of the Scottish Government Health Directorates \nand the Scottish Funding Council, Medical Research Council UK and the Wellcome \nTrust.\n\nCopyright © 2024 The Authors.

We employ a \nsynergistic experimental and mathematical modelling approach to explore the \nevolutionary processes at the root of cancer cell adaptation to glucose \ndeprivation, with particular focus on the mechanisms underlying the increase in \nMCT1 expression observed in glucose-deprived aggressive cancer cells. Data from \nin vitro experiments on breast cancer cells are used to inform and calibrate a \nmathematical model that comprises a partial integro-differential equation for \nthe dynamics of a population of cancer cells structured by the level of MCT1 \nexpression. Analytical and numerical results of this model suggest that \nenvironment-induced changes in MCT1 expression mediated by lactate-associated \nsignalling pathways enable a prompt adaptive response of glucose-deprived cancer \ncells, while fluctuations in MCT1 expression due to epigenetic changes create \nthe substrate for environmental selection to act upon, speeding up the selective \nsweep underlying cancer cell adaptation to glucose deprivation, and may \nconstitute a long-term bet-hedging mechanism.\n\nDOI: 10.1098/rsif.2023.0587\nPMCID: PMC10777142\nPMID: 38196375 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: We declare we have no competing interests."

Its incidence is skyrocketing due to the increase in risk \nfactors such as obesity, which represents a true pandemic. This study aimed to \nevaluate microRNA (miRNA) expression in obesity-related EC to identify potential \nassociations between this specific cancer type and obesity. miRNA levels were \nanalyzed in 84 EC patients stratified based on body mass index (BMI; ≥30 or <30) \nand nine noncancer women with obesity. The data were further tested in The \nCancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort, including 384 EC patients, 235 with BMI ≥30 \nand 149 with BMI <30. Prediction of miRNA targets and analysis of their \nexpression were also performed to identify the potential epigenetic networks \ninvolved in obesity modulation. In the EC cohort, BMI ≥30 was significantly \nassociated with 11 deregulated miRNAs. The topmost deregulated miRNAs were first \nanalyzed in 84 EC samples by single miRNA assay and then tested in the TCGA \ndataset. This independent validation provided further confirmation about the \nsignificant difference of three miRNAs (miR-199a-5p, miR-449a, miR-449b-5p) in \nnormal-weight EC patients versus EC patients with obesity, resulting \nsignificantly higher expressed in the latter. Moreover, the three miRNAs were \nsignificantly correlated with grade, histological type, and overall survival. \nAnalysis of their target genes revealed that these miRNAs may regulate \nobesity-related pathways. In conclusion, we identified specific miRNAs \nassociated with BMI that are potentially involved in modulating obesity-related \npathways and that may provide novel implications for the clinical management of \nobese EC patients.\n\n© 2023 The Authors.

DNA-methylation profiling \nis the current classification 'gold-standard', typically delivered 3-4 weeks \npost-surgery. Pre-surgery non-invasive diagnostics thus offer significant \npotential to improve early diagnosis and clinical management. Here, we determine \ntumour metabolite profiles of the four medulloblastoma groups, assess their \ndiagnostic utility using tumour tissue and potential for non-invasive diagnosis \nusing in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).\nMETHODS: Metabolite profiles were acquired by high-resolution magic-angle \nspinning NMR spectroscopy (MAS) from 86 medulloblastomas (from 59 male and 27 \nfemale patients), previously classified by DNA-methylation array (WNT (n = 9), \nSHH (n = 22), Group3 (n = 21), Group4 (n = 34)); RNA-seq data was available for \nsixty. Unsupervised class-discovery was performed and a support vector machine \n(SVM) constructed to assess diagnostic performance. The SVM classifier was \nadapted to use only metabolites (n = 10) routinely quantified from in vivo MRS \ndata, and re-tested. Glutamate was assessed as a predictor of overall survival.\nFINDINGS: Group-specific metabolite profiles were identified; tumours clustered \nwith good concordance to their reference molecular group (93%). GABA was only \ndetected in WNT, taurine was low in SHH and lipids were high in Group3. The \ntissue-based metabolite SVM classifier had a cross-validated accuracy of 89% \n(100% for WNT) and, adapted to use metabolites routinely quantified in vivo, \ngave a combined classification accuracy of 90% for SHH, Group3 and Group4. \nGlutamate predicted survival after incorporating known risk-factors (HR = 3.39, \n95% CI 1.4-8.1, p = 0.025).\nINTERPRETATION: Tissue metabolite profiles characterise medulloblastoma \nmolecular groups. Their combination with machine learning can aid rapid \ndiagnosis from tissue and potentially in vivo. Specific metabolites provide \nimportant information; GABA identifying WNT and glutamate conferring poor \nprognosis.\nFUNDING: Children with Cancer UK, Cancer Research UK, Children's Cancer North \nand a Newcastle University PhD studentship.\n\nCopyright © 2024 The Authors.

Bisulfite conversion and fluorescence quantitative methylation-specific \npolymerase chain reaction were used to detect the Septin9 methylation status and \ndistribution levels in patient breast tissues.\nRESULTS: Septin9 DNA methylation was more frequent in breast cancer tissues than \nin non-breast cancer tissues, but was not significantly correlated with any \nrelevant breast cancer patient clinicopathological characteristic. Septin9 \nmethylation rates were higher in patients with recurrence or metastasis. Septin9 \nmethylation, tumor size, lymph node status, and progesterone receptor (PR) \nexpression could influence prognosis. Septin9 methylation was significantly \nassociated with worse disease-free survival in breast cancer patients, with \nreceiver operating characteristic curve analysis indicating that it had good \nprognostic ability, with an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.719. The AUC \nvalues increased when Septin9 methylation was combined with tumor size, lymph \nnode status, and PR to predict prognosis.\nCONCLUSIONS: Septin9 DNA methylation was an independent predictors of breast \ncancer prognostic risk.

Children \ndiagnosed with BWS have increased risk for WT. The aim of this study is to \nidentify the molecular signaling signatures in BWS driving these tumors.\nMETHODS: We performed whole exome sequencing, methylation array analysis, and \ngene expression analysis on BWS-WT samples. Our data were compared to publicly \navailable nonBWS data. We categorized WT from BWS and nonBWS patients by \nassessment of 11p15 methylation status and defined 5 groups- control kidney, \nBWS-nontumor kidney, BWS-WT, normal-11p15 nonBWS-WT, altered-11p15 nonBWS-WT.\nRESULTS: BWS-WT samples showed single nucleotide variants in BCORL1, ASXL1, ATM \nand AXL but absence of recurrent gene mutations associated with sporadic WT. We \ndefined a narrow methylation range stratifying nonBWS-WT samples. BWS-WT and \naltered-11p15 nonBWS-WT showed enrichment of common and unique molecular \nsignatures based on global differential methylation and gene expression \nanalysis. CTNNB1 overexpression and broad range of interactions were seen in the \nBWS-WT interactome study.\nCONCLUSION: While WT predisposition in BWS is well-established, as are 11p15 \nalterations in nonBWS-WT, this study focused on stratifying tumor genomics by \n11p15 status. Further investigation of our findings may identify novel \ntherapeutic targets in WT oncogenesis.\n\n© 2023.

We conducted a case-control study \nnested in a three-arm randomized clinical pragmatic trial (ASCUS-COL trial) to \nevaluate the risk of CIN3+ associated with methylation levels according to serum \nfolate concentrations.\nMETHODS: Cases (n = 155) were women with histologically confirmed CIN2+ (113 \nCIN2, 38 CIN3, and 4 SCC) and controls were age and follow-up time at \ndiagnosis-matched women with histologically confirmed ≤ CIN1 (n = 155), selected \nfrom the 1122 hrHPV + women of this trial. The concentrations of serum folate \nwere determined by the radioimmunoassay SimulTRAC-SNB-VitaminB12/Folate-RIAKit \nand the methylation levels by the S5 classifier. Stepwise logistic regression \nmodels were used to estimate the association between folate or methylation \nlevels and CIN2+ or CIN3+. The joint effect of folate levels and methylation on \nthe risk of CIN3+ was estimated using combinations of categorical \nstratifications.\nRESULTS: Folate levels were significantly lower in women with CIN3+ than in \nother diagnostic groups (p = 0.019). The risk of CIN3+ was eight times higher \n(OR 8.9, 95% CI 3.4-24.9) in women with folate deficiency and high methylation \nlevels than in women with normal folate and high methylation levels (OR 1.4, 95% \nCI 0.4-4.6).\nCONCLUSION: High methylation and deficient folate independently increased the \nrisk of CIN3+ while deficient folate combined with high methylation was \nassociated with a substantially elevated risk of CIN3+.\n\n© 2023.

We aimed to characterize \nthe serum methylome of the serrated pathway and to evaluate circulating \ncell-free DNA (cfDNA) methylomes as a potential source of biomarkers for the \nnon-invasive detection of serrated lesions. We collected serum samples from \nindividuals with serrated adenocarcinoma (SAC), traditional serrated adenomas, \nsessile serrated lesions, hyperplastic polyps and individuals with no colorectal \nfindings. First, we quantified cfDNA methylation with the MethylationEPIC array. \nThen, we compared the methylation profiles with tissue and serum datasets. \nFinally, we evaluated the utility of serum cfDNA methylation biomarkers. We \nidentified a differential methylation profile able to distinguish high-risk \nserrated lesions from no serrated neoplasia, showing concordance with tissue \nmethylation from SAC and sessile serrated lesions. Serum methylation profiles \nare pathway-specific, clearly separating serrated lesions from conventional \nadenomas. The combination of ninjurin 2 (NINJ2) and glutamate-rich 1 (ERICH1) \nmethylation discriminated high-risk serrated lesions and SAC with 91.4% \nsensitivity (64.4% specificity), while zinc finger protein 718 (ZNF718) \nmethylation reported 100% sensitivity for the detection of SAC (96% \nspecificity). This is the first study exploring the serum methylome of serrated \nlesions. Differential methylation of cfDNA can be used for the non-invasive \ndetection of colorectal serrated lesions.\n\n© 2023 The Authors.

In the uterine corpus, SMARCA4 / BRG1 deficiency is \nassociated with a novel class of undifferentiated uterine sarcomas, \ncharacterized by younger age onset, rhabdoid histology, focal phyllodiform \narchitecture, high-risk pathologic findings, and dismal prognosis. Herein, we \nreport a case of a 34-year-old Asian woman with a SMARCA4 / BRG1 -deficient \nuterine tumor fulfilling the clinicopathologic features of an undifferentiated \nuterine sarcoma. However, the tumor exhibited several unique features that have \nnot been previously emphasized, including (1) conspicuous phyllodiform \narchitecture recapitulating conventional adenosarcoma, (2) rhabdoid tumor cells \nforming cords and keratin-positive cohesive epithelial islands, and (3) \ncooccurrence with a spatially distinct and discrete endometrial complex atypical \nhyperplasia from the rest of the proliferation. By immunohistochemistry, the \ntumor cells were diffusely positive for synaptophysin, whereas BRG1 was lost. \nPertinent molecular findings included frameshift mutations in the SMARCA4 gene, \nmutations in histone modification and chromatin remodeling genes, including \nKMT2C , ARID1B , KAT6A , and NCOR1 , and mutations in Wnt signaling involving \nAPC and CTNNB1 . Copy number gain in MDM2 and CDK4 were also identified. The \ntumor mutation burden was intermediate (6.8/MB) and it was microsatellite \nstable. On balance, our case exhibited morphologic and molecular features that \noverlap with (1) an undifferentiated uterine sarcoma, (2) an adenosarcoma with \nsarcomatous overgrowth, and (3) a mixed adenosarcoma and undifferentiated \nendometrial carcinoma. These hybrid features further expand the \nmolecular-morphologic spectrum of SMARCA4 / BRG1 -deficient uterine neoplasms.\n\nCopyright © 2023 The Author(s).

This limits scientific discovery in populations that are \nadmixed or of mixed race/ethnicity as they cannot be classified based on \nhistorical race/ethnicity boxes or genetic ancestry cutoffs.\nMETHODS: We used The Cancer Genome Atlas cohort and focused on genetically \nadmixed patients that had less than 90% European, African, Asian, or Native \nAmerican ancestry.\nRESULTS: Genetically admixed patients with breast cancer exhibited improved \n10-year overall survival relative to those with >90% European ancestry. Within \nthe luminal A subtype, patients with lower African ancestry had longer 10-year \noverall survival compared to those with higher African ancestry. The correlation \nof genetic ancestry with gene expression and DNA methylation in the admixed \ncohort revealed novel ancestry-specific intrinsic PAM50 subtype patterns. In \nluminal A tumors, genetic ancestry was correlated with both the expression and \nmethylation of signaling genes, while in basal-like tumors, genetic ancestry was \ncorrelated with stemness genes. In addition, we took a machine-learning approach \nto estimate genetic ancestry from gene expression or DNA methylation and were \nable to accurately calculate ancestry values from a reduced set of 10 genes or \n50 methylation sites that were specific for each molecular subtype.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that incremental changes in genetic ancestry \npercentages result in ancestry-specific molecular differences even between \nwell-established PAM50 subtypes which may influence disparities in breast cancer \nsurvival outcomes. Accounting for incremental changes in ancestry will be \nimportant in future research, prognostication, and risk stratification, \nparticularly in ancestrally diverse populations.\n\nCopyright © 2023 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

We observed galectin-7 up-regulation upon EHMT2 \ninhibition, which converted a \"cold\" MSS tumor environment into a \nT-cell-inflamed one.

Electronic address: amlan.dbs@presiuniv.ac.in.\n\nThe role of epigenetic alteration in prostate cancer pathogenesis was reported. \nWe aimed to analyze dysregulation of DNA methylase (DNA methyl transferase/DNMT) \nand demethylase (ten eleven translocase/TET) and the associated interplay \nbetween them during prostate tumorigenesis. Promoter methylation and RNA/protein \nexpression of selected DNMT and TETs were analysed in normal prostate, benign \nprostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and prostate cancer (PCa). Genomic \n5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) level was detected and correlated with DNMT and \nTET proteins. Clinicopathological association of molecular data was done. Our \ndata revealed a very low frequency of promoter methylation for DNMT1 (5-3% and \nhigh frequency for TET1 (22-38%), TET2 (68-90 %), and TET3 (43-32 %) in BPH and \nPCa. The promoter methylation of DNMT1 (p = 0.019) showed a significantly \ndecreasing trend, while that of TET1 (p = 0.0005) and TET2 (p < 0.0001) showed \nan increasing trend from normal prostate to BPH to PCa, indicating their \nepigenetic dysregulation during prostate tumorigenesis. RNA/protein \noverexpression of DNMT1 and reduced expression of TET1 and TET2 in PCa compared \nto BPH were associated with the promoter methylation status of genes. The 5hmC \nlevel was significantly lower in PCa than in BPH and correlated negatively with \nDNMT1 but positively with TET1 and TET2 proteins, suggesting dysregulation of \nDNA methylase and de-methylase activities during prostate tumorigenesis. Lastly, \ntumors having methylated TET1 and TET2 promoters showed advanced \nclinicopathological features (a higher PSA level/Gleason score) and increased \nrisk of bone metastasis. In conclusion, DNMT1 upregulation and epigenetic \nsilencing of TET1 and TET2 was seen during PCa development. TET1 and TET2 \npromoter methylation has prognostic importance.\n\nCopyright © 2023 Elsevier GmbH.

Here, we identified m6 \nA-SNPs and examined the association of these m6 A-SNPs with lung cancer risk in \n13,793 lung cancer cases and 14,027 controls. In silico functional annotation \nwas used to identify causal m6 A-SNPs and target genes.

In vitro assays were performed to \nvalidate the potential role of the target gene in lung cancer. A total of 8794 \nm6 A-SNPs were detected, among which 397 SNPs in nine susceptibility loci were \nassociated with lung cancer risk, including six novel loci. Bioinformatics \nanalyses indicated that rs1321328 in 6q21 was located around the m6 A \nmodification site of AK9 and significantly reduced AK9 expression (β = -0.15, \np = 2.78 × 10-8 ). Moreover, AK9 was significantly downregulated in lung cancer \ntissues than that in adjacent normal tissues of samples from the Cancer Genome \nAtlas and Nanjing Lung Cancer Cohort. MeRIP-qPCR assay suggested that C allele \nof rs1321328 could significantly decrease the m6 A modification level of AK9 \ncompared with G allele.

Our previous findings indicate that Ni alters \ngene expression through epigenetic regulation, specifically impacting E-cadherin \nand angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4), involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition \nand migration. GST-M2, a member of the glutathione S-transferase (GST) enzyme \nfamily, plays a crucial role in cellular defense against oxidative damage and \nhas been increasingly associated with cancer. GST-M2 overexpression inhibits \nlung cancer invasion and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Hypermethylation of \nits promoter in cancer cells reduces gene expression, correlating with poor \nprognosis in non-small-cell lung cancer patients. The impact of Ni on GST-M2 \nremains unclear. We will investigate whether nickel exerts regulatory effects on \nGST-M2 through epigenetic modifications. Additionally, metformin, an \nantidiabetic drug, is being studied as a chemopreventive agent against \nnickel-induced damage. Our findings indicate that nickel chloride (NiCl2 ) \nexposure, both short-term and long-term, represses GST-M2 expression. However, \nthe expression can be restored by demethylation agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine and \nmetformin. NiCl2 promotes hypermethylation of the GST-M2 promoter, as confirmed \nby methylation-specific PCR and bisulfite sequencing. Additionally, NiCl2 also \ninfluences histone acetylation, and metformin counteracts the suppressive effect \nof NiCl2 on histone H3 expression. Metformin reestablishes the binding of \nspecificity protein 1 to the GST-M2 promoter, which is otherwise disrupted by \nNiCl2 . These findings elucidate the mechanism by which Ni reduces GST-M2 \nexpression and transcriptional activity, potentially contributing to Ni-induced \nlung carcinogenesis.\n\n© 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.\n\nDOI: 10.1002/tox.24055\nPMID: 38050843 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

However, uncertainty remains about the identity of genomic CpGs that \nare sensitive to arsenic exposure, in utero or otherwise. Here we identified a \nhigh confidence set of CpG sites whose methylation is sensitive to in utero \narsenic exposure. To do so, we analyzed methylation of infant CpGs as a function \nof maternal urinary arsenic in cord blood and placenta from geographically and \nancestrally distinct human populations. Independent analyses of these distinct \npopulations were followed by combination of results across sexes and \npopulations/tissue types. Following these analyses, we concluded that both sex \nand tissue type are important drivers of heterogeneity in methylation response \nat several CpGs. We also identified 17 high confidence CpGs that were \nhypermethylated across sex, tissue type and population; 11 of these were located \nwithin protein coding genes. This pattern is consistent with hypotheses that \narsenic increases cancer risk by inducing the hypermethylation of genic regions. \nThis study represents an opportunity to understand consistent, reproducible \npatterns of epigenomic responses after in utero arsenic exposure and may aid \ntowards novel biomarkers or signatures of arsenic exposure. Identifying \narsenic-responsive sites can also contribute to our understanding of the \nbiological mechanisms by which arsenic exposure can affect biological function \nand increase risk of cancer and other age-related diseases.\n\nCopyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

DNA \nmethylation, a common epigenetic modification, is well-established to play a key \nrole in cancer progression. We suspected whether DNA methylation could be used \nas biomarkers for EC prognosis.\nMETHODS: In the present study, we analyzed bulk RNA-sequencing data from 544 EC \npatients and DNA methylation data from 430 EC patients in the TCGA-UCEC cohort. \nWe applied weighted correlation network analysis to select a key gene set \nassociated with panoptosis. We conducted correlation analysis between \ntranscriptomic data of the selected key genes and DNA methylation data to \nidentify valuable DNA methylation sites. These sites were further screened by \nCox regression and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator analysis. \nImmune microenvironment differences between high-risk and low-risk groups were \nassessed using single-sample gene set enrichment analysi, xCell and MCPcounter \nalgorithms.\nRESULTS: Our results identified five DNA methylation sites (cg03906681, \ncg04549977, cg06029846, cg10043253 and cg15658376) with significant prognostic \nvalue in EC. We constructed a prognostic model using these sites, demonstrating \nsatisfactory predictive performance. The low-risk group showed higher immune \ncell infiltration. Notably, methylation of site cg03906681 was negatively \nrelated to CD8 T cell infiltration, whereas cg04549977 exhibited positive \ncorrelations with immune infiltration, particularly in macrophages, activated B \ncells, dendritic cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. PD0325901_1060 was \nstrongly correlated with risk scores, indicating a potential therapeutic \nresponse for high-risk EC patients.\nCONCLUSION: We have developed a robust DNA methylation-based prognostic model \nfor EC, which holds promise for improving prognosis prediction and personalized \ntreatment approaches. These findings may contribute to better management of EC \npatients, particularly in identifying those at higher risk who may benefit from \ntailored interventions.\n\n© 2023 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\n\nDOI: 10.1002/jgm.3638\nPMID: 38011892 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Cr(VI) has been \nconsidered as a genotoxic carcinogen, but accumulating evidence indicates that \nCr(VI) also causes various epigenetic toxic effects that play important roles in \nCr(VI) carcinogenesis. However, it is not clear how Cr(VI)-caused epigenetic \ndysregulations contributes to Cr(VI) carcinogenesis. This study investigates \nwhether Cr(VI) epigenetic toxic effect has an impact on its genotoxic effect. It \nwas found that chronic low dose of Cr(VI) exposure time-dependently \ndown-regulates the expression of a critical DNA damage repair protein \nO6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), leading to the increases of the \nlevels of the highly mutagenic and carcinogenic DNA lesion O6-methylguanine \n(O6-MeG) in human bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells. Moreover, the levels of \nMGMT and O6-MeG in chronic Cr(VI) exposure-caused human lung cancer tissues are \nalso significantly lower and higher than that in the adjacent normal lung \ntissues, respectively. It was further determined that chronic low dose of Cr(VI) \nexposure-transformed BEAS-2B cells display impaired DNA damage repair capacity \nand a high sensitivity to the toxicity of the alkylating chemotherapeutic drug \nTemozolomide. In contrast, stably overexpressing MGMT in parental BEAS-2B cells \nreverses chronic low dose of Cr(VI) exposure-caused DNA damage repair deficiency \nand significantly reduces cell transformation by Cr(VI). Further mechanistical \nstudies revealed that chronic low dose of Cr(VI) exposure down-regulates MGMT \nexpression through epigenetic mechanisms by increasing DNA methylation and \nhistone H3 repressive modifications. Taken together, these findings suggest that \nepigenetic down-regulation of a crucial DNA damage repair protein MGMT \ncontributes significantly to the genotoxic effect and cell transformation caused \nby chronic low dose of Cr(VI) exposure.\n\nCopyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

The mechanisms behind the development of fatty \nliver in children are not yet known. We examined the role of the C/EBPα-p300 \npathway in the development of maternal obesity-associated fatty liver phenotype \nin offspring.\nMETHODS: Because the ability of C/EBPα to promote fatty liver phenotype is \nenhanced by CDK4-mediated phosphorylation of C/EBPα at Ser193 and subsequent \nformation of C/EBPα-p300 complexes, we used wild-type (WT) and C/EBPα-S193D and \nC/EBPα-S193A mutant mice to study the effects of maternal high-fat diet (HFD) on \nthe liver health of offspring. The females of these mouse lines were fed an HFD \nbefore mating, and the pups were further subjected to either an HFD or a normal \ndiet for 12 weeks.\nRESULTS: WT female mice on the HFD before and during pregnancy and their \nsubsequent offspring on the HFD had severe fatty liver, fibrosis, and an \nincreased rate of liver proliferation. However, the HFD in C/EBPα-S193A mice did \nnot cause development of these disorders. In HFD-HFD treated WT mice, C/EBPα is \nphosphorylated at Ser193 and forms complexes with p300, which activate \nexpression of genes involved in development of fatty liver, fibrosis, and \nproliferation. However, S193A-C/EBPα mice do not have complexes of C/EBPα-S193A \nwith p300, leading to a lack of activation of genes of fatty liver, fibrosis, \nand proliferation. The mutant C/EBPα-S193D mice have accelerated cdk4-dependent \npathway and have developed steatosis at early stages.\nCONCLUSIONS: These studies identified the epigenetic cause of obese \npregnancy-associated liver diseases and suggest a potential therapy based on \ninhibition of cdk4-ph-S193-C/EBPα-p300 pathway.\n\nCopyright © 2024 The Authors.

However, DNA methylation is highly \nprevalent across a wide range of tumors, suggesting its potential in \noncogenesis. Here, we aimed to interrogate the role of nine epigenetic \nalterations as diagnostic and prognostic markers in BLCA.\nMETHODS: DNA methylation, gene expression, and clinicopathological information \nwere retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas data portal. Methylation values and \ngene expression were assessed to determine their association with normal and \nmalignant tissue. Additionally, we studied the association between methylation \nvalues and clinicopathological variables. For the prognostic model, Kaplan-Meier \nSurvival curves were generated. Lastly, univariate and multivariate analysis \nwere performed to evaluate the simultaneous impact of methylation and \nclinicopathological variables on the risk of tumor progression and survival.\nRESULTS: Nine CpG sites' methylation β -values involved in our study \ndemonstrated different methylation signatures between normal and malignant \nurothelium. Hypermethylated CpGs were overrepresented in tumor tissue \n(p < 0.0001). Opposingly, 4 CpG sites showed lower methylation values in tumor \nsamples (p < 0.0001).

However, the associations between GAA and muscle mass \nand function are unknown.\nMETHODS: We estimated measures of GAA in 1 118 Black and White participants from \nthe Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study at exam \nyears (Y) 15 (2000-2001) and 20 (2005-2006). Abdominal muscle composition was \nmeasured using CT scans at the Y25 (2010-2011) visit. We used multivariate \nregression models to examine associations of GAA estimates with muscle imaging \nmeasurements.\nRESULTS: In the CARDIA study, each 1-year higher GAA was associated with an \naverage 1.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.6%, 1.5%) higher intermuscular \nadipose tissue (IMAT) volume for abdominal muscles. Each 1-year higher GAA was \nassociated with an average -0.089 Hounsfield unit (HU; 95% CI: -0.146, -0.032) \nlower lean muscle attenuation and an average -0.049 HU (95% CI: -0.092, -0.007) \nlower IMAT attenuation for abdominal muscles. Stratified analyses showed that \nGAA was more strongly associated with higher abdominal muscle IMAT volume in \nfemales and significantly associated with lower lean muscle attenuation for \nWhite participants only.\nCONCLUSIONS: Higher GAA is associated with higher abdominal muscle IMAT volume \nand lower lean muscle attenuation in a midlife population.\n\n© The Author(s) 2023.

In this study, we \naimed to develop and validate a diagnostic model for PTC based on DNA \nmethylation markers. A total of 142 thyroid nodule tissue samples containing 84 \ncases of PTC and 58 cases of thyroid adenoma (TA) were collected for reduced \nrepresentation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) and subsequent analysis. The \ndiagnostic model was constructed by the logistic regression (LR) method followed \nby 5-cross validation and based on 94 tissue methylation haplotype block (MHB) \nmarkers. The model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic \ncurve (AUROC) of 0.974 (95% CI, 0.964-0.981) on 108 training samples and 0.917 \n(95% CI, 0.864-0.973) on 27 independent testing samples. The diagnostic model \nscores showed significantly high in males (P = 0.0016), age ≤ 45 years \n(P = 0.026), high body mass index (BMI) (P = 0.040), lymph node metastasis \n(P = 0.00052) and larger nodules (P = 0.0017) in the PTC group, and the risk \nscore of this diagnostic model showed significantly high in recurrent PTC group \n(P = 0.0005). These results suggest that the diagnostic model can be expected to \nbe a powerful tool for PTC diagnosis and there are more potential clinical \napplications of methylation markers to be excavated.\n\nCopyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

Electronic address: kamaleshwar.singh@ttu.edu.\n\nDespite the progress made in cancer diagnosis and treatment, breast cancer \nremains the second leading cause of cancer-related death among the women. \nExposure to elevated levels of endogenous estrogen or environmental estrogenic \nchemicals is an important risk factor for breast cancer. Estrogen metabolites \nand ROS generated during estrogen metabolism are known to play a critical role \nin estrogen carcinogenesis. However, the molecular mechanisms through which \nestrogen-induced ROS regulate gene expression is not clear. Epigenetic changes \nof DNA methylation and histone modifications are known to regulate genes \nexpression. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate whether \nestrogen-induced ROS, through aberrant expression of epigenetic regulatory genes \nand epigenetic reprogramming, causes growth of breast cancer cells. Estrogen \nresponsive MCF-7 and T47D human breast cancer cells were exposed to natural \nestrogen 17 beta-estradiol (E2) and synthetic estrogen Diethylstilbestrol (DES) \nboth alone and in combination with antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine. Effects of \nNAC-mediated scavenging of estrogen-induced ROS on cell growth, gene expression, \nand histone modifications were measured. The result of MTT and cell cycle \nanalysis revealed significant abrogation of E2 and DES-induced growth by \nscavenging ROS through NAC. E2 and DES caused significant changes in expression \nof epigenetic regulatory genes for DNA methylation and histone modifications as \nwell as changes in both gene activating and repressive marks in the Histone H3. \nNAC restored the expression of epigenetic regulatory genes and changes in \nhistone marks. Novel findings of this study suggest that estrogen can induce \ngrowth of breast cancer cells through ROS-dependent regulation of epigenetic \nregulatory genes and epigenetic reprogramming of histone marks.\n\nCopyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we performed whole-exome, RNA, and \nDNA-methylation sequencing of IDC-P, concurrent invasive high-grade PAC lesions, \nand adjacent normal prostate tissues isolated from 22 radical prostatectomy \nspecimens. Three evolutionary patterns of concurrent IDC-P and PAC were \nidentified: early divergent, late divergent, and clonally distant. In contrast \nto those with a late divergent evolutionary pattern, tumors with clonally \ndistant and early divergent evolutionary patterns showed higher genomic, \nepigenomic, transcriptional, and pathologic heterogeneity between IDC-P and PAC. \nCompared with coexisting PAC, IDC-P displayed increased expression of adverse \nprognosis-associated genes. Survival analysis based on an independent cohort of \n505 patients with metastatic prostate cancer revealed that IDC-P carriers with \nlower risk International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade 1-4 \nadenocarcinoma displayed a castration-resistant free survival as poor as those \nwith the highest risk ISUP grade 5 tumors that lacked concurrent IDC-P. \nFurthermore, IDC-P exhibited robust cell-cycle progression and androgen receptor \nactivities, characterized by an enrichment of cellular proliferation-associated \nmaster regulators and genes involved in intratumoral androgen biosynthesis. \nOverall, this study provides a molecular groundwork for the aggressive behavior \nof IDC-P and could help identify potential strategies to improve treatment of \nIDC-P.\nSIGNIFICANCE: The genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic characterization of \nconcurrent intraductal carcinoma and adenocarcinoma of the prostate deepens the \nbiological understanding of this lethal disease and provides a genetic basis for \ndeveloping targeted therapies.\n\n©2023 American Association for Cancer Research.\n\nDOI: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-23-1176\nPMID: 37847513 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

In non-neoplastic mucosa, methylation of H. pylori infection associated \ngenes was higher in patients with GC than those without. In primary GC tissues, \nhigher methylation of H. pylori infection associated genes correlated with \nCIMP-positive and its related features, such as MLH1 methylated cases. On the \nother hand, GC with lower methylation of these genes presented aggressive \nclinicopathological features including undifferentiated histopathology, advanced \nstage at diagnosis. H. pylori infection associated DNA methylation is correlated \nwith CIMP, specific molecular and clinicopathological features in GC, supporting \nits utility as promising biomarker in this tumor type.\n\n© 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.\n\nDOI: 10.1002/mc.23650\nPMID: 37846801 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

However, it is still controversial whether IM itself is \nprecancerous or paracancerous. Here, we aimed to explore the precancerous nature \nof IM by analysing epigenetic alterations.\nDESIGN: Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis was conducted by EPIC BeadArray \nusing IM crypts isolated by Alcian blue staining. Chromatin immunoprecipitation \nsequencing for H3K27ac and single-cell assay for transposase-accessible \nchromatin by sequencing were conducted using IM mucosa. NOS2 was induced using \nTet-on gene expression system in normal cells.\nRESULTS: IM crypts had a methylation profile unique from non-IM crypts, showing \nextensive DNA hypermethylation in promoter CpG islands, including those of \ntumour-suppressor genes. Also, the IM-specific methylation profile, namely \nepigenetic footprint, was present in a fraction of gastric cancers with a higher \nfrequency than expected, and suggested to be associated with good overall \nsurvival. IM organoids had remarkably high NOS2 expression, and NOS2 induction \nin normal cells led to accelerated induction of aberrant DNA methylation, namely \nepigenetic instability, by increasing DNA methyltransferase activity. IM mucosa \nshowed dynamic enhancer reprogramming, including the regions involved in higher \nNOS2 expression. NOS2 had open chromatin in IM cells but not in gastric cells, \nand IM cells had frequent closed chromatin of tumour-suppressor genes, \nindicating their methylation-silencing. NOS2 expression in IM-derived organoids \nwas upregulated by interleukin-17A, a cytokine secreted by extracellular \nbacterial infection.\nCONCLUSIONS: IM cells were considered to have a precancerous nature potentially \nwith an increased chance of converting into cancer cells, and an accelerated DNA \nmethylation induction due to abnormal NOS2 expression.\n\n© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2024.

As \nmosaic BRCA1meth are believed to occur de novo, their role in family \nbreast/ovarian cancer has not been assessed.\nPATIENTS: Blood-derived DNA from 20 unrelated affected cases from families with \naggregation of breast/ovarian cancer, but with no germline pathogenic variants \nin BRCA1/2, PALB2 or RAD51C/D, were screened by methylation-sensitive \nhigh-resolution melting. CpG analysis was performed by pyrosequencing on blood \nand buccal swab. Two probands carried a pathogenic variant in a \nmoderate-penetrance gene (ATM and BARD1), and 8 of 18 others (44%) carried \nBRCA1meth (vs none of the 20 age-matched controls). Involvement of BRCA1 in \ntumourigenesis in methylated probands was demonstrated in most tested cases by \ndetection of a loss of heterozygosity and a homologous recombination deficiency \nsignature. Among the eight methylated probands, two had relatives with breast \ncancer with detectable BRCA1meth in blood, including one with high methylation \nlevels in two non-tumour tissues.\nCONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of mosaic BRCA1meth in patients with \nbreast/ovarian cancer with affected relatives, as well as this first description \nof a family aggregation of mosaic BRCA1meth, shows how this de novo event can \ncontribute to hereditary breast/ovarian cancer pedigrees.\n\n© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2024.

Electronic address: tmanuck@med.unc.edu.\n\nBACKGROUND: Epigenetic clocks use CpG DNA methylation to estimate biological \nage. Acceleration is associated with cancer, heart disease, and shorter life \nspan. Few studies evaluate DNA methylation age and pregnancy outcomes. \nAgeAccelGrim is a novel epigenetic clock that combines 7 DNA methylation \ncomponents.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine whether maternal biological aging (via \nAgeAccelGrim) is associated with early preterm birth.\nSTUDY DESIGN: A prospective cohort of patients with singleton pregnancies and at \nhigh risk of spontaneous preterm birth delivering at a tertiary university \nhospital were included in this study. Genome-wide CpG methylation was measured \nusing the Illumina EPIC BeadChip (Illumina, Inc, San Diego, CA) from maternal \nblood samples obtained at <28 weeks of gestation. AgeAccelGrim and its 7 DNA \nmethylation components were estimated by the Horvath DNA methylation age online \ntool. Positive values are associated with accelerated biological aging, whereas \nnegative values are associated with slower biological aging relative to each \nsubject's age. The primary outcome was preterm birth at <34 weeks of gestation \n(any indication). The secondary outcomes were preterm birth at <37 and <28 weeks \nof gestation. AgeAccelGrim was analyzed as a continuous variable and in \nquartiles. Exploratory analyses evaluated each of the 7 DNA methylation \ncomponents included in the composite AgeAccelGrim. Data were analyzed by \nchi-square test, t test, rank-sum test, logistic regression (controlling a \npriori for maternal age, cell counts, low socioeconomic status, and gestational \nage at the time of sample collection), and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses. The \nlog-rank test was used to test the equality of the survival functions.\nRESULTS: Overall, 163 patients met the inclusion criteria. Of the patients, 48%, \n39%, and 21% delivered at <37, <34, and <28 weeks of gestation, respectively. \nThe median AgeAccelGrim was -0.35 years (interquartile range, -2.24 to 1.31) for \nthose delivering at term. Those delivering preterm had higher AgeAccelGrim \nvalues that were inversely proportional to delivery gestational age (preterm \nbirth at <37 weeks of gestation: +0.40 years [interquartile range: -1.21 \nto +2.28]; preterm birth at <34 weeks of gestation: +0.51 years [interquartile \nrange: -1.05 to +2.67]; preterm birth at <28 weeks of gestation: +1.05 years \n[interquartile range: -0.72 to +2.72]). Estimated DNA methylation of the 7 \nepigenetic clock component values was increased among those with preterm birth \nat <34 weeks of gestation, although the differences were only significant for \nDNA methylation of plasminogen activation inhibitor 1. In regression models, \nAgeAcccelGrim was associated with an elevated risk of preterm birth with \nincreasing magnitude for increasing severity of preterm birth. For each 1-year \nincrease in the AgeAccelGrim value (ie, each 1-year increase in biological age \ncompared with chronologic age), the adjusted odds of preterm birth were 11% \n(adjusted odds ratio, 1.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.00-1.24), 13% (adjusted \nodds ratio, 1.13; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.26), and 18% (adjusted odds \nratio, 1.18; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.35) higher for preterm birth at \n<37, <34, and <28 weeks of gestation, respectively. Similarly, individuals with \naccelerated biological aging (≥75th percentile AgeAccelGrim) had more than \ndouble the odds of preterm birth at <34 weeks of gestation (adjusted odds ratio, \n2.36; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-5.08) and more than triple the odds of \npreterm birth at <28 weeks of gestation (adjusted odds ratio, 3.89; 95% \nconfidence interval, 1.61-9.38). The adjusted odds ratio for preterm birth at \n<37 weeks of gestation was 1.73 but spanned the null (adjusted odds ratio, 1.73; \n95% confidence interval, 0.81-3.69). In Kaplan-Meier survival analyses, those in \nthe highest AgeAccelGrim quartile delivered the earliest (log-rank P value of \n<.001).\nCONCLUSION: Accelerated biological aging was associated with preterm birth among \nhigh-risk patients. Future research confirming these findings and elucidating \nfactors that slow biological aging may improve birth outcomes.\n\nCopyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we proposed a \nnovel Multi-Omics integrative Deep-learning framework named MODeepHRD for \ndetecting HRD-positive phenotype. MODeepHRD utilizes a convolutional attention \nautoencoder that effectively leverages omics-specific and cross-omics \ncomplementary knowledge learning. We trained MODeepHRD on 351 ovarian cancer \n(OV) patients using transcriptomic, DNA methylation and mutation data, and \nvalidated it in 2133 OV samples of 22 datasets. The predicted HRD-positive \ntumors were significantly associated with improved survival (HR = 0.68; 95% CI, \n0.60-0.77; log-rank p < 0.001 for meta-cohort; HR = 0.5; 95% CI, 0.29-0.86; \nlog-rank p = 0.01 for ICGC-OV cohort) and higher response to platinum-based \nchemotherapy compared to predicted HRD-negative tumors. The translational \npotential of MODeepHRDs was further validated in multicenter breast and \nendometrial cancer cohorts. Furthermore, MODeepHRD outperforms conventional \nmachine-learning methods and other similar task approaches. In conclusion, our \nstudy demonstrates the promising value of deep learning as a solution for HRD \ntesting in the clinical setting. MODeepHRD holds potential clinical \napplicability in guiding patient risk stratification and therapeutic decisions, \nproviding valuable insights for precision oncology and personalized treatment \nstrategies.\n\nDOI: 10.1109/JBHI.2023.3308440\nPMID: 37616142 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

And induction of hypoxia and the tumors \nresponse to it plays an important role in determining the efficacy of \nantiangiogenic therapy while the connection between them remains unclear. Here, \nwe found that lactate accumulated in the tumor environment of CRC and acted as \nsubstrates for histone lactylation, and this process was further induced by \ncellular enhanced glycolysis in hypoxia. We determined that CRC patients \nresistant to bevacizumab treatment presented with elevated levels of histone \nlactylation and inhibition of histone lactylation efficiently suppressed CRC \ntumorigenesis, progression and survival in hypoxia. Histone lactylation promoted \nthe transcription of RUBCNL/Pacer, facilitating autophagosome maturation through \ninteracting with BECN1 (beclin 1) and mediating the recruitment and function of \nthe class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex, which had a crucial role in \nhypoxic cancer cells proliferation and survival. Moreover, combining inhibition \nof histone lactylation and macroautophagy/autophagy with bevacizumab treatment \ndemonstrated remarkable treatment efficacy in bevacizumab-resistance \npatients-derived pre-clinical models. These findings delivered a new exploration \nand important supplement of metabolic reprogramming-epigenetic regulation, and \nprovided a new strategy for improving clinical efficacy of bevacizumab in CRC by \ninhibition of histone lactylation.Abbreviations: 2-DG: 2-deoxy-D-glucose; BECN1: \nbeclin 1; CQ: chloroquine; CRC: colorectal cancer; DMOG: dimethyloxalylglycine; \nH3K18la: histone H3 lysine 18 lactylation; MAP1LC3B/LC3B: microtubule associated \nprotein 1 light chain 3 beta; Nala: sodium lactate; PDO: patient-derived \norgnoid; PDX: patient-derived xenograft; RUBCNL/Pacer: rubicon like autophagy \nenhancer; SQSTM1/p62: sequestosome 1.\n\nDOI: 10.1080/15548627.2023.2249762\nPMCID: PMC10761097\nPMID: 37615625 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: No potential conflict of interest was reported \nby the author(s)."

However, the molecular basis governing this process has \nnot yet been clearly defined. Despite the considerable success of \npoly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) in cancer therapy, the limited \nresponse to PARPi, especially in HCC, has been a bottleneck in its clinical \nimplications. Herein, we investigated the molecular basis of the histone \nmethyltransferase KMT5C (lysine methyltransferase 5C) that governs PARPi \nsensitivity and explored a potential therapeutic strategy for enhancing PARPi \nefficacy.\nAPPROACH AND RESULTS: We identified KMT5C, a trimethyltransferase of H4K20, as a \ntargetable epigenetic factor that promoted liver tumor growth in mouse de novo \nMYC/Trp53-/- and xenograft liver tumor models. Notably, induction of KMT5C by \nenvironmental stress was crucial for DNA repair and HCC cell survival. \nMechanistically, KMT5C interacted with the pivotal component of homologous \nrecombination repair, RAD51, and promoted RAD51/RAD54 complex formation, which \nwas essential for the activation of dsDNA breaks repair. This effect depended on \nthe methyltransferase activity of KMT5C. We further demonstrated that the \nfunction of KMT5C in promoting HCC progression was dependent on RAD51. \nImportantly, either a pharmacological inhibitor (A196) or genetic inhibition of \nKMT5C sensitized liver cancer cells to PARPi.\nCONCLUSIONS: KMT5C played a vital role in promoting liver cancer progression by \nactivating the DNA repair response. Our results revealed a novel therapeutic \napproach using the KMT5C inhibitor A196, concurrent with olaparib, as a \npotential HCC therapy.\n\nCopyright © 2023 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.\n\nDOI: 10.1097/HEP.0000000000000559\nPMID: 37556368 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Recent epigenome-wide association studies have uncovered \npervasive dysregulation of DNA methylation in schizophrenia; however, clinical \nfeatures of the disorder that account for a large proportion of phenotypic \nvariability are relatively underexplored.\nMETHODS: We comprehensively analyzed patterns of DNA methylation in a cohort of \n381 individuals with schizophrenia from the deeply phenotyped Australian \nSchizophrenia Research Bank. Epigenetic changes were investigated in association \nwith cognitive status, age of onset, treatment resistance, Global Assessment of \nFunctioning scores, and common variant polygenic risk scores for schizophrenia. \nWe subsequently explored alterations within genes previously associated with \npsychiatric illness, phenome-wide epigenetic covariance, and epigenetic scores.\nRESULTS: Epigenome-wide association studies of the 5 primary traits identified \n662 suggestively significant (p < 6.72 × 10-5) differentially methylated probes, \nwith a further 432 revealed after controlling for schizophrenia polygenic risk \non the remaining 4 traits. Interestingly, we uncovered many probes within genes \nassociated with a variety of psychiatric conditions as well as significant \nepigenetic covariance with phenotypes and exposures including acute myocardial \ninfarction, C-reactive protein, and lung cancer. Epigenetic scores for \ntreatment-resistant schizophrenia strikingly exhibited association with \nclozapine administration, while epigenetic proxies of plasma protein expression, \nsuch as CCL17, MMP10, and PRG2, were associated with several features of \nschizophrenia.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings collectively provide novel evidence suggesting that \nseveral features of schizophrenia are associated with alteration of DNA \nmethylation, which may contribute to interindividual phenotypic variation in \naffected individuals.\n\nCopyright © 2023 Society of Biological Psychiatry.
