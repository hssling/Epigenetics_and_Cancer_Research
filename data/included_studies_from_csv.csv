BackgroundMelanoma represents one of the most aggressive skin cancers, 
responsible for over 75% of skin cancer-related deaths despite comprising only 
5% of cases. Despite therapeutic advances, patient responses remain variable and 
unpredicv. The Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule (SLAM) family regulates 
immune cell communication, with SLAMF8 being predominantly expressed on myeloid 
cells. However, SLAMF8's specific role in melanoma pathogenesis remains largely 
unexplored.MethodsIn this retrospective integrative study, we systematically 
investigated SLAMF8's role in melanoma through multi-omics analyses using TIMER, 
GEPIA, and UALCAN databases, following the STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting 
of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) guidelines for observational data 
reporting. Functional studies were conducted in A-375 and SK-MEL-28 melanoma 
cell lines using siRNA-mediated knockdown, followed by migration, invasion, and 
proliferation assays. DNA methylation patterns were analyzed via the SMART 
database, while mutation profiles were examined using cBioPortal and COSMIC. 
Immune infiltration analysis was performed through TIMER, and pathway 
associations were investigated using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis and 
protein-protein interaction networks. Finally, two-sample Mendelian 
Randomization analysis assessed the causal relationship between SLAMF8 
expression and melanoma susceptibility.ResultsSLAMF8 expression was 
significantly higher in metastatic melanoma compared to primary tumors, with 
expression patterns varying across disease stages and between sexes. Higher 
SLAMF8 expression correlated with improved disease-free and overall survival. 
Functional studies demonstrated that SLAMF8 knockdown significantly enhanced 
melanoma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. DNA methylation analysis 
revealed significant negative correlations between methylation at specific CpG 
sites and SLAMF8 expression, with hypermethylation associated with worse 
survival outcomes. Mutation analysis identified alterations in 10.21% of 
melanoma patients. Immune infiltration studies demonstrated strong correlations 
between SLAMF8 expression and enhanced immune cell presence. GSEA linked SLAMF8 
to critical immune pathways including allograft rejection, inflammatory 
response, and interferon signaling. Mendelian Randomization analysis established 
a protective causal relationship between SLAMF8 and melanoma risk (OR = 0.39, 
95% CI = 0.21-0.74, p = 3.34e-03).ConclusionOur study demonstrates that SLAMF8 
plays a critical role in melanoma by suppressing tumor progression and 
modulating the immune microenvironment. Elevated SLAMF8 expression in metastatic 
melanoma is associated with improved patient survival, suggesting its utility as 
a prognostic biomarker. Furthermore, its tumor-suppressive effects and 
immune-regulatory functions highlight SLAMF8 as a promising therapeutic target 
for melanoma treatment strategies.

BACKGROUND: While DNA methylation profiling from peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells (PBMCs) has demonstrated utility in cancer risk prediction, notably for 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), its prognostic value for survival 
stratification in Chinese lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients remains 
unestablished. This study addresses whether PBMC-derived methylation signatures 
can discriminate clinical outcomes in EGFR-mutation LUAD subgroups.
METHODS: We performed genome-wide methylation analysis of PBMCs from LUAD 
patients using the Infinium Methylation EPIC 850 K array. Clinical 
characteristics were associated with overall survival (OS) through Cox 
regression. Prognostic differentially methylated positions (DMPs) were 
identified via Lasso regression, followed by the construction of risk-score 
models. Functional enrichment (KEGG/GO) and tissue microarray-based 
immunohistochemistry (IHC) for FKBP4 expression (n = 90 LUAD samples) were 
conducted. Analyses were conducted in R 4.4.1 with curated Bioconductor 
packages.
RESULTS: In the retrospective cohort of 174 Chinese LUAD patients (April 
2014-September 2019), PBMC analysis of 128 cases revealed 12 hypomethylated DMPs 
were associated with OS. EGFR-mutant patients (n = 66) showed 325 significant 
DMPs (|Δβ|≥ 0.06, P ≤ 0.01), with four DMPs (cg05802998, cg19313959, cg00685115, 
cg15224444) independently predicting OS. The cg19313959 located in the TSS1500 
region of FKBP4 gene (Δβ = 0.21) demonstrated the strongest methylation shift. 
Reduced FKBP4 protein expression was associated with improved survival 
(HR = 0.42, 95%CI 0.24-0.72). In EGFR-wildtype patients (n = 51), three 
prognostic DMPs emerged from 2,531 candidates. EGFR mutation-specific prognostic 
scoring models were established successfully, while pathway analyses revealed 
divergent biological processes between EGFR subgroups.
CONCLUSION: In this epigenome-wide study based on PBMCs in Chinese patients with 
LUAD, methylation signatures dependent on EGFR mutations and predictive of 
survival were identified.

BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies have shown a small but significantly 
increased risk of leukemia in children conceived by in vitro fertilization. 
Atypical DNA methylation patterns observed in pediatric cancers are suspected to 
occur in utero, and it is known that periconceptional conditions linked to 
assisted reproductive technologies (ART) are responsible for DNA methylation 
modifications.
RESULTS: Using databases and systematic literature screens, we derived a list of 
cancer/leukemia genes (n = 1246 and n = 532 genes, respectively, corresponding 
to 1466 individual genes) and of differentially methylated genes (DMG) in 
leukemia (n = 2642) and pre-leukemia (n = 381). These lists were 
cross-referenced with DMG (n = 93) curated from 18 ART Epigenome-Wide 
Association Studies (EWAS) (2369 samples). Among the ART DMG, more than 
one-third (n = 33) were leukemia, and six were pre-leukemia DMG, all 
representing a significant enrichment. Seven of the enriched genes (NTM, PRSS16, 
SCAND3, SYCP1, TP73, ZNF184, and ISL1-DT) showed concordant methylation between 
ART and leukemia/pre-leukemia. Moreover, five of the ART DMG are known targets 
for somatic/germline alterations in leukemia: ATP10A, CHD2, FBRSL1, FGFR2, and 
SORCS1. The ART DMG were not significantly enriched in cancer genes, supporting 
the hypothesis that ART may not link broadly to any cancer type but rather to 
leukemia.
CONCLUSION: This study indicates that relatively few genes that are known 
targets for somatic/germline mutation in cancer experience DNA methylation 
changes in individuals conceived through ART. By contrast, DNA methylation 
disturbances reported in leukemia represent more than one-third of those 
associated with ART conception, thus raising the question of their role in 
leukemia risk in ART-conceived individuals. Among them, a few critical genes 
such as TP73, a tumor suppressor, were shown to be targeted for 
hypermethylation, both in ART and leukemia, warranting further investigation.

BACKGROUND: Endocrine science remains underrepresented in European Union 
research programs despite the fundamental role of hormone health in human 
wellbeing. Analysis of the CORDIS database reveals a persistent gap between the 
societal impact of endocrine disorders and their research prioritization. At 
national funding level, endocrine societies report limited or little attention 
of national research funding toward endocrinology. The EndoCompass project-a 
joint initiative between the European Society of Endocrinology and the European 
Society of Paediatric Endocrinology, aimed to identify and promote strategic 
research priorities in endocrine science to address critical hormone-related 
health challenges.
METHODS: Research priorities were established through comprehensive analysis of 
the EU CORDIS database covering the Horizon 2020 framework period (2014-2020). 
Expert consultation in pituitary and neuroendocrine tumor endocrinology was 
conducted to identify key research priorities, followed by broader stakeholder 
engagement including society members and patient advocacy groups.
RESULTS: Research priorities encompass congenital and acquired disorders, tumor 
development and progression, and neuroendocrine neoplasms. Key areas include 
genetic/epigenetic factors, tumor microenvironment, personalized treatment 
approaches, developing preclinical models, and implementing artificial 
intelligence. Special emphasis is placed on aggressive tumors, hypothalamic 
syndromes, and establishing pan-European biobanks and databases.
CONCLUSIONS: This component of the EndoCompass project provides an 
evidence-based roadmap for strategic research investment. This framework 
identifies crucial investigation areas into pituitary-neuroendocrine disease 
pathophysiology, prevention, and treatment strategies, ultimately aimed at 
reducing the burden of these disorders on individuals and society. The findings 
support the broader EndoCompass objective of aligning research funding with 
areas of highest potential impact in endocrine health.

BACKGROUND: The trace elements (TEs) selenium, zinc, copper, manganese, iodine 
and iron are essential micronutrients that support essential metabolic 
functions. Imbalance in their homeostasis might contribute to the pathogenesis 
of major age-related chronic diseases including type 2 diabetes (T2D) and 
cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Emerging evidence suggests that TEs may affect 
health outcomes via epigenetic changes. However, few epigenome-wide association 
studies (EWAS) have explored TE-associated DNA methylation markers and their 
links to chronic disease outcomes.
METHODS: We conducted TE-specific exploratory EWAS using a random subcohort 
(n = 1030) from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition 
(EPIC)-Potsdam cohort. The association between identified CpG sites and incident 
chronic diseases was evaluated using a case-cohort design comprising random 
subcohort participants and incident cases of T2D (n = 654) and CVD (n = 334). 
DNA methylation was measured with the MethylationEPIC BeadChip array. We used 
Prentice-weighted Cox proportional hazards regression models to estimate 
multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) 
for the associations of TE-associated CpG sites with each incident chronic 
disease.
RESULTS: In the copper EWAS, we identified six CpG sites (cg00398673, 
cg03957124, cg05736499, cg07573872, cg11503550, and cg18513344) that were 
significantly associated with serum copper concentrations with a False Discovery 
Rate < 0.05. All associated CpG sites showed lower methylation levels in 
association with higher serum copper levels. Higher methylation levels of 
cg00398673 (HR per SD: 0.74, 95% CI 0.63-0.88), cg03957124 (HR per SD: 0.52, 95% 
CI 0.41-0.66), cg05736499 (HR Q5 vs Q1: 0.25, 95% CI 0.14-0.47), and cg18513344 
(HR Q5 vs Q1: 0.37, 95% CI 0.24-0.57) were associated with decreased risk of 
developing T2D, and higher methylation levels of cg07573872 were associated with 
decreased risk of developing CVD (HR per SD: 0.85, 95% CI 0.72-0.99). We did not 
observe any CpG sites that were significantly associated with other TEs.
CONCLUSIONS: Serum copper levels are inversely associated with a number of CpG 
sites. Methylation levels at these CpG sites were inversely associated with 
developing T2D and CVD. These findings may provide new insights on understanding 
the increased risk of T2D and CVD with elevated blood copper levels.

Although generally unknown, the age of a newly diagnosed tumor encodes valuable 
etiologic and prognostic information. Here, we estimate the age of breast 
cancers, defined as the time from the start of growth to detection, using a 
measure of epigenetic entropy derived from genome-wide methylation arrays. Based 
on an ensemble of neutrally fluctuating CpG (fCpG) sites, this stochastic 
epigenetic clock differs from conventional clocks that measure age-related 
increases in methylation. We show that younger tumors exhibit hallmarks of 
aggressiveness, such as increased proliferation and genomic instability, whereas 
older tumors are characterized by elevated immune infiltration, indicative of 
enhanced immune surveillance. These findings suggest that the clock captures a 
tumor's effective growth rate resulting from the evolutionary-ecological 
competition between intrinsic growth potential and external systemic pressures. 
Because of the clock's ability to differentiate old and stable from young and 
aggressive tumors, it has potential applications in risk stratification of 
early-stage breast cancers and guiding early detection efforts.

Primary prostate cancer presents with multifocal lesions and unpredictable 
clinical behavior, posing significant challenges for effective prognosis. To 
address this, we investigate the epigenomic landscape of prostate tumor biopsies 
from 25 treatment-naïve male patients by analyzing chromatin 
compartmentalization patterns. Our analysis reveals two distinct molecular 
subtypes: one with a Low Degree of Decompartmentalization (LDD) and another with 
a High Degree of Decompartmentalization (HDD). Here we show that the HDD 
subgroup exhibits extensive chromatin reorganization associated with diminished 
oncogenic potential. This subtype shows repression of molecular pathways 
involved in extracellular matrix remodeling and cellular plasticity. From this 
distinction, we derive an 18-gene transcriptional signature capable of 
differentiating HDD from LDD cases. Importantly, we validate the prognostic 
relevance of this signature in multiple independent cohorts totaling over 900 
patients. Our findings suggest that epigenetic-derived signature at the time of 
diagnostic biopsy can offer a powerful tool for risk stratification in prostate 
cancer.

INTRODUCTION: TEA domain transcription factor 4 (TEAD4), a key effector of the 
Hippo signaling pathway, has been increasingly associated with tumorigenesis and 
cancer progression. Despite its recognized role, comprehensive pan-cancer 
analyses of TEAD4 expression patterns, prognostic significance, and therapeutic 
implications remain scarce.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic evaluation of TEAD4 across diverse tumor 
types using publicly available datasets, including TCGA. Analyses included gene 
expression profiling, prognostic correlation, functional enrichment, and drug 
sensitivity assessments. Additionally, in vitro assays were performed to 
validate the functional roles of TEAD4 in cancer cell behavior.
RESULTS: TEAD4 was significantly overexpressed in multiple cancers and 
associated with unfavorable prognosis. Functional enrichment analyses implicated 
TEAD4 in oncogenic processes such as proliferation, metastasis, stemness 
maintenance, and immune regulation. In vitro experiments confirmed that TEAD4 
promotes cancer cell proliferation, migration, and stem cell-like properties, 
while TEAD4 knockdown reversed these phenotypes. TEAD4 expression correlated 
with genomic instability, epigenetic alterations, and remodeling of the tumor 
microenvironment. Drug sensitivity analysis indicated that elevated TEAD4 levels 
were linked to resistance against several chemotherapeutic agents. Furthermore, 
a prognostic model based on TEAD4 target gene expression successfully stratified 
patients by survival risk.
DISCUSSION: Our findings highlight the multifaceted roles of TEAD4 in cancer 
biology, emphasizing its contribution to tumor progression, therapy resistance, 
and patient outcomes. The evidence supports TEAD4 as a promising prognostic 
biomarker and therapeutic target, offering new avenues for translational cancer 
research.

BACKGROUND: Bladder cancer (BC) is the ninth most prevalent cancer globally, 
with approximately 75% of cases classified as non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer 
(NMIBC). Although transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) is the 
standard treatment for NMIBC, there remains a considerable risk of postoperative 
residual tumors. Accurately identifying patients who require repeat 
transurethral resection of bladder tumor (Re-TURBT) remains a significant 
clinical challenge. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exhibits high accuracy in 
detecting residual tumors after TURBT, aiding clinical decision-making. However, 
its relatively low specificity limits its clinical applicability. Urinary 
methylation markers, particularly those associated with H4 cluster protein 6 
(H4C6) and Twist Family BHLH Transcription Factor 1 (TWIST1), have demonstrated 
high sensitivity and specificity in detecting bladder cancer, showing promising 
clinical performance. The combined detection of H4C6 and TWIST1 gene methylation 
provides a more reliable method for identifying residual tumors post-TURBT. 
Integrating the VI-RADS score with urine gene methylation analysis could 
complement each other, improving the accuracy of residual tumor detection and 
enhancing clinical applicability.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the predictive value of 
clinical/pathological factors, urinary H4C6 and TWIST1 gene methylation, and 
their combined performance in identifying postoperative residual tumors in NMIBC 
patients.
METHODS: Morning urine samples from NMIBC patients at Zhongshan City People's 
Hospital (June 2022-August 2024) were analyzed for H4C6 and TWIST1 methylation 
levels. Patients underwent MRI and Re-TURBT. Logistic regression was used to 
identify predictors of residual tumors, and a nomogram was developed. Model 
performance was evaluated using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves 
and decision curve analysis (DCA).
RESULTS: Among the 55 patients included in the study, the area under the ROC 
curve (AUC) for urinary H4C6 methylation was 0.698, whereas TWIST1 methylation 
had an AUC of 0.758. Combined dual-gene methylation yielded an AUC of 0.764. The 
AUC for VI-RADS scoring was 0.888. When dual-gene methylation and hematuria were 
combined with VI-RADS scores, the prediction model achieved an AUC of 0.972. DCA 
demonstrated that the prediction model offers substantial clinical benefit 
across a broad range of threshold probabilities. The combined prediction model 
of dual-gene methylation, hematuria, and VI-RADS scores offers a powerful 
non-invasive method to assist clinicians in identifying high-risk patients with 
residual tumors after TURBT, thereby reducing unnecessary Re-TURBT and improving 
patient management.
CONCLUSION: Urinary H4C6 and TWIST1 gene methylation, along with VI-RADS 
scoring, show high diagnostic performance in predicting residual tumors 
following TURBT in NMIBC patients. A combined prediction model incorporating 
dual-gene methylation, hematuria, and VI-RADS scores achieves superior 
discrimination, excellent calibration, and strong clinical utility.

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) exhibits complex epigenetic dysregulation 
that impacts treatment response and prognosis, yet comprehensive analysis 
linking epigenetic signatures to clinical outcomes remains limited. We 
integrated single-cell RNA sequencing data from 42 NSCLC and 11 normal samples 
with bulk transcriptomics from multiple cohorts (TCGA-NSCLC [n = 993], GSE13213 
[n = 110], GSE42127 [n = 176]). Cell types were annotated using scMayoMap and 
validated through marker gene analysis. Epigenetic patterns across 15 cell types 
were characterized using single-sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA). 
Through weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), we identified key 
epigenetic regulatory modules and their associated genes. We systematically 
evaluated 111 machine learning algorithms to develop an epigenetic-based risk 
stratification model, with Random Survival Forest (RSF) emerging as the optimal 
approach. Experimental validation confirmed significant upregulation of key 
model genes at both mRNA (qRT-PCR: SLC2A1, LAD1, LYPD3; all p < 0.01) and 
protein levels (immunohistochemistry) in tumor tissues compared to adjacent 
normal tissues. Furthermore, functional experiments demonstrated that 
overexpression of LYPD3 significantly promoted NSCLC cell proliferation, 
migration, and invasion in vitro, corroborating computational findings and 
providing strong mechanistic validation of the model. Drug sensitivity analysis 
revealed differential therapeutic vulnerabilities, with high-risk patients 
showing increased sensitivity to EGFR-TKIs, including Gefitinib (p < 0.001). The 
model demonstrated significant prognostic value in kidney chromophobe 
(p = 0.040), kidney clear cell carcinoma (p < 0.001), and cervical squamous cell 
carcinoma (p = 0.004). Our study establishes a robust epigenetic-based 
prognostic model for NSCLC and identifies LYPD3 as a novel oncogenic driver, 
providing insights into tumor biology and treatment response, offering potential 
clinical utility for personalized therapeutic strategies.

Autologous hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) transplantation is 
performed after myeloablation in cancer treatment to restore blood cell 
production and support immune recovery. Despite its success in achieving 
survivorship, many recipients later suffer from recurrent infections and 
pulmonary complications. The mechanisms driving the complications after HSPC 
transplantation later in life are unknown. However, the induction and/or 
maintenance therapeutics might be driving the negative outcomes in treated 
patients. We investigated the effects of the cancer therapeutics topotecan and 
13-cis-retinoic acid (13cisRA) on cell phenotype and functions of HSPCs isolated 
from cord blood and primary monocytes from adult donors. In HSPCs, 13cisRA 
reduced autophagy and lysosomal activity, triggered a DNA damage response 
through increased γH2A.X and CDKN2 expression (including the spliced p14ARF 
isoform), and upregulated the epigenetic regulator SIRT3. 13cisRA also activated 
primary monocytes, inducing CXCL8 and CCL2 production. By contrast, topotecan 
had no effects on mature monocytes but induced DNA damage, metabolic remodeling, 
and epigenetic alterations in HSPCs. These changes included increased CDKN1A 
expression, higher γH2A.X-positive cell frequency, autophagy activation, and 
SIRT1 upregulation. The differential effects of 13cisRA and topotecan on HSPCs 
and monocytes might underlie the long-term complications of autologous HSPC 
transplantation. By modulating DNA damage, autophagy, and epigenetic pathways, 
these therapies could influence hematopoietic recovery and immune 
reconstitution, offering insights for improving transplantation outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer (CC), primarily linked to persistent HPV infection, 
arises from complex genetic and epigenetic alterations. The early detection of 
cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) allows for CC prevention. Recent data 
highlights the importance of epigenetic biomarkers, including non-coding RNAs 
such as miR-21 and miR-34a. Our aim was to investigate the interplay between 
Ki-67 and p53 expression and their epigenetic regulation by miR-21 and miR-34a 
to better predict the course of CIN.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tumor biopsies from 50 patients with CIN 1-3/HSIL were 
analyzed. We performed immunohistochemical analysis of Ki-67 and p53 expression 
and qRT-PCR for the analysis of miRNA expression.
RESULTS: The average miR-21 and miR-34a levels were 5.8 ± 2.8 and 1.42 ± 0.85 
(a.u.), respectively, while Ki-67 and p53 averaged 136.9 ± 79.9 and 93.15 ± 49.5 
H-score points. Positive correlations were found between miR-21 and Ki-67 (r = 
0.76) and miR-34a and p53 expressions (r = 0.65). Tumors with low Ki-67 showed 
2.48-fold lower miR-21 levels, and low p53 tumors showed 4.2-fold lower miR-34a 
levels. While no correlation with age or menstrual status was found, miR-21 (r = 
0.78), Ki-67 (r = 0.68), and miR-34a (r = -0.59) correlated with CIN grading (p 
< 0.05). The miR-21 and Ki-67 levels increased in CIN 2 and CIN 3 compared to 
CIN 1 in both HPV-positive and HPV-negative samples. The miR-34a levels were the 
lowest in CIN 3 HPV-negative samples and significantly decreased with CIN 
progression in HPV-positive samples. The p53 levels were significantly higher in 
CIN 3 cases of both the HPV-positive and HPV-negative groups.
CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that the miR‑21, miR-34a, Ki-67, and p53 
expression levels are significantly correlated with each other and are 
distinctly associated with the progression of CIN grades and HPV status, 
highlighting their potential as crucial CC biomarkers.

Tumor heterogeneity has been recognized as a critical characteristic of Ovarian 
Cancer (OC), significantly influencing chemotherapeutic response and overall 
patient survival. The VEGF/VEGFR2 signaling pathway genes serve as risk factor 
for metastasis and are associated with poor prognosis in many cancers including 
OC. DNA methylation of VEGF-A, VEGF-C and VEGFR2 genes contributing to their 
genetic changes based on histological sub-types has not been thoroughly explored 
in OC. Thus, the study aimed to determine the DNA methylation status of these 
genes in relation to their expression in tumor tissues and associated peritoneal 
fluid samples to evaluate usefulness of methylation as a prognostic indicator in 
ovarian carcinoma for future targeted therapies. Bisulfite-modified DNA 
methylation was assessed via Methylation-Specific Polymerase chain reaction 
(MSP) and mRNA expression was examined via quantitative reverse transcription 
PCR (RT-PCR), respectively. Gene expression and promoter methylation were 
examined in relation with clinical parameters in 100 OC samples. The methylation 
frequency of VEGF-A, VEGF-C and VEGFR2 promoters was higher in tumor tissues and 
matched Peritoneal Fluid (PF) compared to normal samples, while VEGF-A, VEGF-C 
and VEGFR2 mRNA expression levels were significantly elevated. Promoter 
methylation levels for VEGF-A (82%), VEGF-C (76%) and VEGFR2 (82%) showed 
significantly higher levels compared to benign cystadenomas, whereas amounts of 
VEGF-A and VEGFR2 were significantly higher than benign samples (p = 0.0003 and 
0.001). Expression and promoter methylation for VEGF-A (p = 0.0004, 0.0001) and 
VEGFR2 (p = 0.005, 0.001) significantly correlated with differences in 
histological sub-types in OC samples. No significant correlation was observed 
between promoter methylation and expression levels for VEGF-A, VEGF-C and VEGFR2 
genes. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis predicts poor prognosis for concurrent 
high expression and methylation of VEGF-A and VEGFR2 significantly correlated 
with advanced stage (log-rank p = 0.03, 0.01) and tumor histology (log rank 
p = 0.02, 0.01 respectively) in OC patients. Promoter methylation status of the 
VEGF-A and VEGFR2 genes could serve as valuable prognostic indicator in 
predicting poor prognosis in OC patients based on tumor histological sub-types.

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection mediates activation of oncogenes and 
inhibition of tumor suppressor genes through aberrant DNA methylation, which is 
the predominant risk factor for gastric tumorigenesis. Here, by integrating 
transcriptome and epigenetic multi-omics analyses of gastric tissues and mouse 
models, we identified that inhibitor of differentiation 4 (ID4) was 
downregulated in H. pylori-infected gastric tissues and associated with 
prognosis of gastric cancer (GC). H. pylori infection remarkably increased the 
methylation level of the ID4 promoter region in the GC patients and mouse 
models. ID4 served as a tumor suppressor gene in GC and was required for H. 
pylori-mediated tumorigenic activities in vitro cellular and in vivo 
tumor-bearing mouse models. Moreover, H. pylori infection induced DNMT3B 
upregulation through recruiting KLF5 to its promoter and further promoted ID4 
DNA methylation modification. Notably, ID4 formed heterodimers with the basic 
HLH transcription factors DEC1 to inhibit its transcriptional activity; 
therefore, downregulation of ID4 promoted SHH/GLI1 signaling through a DEC1 
dependent transcriptional modulation. Collectively, our findings indicate H. 
pylori infection depends on DNMT3B to induce ID4 DNA methylation and ID4 
promoter hypermethylation status is a potential biomarker to identify GC. Loss 
of ID4 could be a key component of H. pylori-mediated gastric tumorigenesis 
through dysregulation of DEC1/SHH/GLI1 axis, which provides potential 
therapeutic targets in GC.

Histone acetylation, a fundamental component of epigenetic modification, plays a 
pivotal role in the progression, treatment, and prognosis of numerous cancers. 
In this study, we systematically investigated, for the first time, the clinical 
value of histone acetylation (HAT) modification in the prognostic assessment of 
cervical cancer. Utilizing the GSE44001 and The Cancer Genome Atlas-CESC 
databases, a HAT-associated prognostic model comprising 7 pivotal genes was 
formulated through Lasso-Cox regression analysis. The integration of multiple 
bioinformatics algorithms (including Cibersort, ESTIMATE, ssGSEA, and TIDE) has 
enabled the profound delineation of immune microenvironmental characteristics 
among disparate risk groups. Utilizing molecular docking technology, we 
conducted a screening process that identified 2 potential target drugs. The 
prognostic model's predictive efficacy was successfully validated in an 
independent cohort. The analysis has revealed that the high-risk group exhibits 
a pronounced immunosuppressive phenotype. The study identified 2 additional 
factors that contribute to the prognosis of cervical cancer: CPE and PGK1. These 
factors have been shown to be significantly associated with poor clinical 
outcomes. In addition, we have identified 2 drugs that may target CPE and PGK1, 
namely Z-LLNle-CHO and OSU-03-012. The discovery of these drugs has opened up a 
new potential pathway for overcoming resistance to immunotherapy. This study 
addresses a significant research gap concerning HAT in the prognostic assessment 
of cervical cancer. Furthermore, it offers a crucial molecular basis for 
clinical decisions regarding individualized therapeutic interventions.

BACKGROUND: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains a leading cause of 
cancer-related mortality worldwide. Despite advancements in treatment, drug 
resistance and limited therapeutic efficacy persist, underscoring the urgent 
need for novel and mechanistically informed therapeutic strategies. Identifying 
genetically supported drug targets may accelerate the development of precision 
therapies in NSCLC.
METHODS: We implemented an integrative multi-omics framework combining 
single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), genome-wide association studies (GWAS), 
and molecular quantitative trait locus (QTL) datasets including expression 
(eQTL), protein (pQTL), and DNA methylation (mQTL) QTLs. Druggable candidates 
were systematically evaluated using a suite of Mendelian randomization (MR) 
approaches-including summary data-based MR (SMR), generalized SMR (GSMR), and 
genetic risk score (GRS) analysis. Epigenetic regulation and downstream 
signaling were further explored through mediation MR analysis.
RESULTS: C4BPA, a complement-regulatory macromolecule, emerged as a risk factor 
for NSCLC across multiple MR models, with consistent findings validated at both 
transcriptomic and proteomic levels. Epigenetic activation of C4BPA via DNA 
methylation was observed, and C4BPA expression was shown to promote NSCLC 
progression through the inflammatory chemokine CCL8 signaling axis. Sensitivity 
analyses confirmed the robustness of association inference.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings identify C4BPA as a genetically validated and 
biologically plausible therapeutic target for NSCLC. This study demonstrates the 
power of integrating single-cell transcriptomics with population-scale omics and 
association inference to uncover actionable targets, offering a scalable 
framework for advancing precision oncology in lung cancer.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths and obesity 
is a known risk factor for its development and poor prognosis. Adipose tissue 
(AT) actively contributes to CRC progression and cachexia. Here, we investigated 
molecular crosstalk between tumor cells and different visceral AT depots 
(normal, intra- and peri-tumoral), focusing on metabolic and (epi)genetic 
alterations. Using WGS analysis, we explored VAT role in CRC progression, 
demonstrating how its proximity to the tumor impacts metabolic and phenotypic 
changes. Intra-VAT (within 5 cm of lesion), closest to the tumor, underwent 
significant metabolic remodeling, characterized by upregulation of markers of 
the white-brown AT transition (UCP-1, TMEM26), lipid metabolism (PON3) and a 
reduction in adipocyte turnover (Pref-1, adiponectin). Peri-VAT (within 15 cm) 
and HVAT (over 15 cm) exhibited progressively fewer alterations, suggesting a 
gradient effect of tumor on surrounding AT. Intra-VAT displayed increased 
fibrosis (TGF-β, collagen) and cachexia-related markers (IL-8), and mutations in 
key oncogenes (KRAS, HLA, MET), highlighting a direct interaction between tumor 
cells and AT driving CRC progression. Mutations in genes such as KRAS, HLA, and 
PIK3CA were shared between CRC and its Intra-VAT, indicating potential 
biomarkers for tumor progression and immune evasion. miRNA analysis revealed 
upregulation of miR-21 and miR-92a in Intra-VAT, with circulating miR-92a 
correlating with increased body fat and decreased lean mass in CRC patients, 
suggesting their involvement in both local metabolic remodeling and systemic 
changes. Altered PON3 DNA methylation patterns were also observed, correlating 
with metabolic parameters. Our findings underscore AT's critical role in the CRC 
microenvironment as an active player in CRC progression and cachexia. Metabolic 
and genetic alterations decreased in VAT with increasing distance from the 
tumor. Intra-VAT may serve as a critical therapeutic target and biomarker for 
CRC progression, impacting surgical and postoperative strategies. Future studies 
should focus on targeting tumor-adipose crosstalk to improve treatment outcomes, 
including experimental validation of the identified genetic alterations and 
investigation of their functional roles in tumor progression and immune evasion.

Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is a rare pediatric 
myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by distinct epigenetic 
signatures that facilitate molecular classification. This study aimed to 
evaluate the diagnostic utility of locus-specific DNA methylation in the bone 
morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) gene as a single predictor of disease outcomes in 
a cohort of 111 children diagnosed with JMML, alongside 9 healthy controls. 
Methylation levels of BMP4, assessed through targeted bisulfite next-generation 
sequencing (bs-NGS), were heterogeneous within the JMML cohort and were 
significantly associated with clinical risk factors, such as patient age, and 
fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels. A comparative analysis of BMP4 bs-NGS and 
genome-wide methylation array data revealed a strong positive correlation 
(p < 0.001). The sensitivity and specificity of BMP4 bs-NGS for classifying 
high-methylation cases were 0.612 and 0.887, respectively. For PTPN11-mutant 
patients (N = 40), the sensitivity was 0.667 and the specificity was 0.842. 
Survival analysis indicated that patients with high BMP4 methylation (BMP4h) had 
lower 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rates than those with normal BMP4 
methylation (BMP4n). Specifically, the 20% of patients with highest BMP4 
methylation had a 5-year DFS of 0.38, in contrast to 0.62 for the lowest 20% 
(p = 0.007). These findings highlight the potential of BMP4 methylation analysis 
as a complementary biomarker for JMML risk stratification, mirroring genome-wide 
methylation profiles known to associate with prognostic subgroups.

BACKGROUND: The expression of imprinted genes, which depends on their gamete of 
origin, is regulated by DNA sequences characterized by differential methylation 
between the maternal and paternal alleles (also known as germline differentially 
methylated regions or gDMRs). The most common molecular defect associated with 
Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS), a condition linked to overgrowth and tumours, 
is the loss of methylation of the KCNQ1OT1-TSS gDMR located on chromosome 
11p15.5 (also known as IC2 LoM). Approximately one-third of BWS patients with 
IC2 LoM exhibit multi-locus imprinting disturbances (MLID). While 
maternal-effect variants in proteins of the oocyte subcortical maternal complex 
(SCMC) have been linked to MLID, the underlying mechanisms and health impact of 
this epigenetic disturbance remain unclear.
RESULTS: We used the Infinium EPIC methylation array to investigate whole-genome 
CpG methylation in 64 BWS patients with IC2 LoM and 37 control subjects. We 
distinguished two patient groups, one with a variable methylation level of 24 
gDMRs and the other with single-locus IC2 LoM. We observed that the mothers of 
the former patient group carried more variants in maternal-effect genes than 
those of the latter group, and 50% of them, but none of the latter group had 
variants in the SCMC genes. Additionally, in the former group, the mothers were 
older at the time of pregnancy, and the patients showed higher variation in 
methylation levels of thousands of CpGs located in non-imprinted loci, including 
protochaderins and cancer-associated genes. We found no differences in clinical 
features or in the incidence of assisted reproductive technology between the two 
patient groups. However, multiple affected siblings and recurrent miscarriages 
were observed only among cases with biallelic maternal-effect SCMC gene 
variants.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the BWS patients with MLID exhibit 
highly variable methylation changes that affect both imprinted and non-imprinted 
loci in a seemingly stochastic manner throughout the genome. These findings 
support the hypothesis that MLID results from the interaction of maternal-effect 
genes and environmental factors in aged oocytes, leading to disordered DNA 
methylation in the whole genome. Future research should investigate whether and 
how these epimutations impact the health of affected individuals, particularly 
in adulthood.

OBJECTIVE: Increasing evidence indicated substantial involvement of 
non-Helicobacter pylori microbiota in gastric tumorigenesis. We aimed to 
elucidate detailed relationship of microbiome dynamics between two different 
steps in gastric cancer (GC) such as cancer initiation and progression, and 
assessed their associations with clinicopathological and molecular changes.
METHODS: We systemically characterized gastric microbiome during GC initiation 
and progression using 944 biopsies from primary GC, non-cancerous gastric mucosa 
from both GC and non-cancer subjects. The association between specific microbial 
characteristics and GC risk, prognosis and molecular changes such as TP53 
mutation, DNA methylation and telomere shortening were also evaluated.
RESULTS: Microbial α-diversity in the gastric mucosa was decreased in relation 
to the GC occurrence, while it increased in primary GC tissue. Such paradoxical 
change was also observed in specific groups of bacteria during GC occurrence and 
its progression. GC risk-related microbiome was associated with differentiated 
GC, severe intestinal metaplasia, associated DNA methylation and telomere 
shortening, while GC tissue-specific microbiome was associated with more 
aggressive features of GC and TP53 mutation status.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggested the different role of non-Helicobacter 
pylori microbiota in GC initiation and progression steps.

BACKGROUND: Endometrial clear cell carcinoma (ECCC) is a rare and highly 
aggressive histological subtype of endometrial cancer with marked metastatic 
potential. The molecular characteristics and underlying mechanisms governing its 
metastatic behaviour remain poorly understood. This study aimed to delineate 
molecular distinctions between metastatic (Pm) and non-metastatic (Pn) primary 
ECCC tumours, elucidate DNA methylation-mediated regulatory mechanisms driving 
metastasis, and identify potential epigenetic biomarkers and therapeutic 
targets.
METHODS: This multicentre study involved 51 individuals diagnosed with ECCC, 
leading to the establishment of two independent cohorts: a sequencing cohort (n 
= 35) for integrated whole-genome methylation and transcriptomic analysis, and a 
tissue microarray (TMA) cohort (n = 16) to validate key findings.
FINDINGS: Tumours exhibiting metastasis were found to possess a profoundly 
immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment (TME), evidenced by reduced density of 
tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), especially within subsets of anti-tumour 
immune cells. Further analysis highlighted differential hypermethylation events 
in Pm tumours that acted as crucial epigenetic switches regulating immune 
responses. Specifically, methylation at ETS1-binding sites influenced ETS1 
regulon activity, thus broadly regulating immune response processes. Epigenetic 
silencing of key genes in the T cell receptor (TCR) signalling pathway, such as 
LCK, CD3E, and ZAP70, impaired T cell activation and inhibited the activity of 
interacting immune pathways. Additionally, we developed a Lasso-derived 
metastatic risk score model, incorporating TME features (TIL density) and 
epigenetic predictors (LCK methylation), which demonstrated strong predictive 
performance (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.859).
INTERPRETATION: This study illuminated the ""epigenetic-immune axis"" as a central 
regulatory mechanism driving ECCC metastasis. DNA methylation systematically 
silenced immune response genes by targeting ETS1-binding sites and TCR 
signalling components, thus reconstructing the immunosuppressive TME to 
facilitate metastasis. The development of the metastatic risk score model and 
identification of LCK as a potential therapeutic target provide valuable 
strategies for precision treatment decisions and advancing targeted 
epigenetic-immune therapies in ECCC.

Aging is a complex biological process, and some individuals are aging faster or 
slower than expected. This phenomenon of aging acceleration occurs when 
biological age exceeds chronological age and can be assessed by epigenetic clock 
estimation. As aging acceleration is known to occur in response to some 
environmental exposures as well as trauma, we hypothesized that World Trade 
Center (WTC) exposures may have led to epigenetic aging acceleration. 
WTC-exposed women were selected from the World Trade Center Environmental Health 
Center (WTC EHC) clinic, with peripheral blood collected during routine clinical 
monitoring visits. The reference group was selected from the NYU Women's Health 
Study (NYUWHS), a prospective cohort study that collected blood samples before 
9/11/2001. Epigenomes of WTC-exposed vs. unexposed women were profiled using the 
Infinium MethylationEPIC array. DNA-based epigenetic aging was estimated using 
Hannum, Horvath, PhenoAge and GrimAge epigenetic clocks. Age acceleration was 
defined as the residual from regressing estimated epigenetic age on 
chronological age. Ordinary least squares regression was used to investigate the 
relationship between WTC exposure and accelerated aging. After adjustment for 
race/ethnicity, smoking status, Body Mass Index (BMI), batch and cell type 
composition, WTC exposure was associated with epigenetic aging acceleration 
using the Hannum epigenetic clock (βWTC Exposed vs. Unexposed: 3.789; p-value: 
<0.001). WTC exposure was also associated with epigenetic aging acceleration 
when using other epigenetic clock types (Horvath and PhenoAge, but not GrimAge), 
and when stratifying by breast cancer case (βWTC Exposed vs. Unexposed: 3.473; 
p-value: <0.001) or cancer-free participant (βWTC Exposed vs. Unexposed: 4.369; 
p-value: 0.001) status. Among all participants, having a breast cancer diagnosis 
was statistically significantly associated with accelerated aging (βCancer vs. 
cancer-free: 1.658; p-value: 0.021). WTC exposure is statistically significantly 
associated with epigenetic aging acceleration. This was true even after 
stratifying on cancer status. WTC exposure was positively associated with 
epigenetic aging acceleration in the overall cohort, among only those women who 
were cancer-free, and among breast cancer cases.

Arsenic, a common environmental pollutant, causes skin damage with long-term 
exposure. Although its pathogenic mechanism remains unclear, skin cell 
senescence creates a microenvironment that promotes cancer development, with the 
mechanisms accelerating disease progression in arsenic-induced skin damage 
attracting significant attention. This study utilised previously collected skin 
samples to evaluate the associations between skin senescence and damage 
indicators. According to the presence or absence of arsenic exposure, 
participants were divided into a reference group and an arsenic exposure group. 
Additionally, the arsenic exposure group was further divided into a common 
pathological changes group, a hyperkeratosis group, and a skin cancer group, 
based on skin histopathological examination. Compared with the reference group, 
the arsenic exposure group exhibited increased expression of 
senescence-associated secretory phenotypes (IL-6 and IL-17) and shortened 
relative telomere length (RTL). With increasing severity of skin damage, IL-6 
and IL-17 levels progressively increased, while RTL progressively decreased. 
Examination of representative indicators of arsenic-induced skin damage 
(epithelial-mesenchymal transition [EMT] indicators) revealed decreased 
E-cadherin expression and increased vimentin expression. With increasing 
severity of skin damage, E-cadherin expression progressively decreased, while 
vimentin expression progressively increased. Moreover, clear correlations were 
observed between senescence-related markers (IL-6, IL-17, and RTL) and 
arsenic-induced skin damage markers (E-cadherin, vimentin) in the human samples. 
In vitro experiments demonstrated that arsenic induced lower expression of the 
telomere-related gene PARP1, reducing its binding to TERF2 and weakening its 
recruitment of BLM, thereby causing telomere dysfunction, promoting the 
senescence of HaCaT cells, and resulting in EMT. Additionally, arsenic exposure 
induced high expression of DNMT3, which mediated PARP1 hypermethylation and low 
expression. Treatment with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 
5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine restored PARP1 expression in arsenic-treated HaCaT cells, 
regulated telomere dysfunction, improved cellular senescence, and alleviated 
EMT. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying 
arsenic-induced skin damage from an epigenetic and genetic perspective.

The function of the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (referred hereafter 
as TERT) in the synthesis and maintenance of chromosome ends, or telomeres, is 
widely understood. Whether and how telomeres, on the other hand, influence TERT 
regulation is relatively less studied. We found TERT was transcriptionally 
altered depending on telomere length (TL). This resulted from TL-dependent 
binding of TRF2 between telomeres and the TERT promoter. TERT promoter-bound 
TRF2 was non-telomeric and did not involve the looping of telomeres to the TERT 
promoter. Cell lines from different tissue types fibrosarcoma (HT1080), colon 
cancer (HCT116), and breast cancer (MDA-MB-231), engineered for either telomere 
elongation/shortening, gave an increase/decrease in TERT, respectively. 
Mechanistically, we show TERT promoter-bound non-telomeric TRF2 recruits the 
canonical PRC2-complex, inducing repressor histone H3K27-trimethylation in a 
TL-dependent fashion. This was further supported by TL-dependent promoter 
activity from an exogenously inserted TERT reporter. Increase in TL over days 
followed by a gradual decline, resulted in activation followed by repression of 
TERT in a concerted manner, further implicating TL as a key factor for TERT 
regulation. Notably, on reprogramming primary fibroblasts to induced pluripotent 
stem cells (iPSCs), TRF2 loss from the TERT promoter was evident along with 
telomere elongation and TERT upregulation. Conversely, on telomere shortening in 
iPSCs, TERT promoter-bound TRF2 was restored with a marked reduction in TERT, 
further supporting the causal role of TL in TERT transcription. Mechanisms of 
tight control of TERT by TL shown here are likely to have major implications in 
telomere-related physiologies, particularly, cancer, ageing, and pluripotency.

Plain Language Summary: Human cells typically have 23 pairs of structures known 
as chromosomes, each containing a unique set of genes that provides the 
instructions needed to make proteins and other essential molecules found in the 
body. At the end of each chromosome lies a region of repetitive DNA sequences, 
known as the telomere, which protects the chromosome strands from damage or 
tangling. Every time a cell divides, some of the telomere repeats are cut off, 
causing the telomeres to shorten. Specific enzymes known as telomerases can add 
these repeats back on so that the telomeres do not become too short. As we age, 
telomeres naturally shorten in length, but certain lifestyle factors can 
accelerate this process, leading to programmed cell death and contributing to 
various diseases, including cancers. In 2018, researchers showed that TRF2, a 
key telomere protein, helps relay information about telomere length to various 
regulatory genes. However, it remained unclear whether TRF2 could directly 
communicate this information to the telomerase itself. Sengupta et al. – 
including several of the researchers from the 2018 study – set out to answer 
this question by studying multiple human cancer cell lines with different 
telomere lengths. They discovered that TRF2 acts like a messenger that interacts 
with the telomerase gene TERT, in a length-dependent manner. When telomeres were 
long, most TRF2 remained bound at the telomeres and did not interact with TERT, 
allowing continued telomerase activity and telomere elongation. By contrast, 
when telomeres were short, TRF2 was released from the telomeres and bound 
directly to the TERT promoter. There, together with a DNA structure called the 
G-quadruplex, TRF2 suppressed TERT expression and thereby limited further 
telomere extension. In other words, shortened telomeres repressed TERT 
expression, while elongated ones increased it. In this positive feedback–like 
reinforcement system, telomere length is signaled by the amount of free TRF2 
protein. When TERT expression is high and telomeres are long, less TRF2 is 
available to bind the TERT promoter, reducing repression and thereby maintaining 
its expression. Conversely, when TERT expression is low and telomeres are short, 
more TRF2 is available, reinforcing repression and sustaining the low-expression 
state. Regulating telomere length is essential for healthy cell function, and 
its dysregulation is a hallmark of cancer. Sengupta et al. demonstrated that 
TRF2 plays a critical role in this process by feeding back information about 
telomere length directly to the TERT gene. By further dissecting this feedback 
system and refining experimental tools, researchers may gain new insights into 
telomere regulation in cancer and related diseases.

We identified new diagnostic markers for ovarian cancer based on the analysis of 
aberrant methylation in a group of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) genes. Using 
quantitative methyl-specific PCR with the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test, a 
significant (p < 0.01) increase in the methylation levels of three lncRNA genes 
(KCNK15-AS1, MAGI2-AS3, SSTR5-AS1) was demonstrated in a representative cohort 
of 56 clinical ovarian cancer samples. Using quantitative reverse transcription 
PCR on the same sample set, a significant decrease in the expression of these 
three lncRNA genes (p < 0.01) and a statistically significant inverse 
correlation between changes in methylation and expression levels (r < -0.5) were 
demonstrated, which confirms the functional role of methylation in suppressing 
their expression in tumor tissues. ROC analysis was used to assess the 
diagnostic potential of these genes. It was shown that the detection of 
methylation in at least one of the three genes in tissue DNA samples allows for 
identification of ovarian cancer with 98% sensitivity and 100% specificity (test 
> 0, AUC = 0.989). The developed marker panel may be of interest for the 
molecular assessment of at-risk patients when determining a preliminary 
diagnosis. However, the method requires validation on a larger, more 
representative sample set.

Insights into variation in monocyte context-specific splicing and transcript 
usage are limited. Here, we perform paired gene and transcript QTL mapping 
across distinct immune states using RNA sequencing data of monocytes isolated 
from a cohort of 185 healthy Europeans incubated alone or in the presence of 
interferon gamma (IFN-γ) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We identify regulatory 
variants for 5749 genes and 8727 transcripts, with 291 context-specific 
transcript QTL colocalizing with GWAS loci. Notable disease relevant 
associations include IFN-γ specific transcript QTL at COVID-19 severity locus 
rs10735079, where allelic variation modulates context-specific splicing of OAS1, 
and at rs4072037, a risk allele for gastro-esophageal cancer, which associates 
with context-specific splicing of MUC1. We use DNA methylation data from the 
same cells to demonstrate overlap between methylation QTL and causal 
context-specific expression QTL, permitting inference of the direction of 
effect. Finally, we identify a subset of expression QTL that uncouple genes from 
proximally acting regulatory networks, creating 'co-expression QTL' with 
different allele-specific correlation networks. Our findings highlight the 
interplay between context and genetics in the regulation of the monocyte gene 
expression and splicing, revealing putative mechanisms of diverse disease risk 
alleles including for COVID-19 and cancer.

Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), a potent dietary carcinogen, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), 
an oncogenic virus, are both implicated in cancer development, particularly in 
endemic regions. However, the combined effects of AFB1 exposure and EBV 
infection on the epigenetic landscape remain poorly understood. This study 
investigates the impact of AFB1 and EBV on histone post-translational 
modifications (hPTMs) in Burkitt lymphoma (BL) cells through an integrative 
approach combining untargeted mass spectrometry-based profiling and a time-lapse 
experimental design. Our results reveal subtle, yet reproducible and dynamic 
alterations in histone methylation and acetylation patterns over time in all 
cells. Specifically, AFB1 exposure induced an increase in H3K27me3 levels, which 
in the case of EBV infected cells, counteracts the decrease observed at baseline 
compared to uninfected cells. Additionally, changes in acetylation patterns of 
H4 N-tail residues and key regulatory proteins suggest potential disruptions in 
chromatin accessibility and transcriptional regulation. Our correlation and 
network-based analyses further highlight coordinated epigenetic shifts in 
response to AFB1, with key acetylation hubs emerging within the histone PTM 
profile. Despite subtle differences, no significant divergence in overall hPTM 
responses was detected between EBV-infected and uninfected cells, emphasizing 
the subtlety of the EBV effect on AFB1 exposure. Future research should explore 
locus-specific epigenetic changes and therapeutic interventions targeting hPTMs 
to mitigate cancer risk associated with AFB1 exposure and EBV infection.

BACKGROUND: Ovarian cancer remains the deadliest gynecological malignancy with 
5-year survival rates below 40% due to frequent recurrence and chemoresistance. 
Aberrant crotonylation, a type of epigenetic modification, has been implicated 
in the proliferation, metastasis, and immune evasion of various cancers. 
However, its role in the ovarian cancer microenvironment and clinical outcomes 
remains unexplored. The aim of this study was to develop a prognostic model for 
ovarian cancer on the basis of crotonylation and to investigate the underlying 
mechanisms and potential of crotonylation for targeted therapy.
METHODS: We systematically analyzed single-cell RNA-seq and bulk transcriptomic 
datasets from ovarian cancer patients. Cellular crotonylation activity was 
quantified using AUCell algorithm. Potential prognostic genes were identified 
through DEG analysis and Weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA), and 
the associated molecular mechanisms were elucidated via Gene set enrichment 
analysis (GSEA). An ovarian cancer prognosis model were constructed by 
integrating machine learning algorithms. Immune microenvironment features were 
assessed using CIBERSORT, ESTIMATE and TIDE algorithms, with drug sensitivity 
predicted via genomics of drug sensitivity in cancer.
RESULTS: The ovarian cancer microenvironment is characterized by abundant immune 
cell infiltration, with significant differences in crotonylation levels among 7 
cell subtypes. We identified 451 key crotonylation-related genes. The 
crotonylation risk score (RS) model demonstrated robust prognostic performance. 
High-RS groups showed immunosuppressive characteristics: decreased follicular 
helper T cells and activated NK cells, concomitant with M2 macrophage 
enrichment. Elevated RS was associated with increased stromal activation, as 
indicated by a higher ESTIMATE score, and enhanced immune evasion potential, 
reflected by an elevated TIDE score. Notably, high-RS patients exhibited 
upregulated PDL1 and CD40, suggesting increased immunotherapy susceptibility. 
Pharmacogenomic analysis identified vinblastine with differential sensitivity, 
providing actionable targets for RS-stratified therapy.
CONCLUSION: We elucidated the significant impact of crotonylation on the ovarian 
cancer microenvironment and prognosis. We developed and validated a novel 
prognostic model for ovarian cancer that can serve as a tool for predicting 
patient outcomes and characterizing the immune microenvironment. These findings 
enhance our understanding of the role of crotonylation in ovarian cancer and 
establish a robust framework for developing therapeutic strategies targeting 
crotonylation.

INTRODUCTION: Heredity and epigenetic factors contribute to the pathogenesis of 
neutrophil-cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV). Cytotoxic T 
lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), an inhibitory receptor regulating 
T-cell homeostasis and maintaining self-tolerance, has emerged as a key target 
for immune screening and therapeutics in autoimmunity and cancer. CTLA-4 is 
associated with various autoimmune diseases; however, the relationship between 
CTLA-4 polymorphisms and AAV in the Guangxi population of China remains 
underexplored. In the present case-control study, we evaluated the effects of 
CTLA-4 polymorphisms on AAV susceptibility in the Guangxi population of China.
METHODS: A total of 343 patients with AAV and 343 healthy controls were 
recruited. High-throughput sequencing was used to genotype CTLA4 variants, and 
logistic regression analysis was used to assess their association with AAV risk. 
The relationship between the haplotypes of CTLA4 single-nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs) and AAV risk was assessed using the SHEsis platform.
RESULTS: Three CTLA4 SNPs- rs62182595, rs16840252, and rs5742909- showed 
significant association with AAV susceptibility. The ATT and GCC haplotypes, 
comprising these loci, were also associated with an increased risk of AAV.
DISCUSSION: These findings suggest that CTLA4 polymorphisms (rs62182595, 
rs16840252, and rs5742909) may contribute to AAV susceptibility in the Guangxi 
population and offer preliminary markers for risk assessment, early diagnosis, 
and personalized management of AAV.

Objective. To improve survival prediction for HER2-positive breast cancer by 
integrating histopathological, molecular, and clinical data using a multimodal 
transformer framework.Approach. We propose a multimodal transformer framework 
for breast cancer survival prediction using HER2 stratified (SurvMBC), a 
foundation model-enhanced architecture that fuses three data modalities: 
whole-slide images, clinical narratives, and molecular features. Tumor 
microenvironment features are extracted using a pathology language and image 
pre-training (PLIP), clinical narratives are processed with BioBERT, and miRNA 
expression plus DNA methylation data are embedded using Gen2Vec. These 
representations are integrated through a cross-modal transformer with attention 
mechanisms for survival prediction.Main results. The model was evaluated on 
1,095 HER2-positive breast cancer patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas. SurvMBC 
achieved a concordance index (C-index) of 0.857 (95% CI: 0.834, 0.880), a low 
integrated Brier score, and a strong inverse negative binomial log-likelihood. 
Risk stratification based on model outputs significantly separated high- and 
low-risk groups (log-rankp< 0.01) and showed strong associations with tumor 
stage, grade, and hormone receptor status (allp< 0.05).Significance. SurvMBC 
demonstrates the effectiveness of multimodal fusion in addressing tumor 
heterogeneity and improving prognostic accuracy. The attention-based integration 
enables context-aware learning of survival-relevant features across modalities, 
supporting individualized risk stratification and risk-adaptive treatment 
planning for HER2 stratified breast cancer patients.

BACKGROUND: French and International anal cancer screening recommendations for 
at-risk populations, published in 2024, are based on cytology and/or high-risk 
human papillomavirus (HPV) detection on anal smears. Biological markers to 
triage the patients most at-risk for anal cancer are crucial in prioritising 
patients needing high-resolution anoscopy consultations, which are frequently 
overwhelmed.
METHODS: The AIN3 cohort is a French national multicenter study including 
patients with a history of high-grade anal lesions (AIN3). Patients were 
followed-up for at least 3 years, with anal smears and clinical examinations 
performed yearly. Levels of ZNF582 and ASCL1 gene methylation were quantified 
using real-time PCR on anal smears collected at the time of inclusion.
FINDINGS: Overall, 514 anal smears were contributive for host-cell DNA 
methylation analysis. Patients' mean age was 50.8 years and 40% were women. 
Among the 41% who were living with HIV, 91% were men. Median follow-up duration 
was 48 months, and 22 patients (4%) developed anal cancer during follow-up. 
Higher methylation levels of ZNF582 and ASCL1 were significantly associated with 
high-grade squamous cell intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) cytology, p16-Ki67 
dual-staining positivity, and high-risk HPV and HPV16 positivity on the same 
anal smear. Both methylation markers showed an AUC of 0.72 for discrimination 
between HSIL and non-HSIL cytology on the same anal smear. Higher methylation 
levels of both markers were significantly associated with evolution to anal 
cancer in univariate and multivariable analyses adjusted for age and HIV status 
(p < 0.001). When assessing the AUC over 1 and 3 years of follow-up, methylation 
markers demonstrated superior predictive value for anal cancer compared to other 
markers.
INTERPRETATION: We have demonstrated the predictive value of host-cell DNA 
methylation marker levels in anal smears with regard to evolution to anal cancer 
in a very high-risk population.

BackgroundEuchromatic histone-lysine N-methyltransferase 2 (EHMT2), a 
neuroinflammatory histone methyltransferase, has been proposed as a therapeutic 
target for Alzheimer's disease (AD), potentially via modulation of gut 
microbiota. However, causality remains unclear due to confounding in 
observational studies and lack of human genetic evidence.ObjectiveTo address 
this, we conducted a Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using genome-wide 
association data exclusively from individuals of European ancestry.MethodsWe 
obtained genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics for EHMT2 
expression, AD (n = 39,106), 211 gut microbiota taxa, and colorectal cancer 
(CRC; n = 6847) from the IEU OpenGWAS and FinnGen databases. MR was used to 
evaluate the causal effects, with CRC as a positive control. Five regression 
models were utilized to evaluate the causal effects, and two-step MR assessed 
the mediating role of gut microbiota. Sensitivity analyses tested result 
robustness.ResultsInverse-variance weighted (IVW) analyses showed that EHMT2 
inhibition was associated with reduced risks of CRC [odds ratio (OR) = 0.7850, 
95% CI: 0.6782-0.9086, p = 0.0012], and AD (OR = 0.8585, 95% CI: 0.8056-0.9148, 
p < 0.0001). EHMT2 inhibition also influenced the abundance of 67 gut microbiota 
taxa. Among them, 17 taxa were linked to AD risk, with four showing shared 
causal associations. Notably, three of them (family Lactobacillaceae id.1836, 
genus Dialister id.2183, and unknown genus id.959) had positive mediating 
effects.ConclusionsEHMT2 inhibition may play protective roles in AD via 
modulating specific gut microbiota, particularly three key taxa. These findings 
highlight a potential microbiota-mediated epigenetic mechanism in AD 
pathogenesis, warranting further mechanistic and translational studies.

INTRODUCTION: Chronic caregiving stress accelerates biological aging, reflecting 
disease risk and mortality; however, the underlying mechanisms are poorly 
understood. Epigenetic clocks, which can be estimated from levels of DNA 
methylation in a subset of cytosine-phosphate-guanine loci in the genome, have 
been proposed as a promising biological age estimator. The objectives of this 
scoping review are to systematically scope the literature on the effects of 
stress on biological ageing measured by epigenetic clocks in family caregivers 
of patients diagnosed with cancer.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This review will be conducted following Joanna Briggs 
Institute methodology based on Arksey and O'Malley's and Levac et al's framework 
and reported using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for scoping reviews. Studies will be included 
if (1) the studies focus on unpaid family caregivers of patients diagnosed with 
cancer; (2) caregivers are adults (≥18 years of age) and (3) the study measured 
epigenetic clocks. The search will encompass literature and peer-reviewed 
literature in PubMed/MEDLINE (National Library of Medicine), Embase (Elsevier), 
Cochrane CENTRAL (Wiley & Sons), Web of Science: Core Collection (Clarivate 
Analytics), CINAHL (EBSCOhost) and PsycInfo (American Psychological 
Association).
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Since the scoping review methodology focuses on 
published literature, this study does not require ethical approval. We will 
publish our findings in a peer-reviewed journal and plan to disseminate our work 
in conferences and scientific meetings.

The cellular plasticity of neuroblastoma is defined by a mixture of two major 
cell states, adrenergic and mesenchymal, which may contribute to therapy 
resistance. However, how neuroblastoma cells switch cellular states during 
therapy remains largely unknown, and how to eradicate neuroblastoma regardless 
of its cell state is a clinical challenge. To better understand the cellular 
plasticity of neuroblastoma in chemoresistance, we define the transcriptomic and 
epigenetic map of adrenergic and mesenchymal types of neuroblastomas using human 
and murine models treated with indisulam, a selective RBM39 degrader. We show 
that cancer cells not only undergo a bidirectional switch between adrenergic and 
mesenchymal states, but also acquire additional cellular states, reminiscent of 
the developmental pliancy of neural crest cells. These cell state alterations 
are coupled with epigenetic reprogramming and dependency switching of cell 
state-specific transcription factors, epigenetic modifiers, and targetable 
kinases. Through targeting RNA splicing, indisulam induces an inflammatory tumor 
microenvironment and enhances the anticancer activity of natural killer cells. 
The combination of indisulam with anti-GD2 immunotherapy results in a durable, 
complete response in high-risk transgenic neuroblastoma models, providing an 
innovative, rational therapeutic approach to eradicate tumor cells regardless of 
their potential to switch cell states.

Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) is the primary type of liver malignancy, which 
stands as the third leading contributor to cancer-related death worldwide. Its 
development is associated with multifactors, which include viral hepatitis, 
metabolic syndrome, lifestyle factors, and dysregulation of many genetic and 
epigenetic signalling pathways. MicroRNAs play the main role in gene regulation 
in eukaryotic cells, which functions primarily through RISC, and their 
dysregulations with enhanced expression of RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) 
activity contribute to HCC pathogenesis. Staphylococcal nuclease 
domain-containing protein 1 (SND1), a core component of the RISC machinery, acts 
as an oncogene promoting tumor growth, invasion, and angiogenesis in HCC. 
Furthermore, aberrant telomerase activation, largely attributed to elevated 
expression of its catalytic subunit of human telomerase reverse transcriptase 
(hTERT), is a hallmark of approximately 90 % of cancers. Short-chain fatty acid 
(SCFA), Sodium Butyrate (NaBu), are gut microbiota-derived metabolites with 
emerging anti-cancer properties. NaBu acts as an HDAC inhibitor, exhibiting 
anti-proliferative, pro-apoptotic, and anti-inflammatory effects in various 
cancer models. In this study, we investigate the novel molecular mechanism by 
which NaBu regulates SND1 meditated hTERT expression in HCC and assess its 
anti-tumor efficacy through in-vitro cellular models.

Colon cancer remains a major cause of global cancer mortality, characterized by 
complex interactions between genetic, epigenetic, and immune factors. This study 
investigates the prognostic value of efferocytosis-related genes and their role 
in colon cancer progression and immune modulation. A prognostic signature relied 
on efferocytosis-related genes was developed using univariate Cox and least 
absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analyses. Immune 
infiltration, immune checkpoint expression, and tumor microenvironment 
characteristics were analyzed using single-sample gene set enrichment analysis 
(ssGSEA), ESTIMATE, and tumor immunophenotype (TIP) frameworks. S1PR5 was 
knocked down in SW1116 and SW620 cells. The effect of S1PR5 on colon cancer 
growth and macrophage regulation in vivo and in vitro. Colon cancer patients 
were stratified into high- and low-risk groups, with high-risk patients 
demonstrating significantly worse survival outcomes. S1PR5, a key gene in the 
model, was markedly overexpressed in colon cancer tumors and correlated with 
advanced clinical stages, poor survival outcomes, and diminished responses to 
immunotherapy. Furthermore, S1PR5 knockdown could inhibit colon cancer cell 
activity and increase macrophage polarization from M0 to M1. Our research 
developed an efferocytosis-related gene prognostic model and identified S1PR5 as 
a key biomarker. S1PR5 showed significant associations with advanced clinical 
stages, immunosuppressive microenvironments, and unfavorable survival outcomes, 
underscoring its potential as both a prognostic marker and a therapeutic target 
in colon cancer.

Cell-free DNA (cfDNA), shed by malignant tumor cells into extracellular fluid, 
provides valuable epigenetic information indicative of cancer status. Nipple 
aspirate fluid (NAF), a noninvasive liquid biopsy from at-risk women, contains 
nucleic acid and protein biomarkers from adjacent cancer cells, showing promise 
for breast cancer (BrC) detection. However, despite its potential, the 
application of cfDNA in NAF for BrC screening is still underexplored. Here, we 
report a proof-of-concept study for using cfDNA bisulfite sequencing (cfBS) to 
assess tumor DNA methylation signatures from NAF samples. For four healthy 
individuals and three BrC patients, cfBS achieved greater than 20× sequencing 
depth with an average coverage of 26.5× on the genome. A total of 7471 
differentially methylated regions were identified, with significant 
hypermethylation in BrC samples compared to healthy controls. Gene set 
enrichment analysis indicated that the differentially methylated genes (DMGs) 
were significantly associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). By 
developing a novel EMT scoring metric, we found that BrC samples had more of a 
mesenchymal phenotype than samples from healthy individuals. CDH1, WNT2, and 
TRIM29 were hypermethylated near the promoter region, while COL5A2 was 
hypermethylated in the coding region. The DNA methylation and EMT changes were 
validated through The Cancer Genome Atlas Breast Invasive Carcinoma study, which 
confirmed that DMGs were associated with gene expression change and that our 
methylation-based EMT score reliably distinguished tumors from healthy controls. 
Our findings support the utilization of the NAF cfDNA cfBS methylation profile 
for noninvasive BrC screening and pave the way for enhanced early detection of 
this disease.

Our study aims to systematically investigate the potential carcinogenic 
mechanisms of bisphenol A (BPA) in three gastrointestinal tumors: intrahepatic 
cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), colorectal cancer (CRC), and esophageal cancer. By 
systematically integrating multi-omics databases, including transcriptomics and 
single-cell transcriptomics, we identified overlapping targets between 
BPA-associated molecules and tumor-related genes. Functional enrichment revealed 
that these targets converge on key oncogenic pathways, includingcellular 
metabolic reprogramming (particularly glycolysis), tumor microenvironment 
remodeling via cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) activation, and dysregulation 
of cell cycle progression. Molecular docking verified strong binding affinity 
between BPA and key targets. Survival analysis linked GAPDH and HSP90AA1 in ICC, 
CDKN1A, CEBPB, and EGR1 in CRC, and DCN and CXCL12 in esophageal cancer to poor 
survival rates, highlighting their potential as prognostic biomarkers. Our 
findings demonstrate that BPA promotes gastrointestinal carcinogenesisthrough 
disrupting energy metabolism, activating CAFs to remodel the tumor 
microenvironment, and enhancing cancer cell proliferation. This multi-level 
evidence advances the risk assessment of BPA and identifies potential targets 
for prevention and therapy of BPA-linked gastrointestinal cancers. Environmental 
Implication. In addition to well-documented role in promoting endocrine-related 
diseases, the mechanisms by which hazardous compound bisphenol A (BPA) 
contributes to other pathological conditions must not be overlooked. Through 
systematic integration of biological evidence chains, this study revealed BPA's 
triple carcinogenic mechanism involving interference with cell cycle 
checkpoints, remodeling of tumor microenvironment stroma, and disruption of 
epigenetic regulation, thereby providing a novel target system for preventing 
environmental toxicant-induced gastrointestinal tumors.

BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease with high morbidity 
and mortality rates. Despite the availability of various treatments, a 
significant number of patients still face a high probability of recurrence or 
metastasis, which severely impacts their survival status. Traditional prognostic 
methods based on single-modality data and machine learning algorithms often fail 
to adequately capture the complex biological relationships and heterogeneous 
characteristics of breast cancer, leading to suboptimal prognostic performance. 
Therefore, there is an urgent need for a more accurate and effective method to 
predict the risk of recurrence and metastasis in breast cancer prognosis.
METHODS: In this study, we propose a novel method termed PCGMMF for breast 
cancer prognostic analysis. This method integrates histopathological images, 
clinical data, gene expression data, and DNA methylation data through multimodal 
fusion. We leverage a pre-trained Vision-LSTM model based on transfer learning 
to extract features from histopathological images. Additionally, we design a 
comprehensive feature selection strategy that includes support vector machine 
(SVM), Mantel test, and correlation analysis to filter features from gene 
expression data and DNA methylation data. Furthermore, to address the high 
heterogeneity of breast cancer and the independence and intersectionality of 
multimodal features, we propose a bidirectional attention and self-attention 
based enhanced multimodal feature fusion module called BSAMF.
RESULTS: Through a series of experiments, we evaluate the performance of PCGMMF. 
When predicting the recurrence and metastasis risk of breast cancer prognosis, 
PCGMMF achieves an accuracy of 0.903 and an AUC value of 0.924, outperforming 
other state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we provide an interpretability 
analysis of highly significant regions from histopathological images, which can 
serve as a reference for clinical practice.
CONCLUSION: PCGMMF offers a robust and innovative solution for breast cancer 
prognostic analysis by effectively integrating multimodal data and utilizing 
advanced deep learning techniques. It can effectively conduct breast cancer 
prognostic analysis and provide significant references for personalized 
precision treatment and clinical practice.

INTRODUCTION: Epigenetic changes are important modulators of gene expression. 
The histone acetyltransferase gene non-derepressible 5 (Gcn5) is emerging as a 
pivotal epigenetic player in metabolism and cancer, yet its role in obesity and 
cardiovascular disease remains elusive.
AIMS: To investigate Gcn5 role in obesity-related endothelial dysfunction.
METHODS: Human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) were exposed to vehicle or 
palmitic acid (200 uM) in the presence or in the absence of the Gcn5 
pharmacological inhibitor CPTH2 or gene silencing. Ex-vivo inhibition of Gcn5 
was performed in aortic rings from diet-induced obese and control mice. 
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed to investigate the epigenetic 
regulation of Nox2 promoter. In parallel, Gcn5/Nox2 expression was assessed by 
real-time PCR in vascular specimens isolated from obese patients and age-matched 
healthy controls. Endothelial-dependent vasodilation was also assessed in human 
vessels.
RESULTS: PA increased Gcn5 gene expression in HAECs. Gcn5 upregulation was 
associated with increased expression of the pro-oxidant enzyme Nox2. 
Interestingly, either Gcn5 inhibition or gene silencing prevented PA-induced 
Nox2 upregulation and oxidative stress accumulation. ChiP assay showed increased 
Gcn5 occupancy and enhanced histone 3 acetylation of lysine 14 (H3K14ac) on Nox2 
promoter. In aortic rings from obese mice, pharmacological inhibition of Gcn5 by 
CPTH2 rescued endothelial-dependent vasorelaxation as compared to vehicle. 
Finally, Gcn5 was increased in vessels from obese patients and correlated with 
Nox2 expression and endothelial dysfunction.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings shed light on the importance of epigenetic regulation 
in obesity and pinpoint Gcn5 as a therapeutic target to prevent endothelial 
dysfunction in cardiometabolic disease.

BACKGROUND: Intestinal flora, or gut microbiota, has increasingly been 
recognized for its potential role in cancer development and progression. Beyond 
direct interactions with systemic organs, gut microbiota and its metabolites can 
modulate epigenetic processes such as DNA methylation, histone modification, and 
non-coding RNA regulation. This study aims to bridge this gap by conducting a 
bibliometric and visualization analysis of the scientific literature on cancer 
associated with intestinal flora.
METHODS: We utilized bibliometric software to examine publication trends, 
citation patterns, and collaborative networks within the field. Visualization 
techniques were applied to pinpoint influential authors, institutions, and 
countries. The analysis encompassed a comprehensive search of relevant databases 
to gather data on publications related to intestinal flora and cancer.
RESULTS: Our findings indicate a substantial rise in publications over recent 
decades, signifying an intensifying focus on the intestinal flora-cancer 
connection. Key research hotspots identified include the microbiota's role in 
colorectal cancer, the interplay between microbiota and the host immune system, 
the epigenetic impacts of gut microbiota on cancer development, and the promise 
of microbiota-targeted therapies for cancer treatment. The analysis also 
revealed a network of prominent researchers, leading institutions, and countries 
at the forefront of this research area.
CONCLUSIONS: This study offers a panoramic view of the current research on 
cancer associated with intestinal flora and underscores potential avenues for 
future exploration. The insights gleaned from our bibliometric and visualization 
analysis may guide the development of targeted strategies for cancer prevention 
and treatment, harnessing the power of the gut microbiota.

BACKGROUND: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most prevalent and fatal 
cancer affecting women worldwide. The SWI/SNF complexes exhibit the ability to 
selectively replace subunits, thereby enabling a wide range of epigenetic 
functions. As an accessory subunit of this complex, ARID1B is critically 
involved in modulating chromatin accessibility and transcriptional regulation. 
Nevertheless, its precise contribution to TNBC pathogenesis remains poorly 
understood.
METHODS: ARID1B expression levels in TNBC were detected using immunofluorescence 
and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). To investigate 
ARID1B's biological functions in TNBC, a series of in vitro assays were 
conducted, complemented by subcutaneous tumor xenograft models. Mass 
spectrometry analysis was employed to identify ARID1B-interacting proteins, 
while RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed to screen downstream target genes 
regulated by ARID1B. The transcriptional regulatory mechanism of ZNF382 mediated 
by ARID1B was further validated through dual-luciferase reporter assays and 
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR. To determine if ZNF382 knockdown 
could reverse the cellular effects of ARID1B, SMARCC2, and SMARCB1 inhibition, 
functional rescue experiments were conducted.
RESULTS: We identified ARID1B as a notable E3 ubiquitin ligase gene associated 
with breast cancer prognosis, particularly serving as a risk prognostic factor 
in TNBC. Contrary to its previously reported function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, 
we observed that ARID1B transcriptionally represses ZNF382 by forming a novel 
SWI/SNF complex with SMARCC2 and SMARCB1. This newly assembled complex promotes 
TNBC proliferation and migration, highlighting a previously unrecognized 
mechanism of ARID1B in cancer development.
CONCLUSIONS: This research enhances the understanding of the intricate roles 
played by SWI/SNF complex components in TNBC and bridges the gap between the 
structural specificity of SWI/SNF assembly and the progression of cancer. These 
findings could potentially unveil novel therapeutic targets for TNBC, thereby 
advancing the development of more efficacious treatment approaches for this 
highly aggressive malignancy.

One of the hallmarks of malignant neoplasms is their ability to sustain growth 
under hypoxic conditions resulting from insufficient oxygenation of tumor 
tissues. Prolonged hypoxia is associated with the gradual adaptation of tumor 
cells to low oxygen levels, leading to the enhanced survival, increased 
metastatic potential, and development of resistance to anticancer therapies. The 
aim of this study was to investigate the mechanisms underlying adaptation of 
breast cancer cell to prolonged hypoxia and maintenance of the hypoxia-tolerant 
phenotype. Using long-term culturing under low oxygen conditions (1% O2), we 
established hypoxia-adapted sublines of luminal (MCF-7) and triple-negative 
(MDA-MB-231) breast cancer cells, characterized by a stable growth in a hypoxic 
environment. The acquisition of hypoxia tolerance was accompanied by the 
activation of the HIF-1α-dependent transcription factor STAT3 and persistent 
overexpression of Snail, a key downstream effector of STAT3. The maintenance and 
stabilization of hypoxia-tolerant phenotype are mediated by miR-181a-2, which 
targets the STAT3/Snail signaling axis in the resistant cells. Analysis of DNA 
methylation status revealed no significant changes in the expression or activity 
of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) in the hypoxia-adapted cells. However, 
pharmacological inhibition of DNMTs using decitabine, as well as DNMT knockdown, 
increased cell sensitivity to hypoxia and partially reversed the 
hypoxia-resistant phenotype, which was accompanied by the activation of 
pro-apoptotic p53 signaling. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the 
acquired hypoxia tolerance in breast cancer cells is mediated, at least in part, 
by the activation of the miR-181a-2/STAT3/Snail signaling pathway. Furthermore, 
the use of demethylating agents may represent a promising therapeutic approach 
to targeting hypoxia-tolerant cancer cell populations.

Cancer remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide, arising from a complex 
interplay of genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors. Although the role 
of micronutrients in cancer development has received limited attention, growing 
evidence suggests that vitamins, particularly vitamin D, may influence oncogenic 
pathways. This hypothesis manuscript explores the potential interaction between 
vitamin D and the oncogenic long non-coding RNA HOTAIR, providing a novel 
mechanistic explanation for the inverse correlation between vitamin D status and 
cancer risk. We support our hypothesis with in silico docking evidence, 
suggesting that vitamin D binds to bioactive domains within the structured 
regions of HOTAIR, potentially disrupting its interaction with chromatin 
regulators such as PRC2. This concept may offer a novel approach to cancer 
prevention and therapy.

Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) confers high lifetime cancer risk due to germline 
TP53 pathogenic variants (PV). A comprehensive surveillance regimen termed the 
'Toronto Protocol', has been adopted for early tumor detection, demonstrating 
improved survival among TP53 PV carriers. However, the protocol's 
""one-size-fits-all"" approach fails to consider individual cancer risk. To 
personalize screening, we developed a support vector machine model to predict 
early onset of primary tumors (age < 6) using peripheral blood methylation data 
of TP53 PV carriers (n = 237). Validation (n = 64) and external testing (n = 79) 
showed AUROC = 0.928 [0.835-1.000], F1-score = 0.692 [0.435-0.867], and 
NPV = 0.984 [0.946-1.000]. The model achieved 91% accuracy, correctly 
classifying 90% of patients with cancer before the age of six and 87% of 
cancer-free individuals in the external test set. Our tool enables risk 
stratification for early-onset malignancies, to optimize clinical surveillance 
and improve patient outcomes.

Low-grade gliomas (LGGs) represent a complex and aggressive category of brain 
tumors. Despite recent advancements in molecular subtyping and characterization, 
the necessity to identify additional molecular subtypes and biomarkers remains. 
To delineate survival subtypes in LGG, we propose a deep learning (DL)-based 
multi-omics SurvivalNet (MOST) model. By integrating histological RNA-seq, 
miRNA-seq, and DNA methylation data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas 
(TCGA), we applied the MOST model to analyze data from 497 LGG patients. We 
employed consensus clustering to reveal heterogeneous subtypes, validated our 
findings using an internal validation set through a supervised classification 
algorithm, and further evaluated the robustness of our model in an independent 
external cohort. The DL-based MOST model identified two optimal patient subtypes 
with significant differences in survival (P = 3.07E - 16) and demonstrated a 
robust model fit (C = 0.92 ± 0.02). This multi-omics model was validated using 
external Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CCGA) datasets, including RNA-Seq 
(N = 497, C = 0.85), miRNA array (N = 89, C = 0.80), and DNA methylation 
(N = 89, C = 0.61). High-risk subcategories exhibited increased expression of 
the homeobox (HOX) family genes, regulation of cholesterol homeostasis, 
glycolysis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition pathway enrichment, and a high 
density of M2 macrophages. Our study utilized deep learning to identify 
multi-omics features associated with differential survival outcomes in patients 
with LGG. This work is anticipated to significantly enhance prognosis prediction 
for LGG due to its robustness within the cohorts.

INTRODUCTION: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is considered as a risk factor for kidney 
cancer (KC). However, so far, there is no study in the literature that has 
explored genetic factors through which T2D drive the development and progression 
of KC. Therefore, this study attempted to explore T2D- and KC-causing shared key 
genes (sKGs) for revealing shared pathogenesis and therapeutic drugs as their 
common treatments.
METHODS: The integrated bioinformatics and system biology approaches were 
utilized in this study. The statistical LIMMA approach was used based web-tool 
GEO2R to detect differentially expressed genes (DEGs) through transcriptomics 
analysis. Then upregulated and downregulated DEGs for T2D and KC were combined 
to obtained shared DEGs (sDEGs) between T2D and KC. The STRING database was used 
to construct the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of sDEGs. Then 
Cytohubba plugin-in Cytoscape were used in the PPI network to disclose the sKGs 
based on different topological measures. The RegNetwork database was used in 
NetworkAnalyst to analyze co-regulatory networks of sKGs with transcription 
factors (TFs) and micro-RNAs to identify key TFs and miRNAs as the 
transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulators of sKGs, respectively. 
AutoDock Vina is a tool used for molecular docking. ADME/T properties were 24 
assessed using pkCSM and SwissADME.
RESULTS: At first, 74 shared DEGs (sDEGs) were identified that can distinguish 
both KC and T2D patients from control samples. Through protein-protein 
interaction (PPI) network analysis, top-ranked 6 sDEGs (CD74, TFRC, CREB1, MCL1, 
SCARB1 and JUN) were detected as the sKGs that drive both KC and T2D development 
and progression. The most common sKG 'CD74' is associated with key pathways, 
such as NF-κB signaling transduction, apoptotic processes, B cell proliferation. 
Differential expression patterns of sKGs validated by independent datasets of 
NCBI database for T2D and TCGA and GTEx databases for KC. Furthermore, sKGs were 
found to be significant at several CpG sites in DNA methylation studies. 
Regulatory network analysis identified three TFs proteins (SMAD5, ATF1 and 
NR2F1) and two miRNAs (hsa-mir-1-3p and hsa-mir-34a-5p) as the regulators of 
sKGs. The enrichment analysis of sKGs with KEGG-pathways and Gene Ontology (GO) 
terms revealed some crucial shared pathogenetic mechanisms (sPM) between two 
diseases. Finally, sKGs-guided four potential therapeutic drug molecules 
(Imatinib, Pazopanib hydrochloride, Sorafenib and Glibenclamide) were 
recommended as the common therapies for KC with T2D.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study may be useful resources for the diagnosis 
and therapy of KC with the co-existence of T2D.

Mechanisms by which prior tuberculosis (TB) increases long-term risk for cancer, 
cardiovascular, and neurological disorders remain unclear, particularly in 
people with HIV (PWH). This study investigated DNA methylation (DNAm) patterns 
and associated pathways in PWH with and without prior TB infection. DNAm was 
analyzed in blood samples from 30 PWH (10 with prior latent TB infection [LTBI], 
10 with previous successfully treated active TB, and 10 with no TB) using the 
Illumina MethylationEPIC BeadChip covering over 850,000 CpG sites. Epigenetic 
age was estimated, and age acceleration was calculated. Differentially 
methylated CpGs (dmCpGs) and regions (DMRs) were identified, and functional 
enrichment analyses for Gene Ontology, KEGG pathways, PANTHER database, and gene 
set enrichment analysis (DisGeNET, dbGaP) were performed. Statistical 
significance was set at a false discovery rate (FDR) of < 0.05. PWH exhibited 
significant epigenetic age acceleration, with a mean of 19.32 ± 10.82 years 
greater than chronological age. This accelerated aging was more pronounced in 
individuals with any prior TB infection (21.60 ± 12.03 years) compared to those 
without TB (17.42 ± 9.38 years). In the prior active TB vs. no TB comparison, 
7461 dmCpGs were identified, corresponding to 150 DMRs (p < 0.05), with top 
associated genes including GRAMD1C (hypomethylation), DPP6 (hypermethylation), 
and HDAC4 (hypomethylation). In the LTBI vs. no TB comparison, 8598 dmCpGs were 
observed, corresponding to 39 DMRs (p < 0.05), associated with genes such as 
PLEKHG5 (hypermethylation), STK32C (hypermethylation), and SPATC1L. When 
comparing any prior TB (active or latent) to no TB, 71,774 dmCpGs and 14 DMRs 
were identified, including genes like PLEKHG5, KCNN3, and BRSK2. Pathway 
analyses of prior TB (active or latent) vs. no TB revealed enrichment in 
neurogenesis, neuron differentiation, axon guidance, and neuroactive ligand 
signaling. Additional enriched pathways included those related to platelet 
activation, vascular muscle contraction, and chemokine signaling. Cancer-related 
pathways such as proteoglycans in cancer, small cell lung cancer, prostate 
cancer, breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and thyroid cancer were also 
enriched. PANTHER analysis showed consistent enrichment in the Wnt signaling 
pathway and inflammation-mediated pathways across compared groups. DisGeNET 
analysis linked prior TB DNAm patterns to lymphoid leukemia, while dbGaP 
analysis identified associations with phenotypes like asthma, body mass index, 
tunica media, and lymphocyte count. Prior TB infection in PWH is associated with 
distinct DNAm changes in pathways related to neural function, cardiovascular 
health, and cancer risk, and is linked to more pronounced epigenetic age 
acceleration, suggesting epigenetic mechanisms for TB-related long-term 
complications.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality, 
with alcohol consumption implicated in its etiology. However, alcohol's 
prognostic impact on CRC survival is unclear, and self-reported intake is 
limited by bias. This population-based cohort study evaluated blood DNA 
methylation-based alcohol scores as objective prognostic tools in 2,129 CRC 
patients from Germany's DACHS study (2003-2021; median follow-up: 10 years). 
Participants were recruited from 22 hospitals in Southwest Germany, including 
non-metastatic (n = 1757) and metastatic (n = 372) patients with complete 
methylation and alcohol data. All three assessed methylation scores (3-CpG, 
450-CpG, 144-CpG) correlated with self-reported lifetime/recent alcohol intake 
(Spearman's r: 0.29-0.36; p < 0.0001), particularly recent consumption. In 
non-metastatic patients, self-reported alcohol consumption showed a J-shaped 
mortality risk, with elevated risks in heavy drinkers and abstainers. A similar 
dose-response pattern was observed for the 3-CpG methylation score, which showed 
consistent and robust associations with increased overall mortality (adjusted 
hazard ratio [aHR] per standard deviation increase: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.11-1.25), 
non-CRC-related mortality (1.22, 1.13-1.32), and CRC-specific mortality (1.12, 
1.00-1.25). The 450-CpG score was associated with overall mortality (1.07, 
1.00-1.15), non-CRC-related mortality (1.14, 1.05-1.23), and alcohol 
consumption-related mortality (1.59, 1.17-2.16). These findings highlight the 
potential utility of DNA methylation-based alcohol scores, especially the 3-CpG 
and the 450-CpG scores, as prognostic tools for CRC outcomes. Such biomarkers 
may provide a more objective measure of alcohol exposure and complement 
self-reported data in risk stratification and clinical decision-making, though 
further validation is warranted before clinical implementation.

Halobenzoquinones (HBQs), a class of emerging disinfection byproducts (DBPs) 
ubiquitously existed in drinking water, were predicted to be bladder 
carcinogens. HBQs exhibited a unique capacity to promote the conversion of 
5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). Thus, we propose that 
a varied epigenetic landscape may serve as an essential initial molecular event 
in cancer development under HBQs stress. We investigated the global levels of 
cytosine modifications and revealed genome-wide alteration of 5mC and 5hmC 
induced by HBQs in human bladder epithelial cells SV-HUC-1. The results showed 
that the global level of 5hmC significantly increased after exposure to HBQs. 
HBQ exposure resulted in more hypo-methylated (39,365) and 
hyper-hydroxymethylated (26,053) sites, with 7441 overlapping sites, suggesting 
the conversion of 5mC to 5hmC. The genes associated with hypo-differentially 
methylated regions (hypo-DMRs) and hyper-differentially hydroxymethylated 
regions (hyper-DhMRs) were enriched in cancer-related pathways, such as the 
Hippo signaling pathway, PI3K-AKT signaling pathway and Wnt signaling pathway. 
In particular, three bladder cancer-related genes (CASC8, TTTY14, METRNL) 
associated with hypo-DMRs or hyper-DhMRs exhibited significantly differential 
expression. This study revealed epigenetic changes induced by HBQs and a 
potential association with the risk of bladder cancer.
